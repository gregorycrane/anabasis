2 1.1.1 
<s n="1"/> Dareios and Parysatis had two sons, the elder Artaxerxes, the younger Cyros. 
<s n="2"/> When Dareios was ill and expected to die, he wished both his sons to be present. 
<pb n="1"/>

3 1.1.2 
<s n="3"/> The elder was there, as it happened, 
<s n="4"/> but Cyros had to be sent for from the province where he was governor and general-in-chief over all the troops that are stationed in the plain of the Castolos. 
<s n="5"/> Cyros then came up to the capital, taking with him Tissaphernes as his friend, and he brought up 300 men-at-arms of the Hellenic mercenaries under their captain Xenias, a Parrhasian. 
<pb n="2"/>

3 1.1.3 
<s n="6"/> But when Dareios died and Artaxerxes succeeded, Tissaphernes slandered Cyros to his brother and said he was plotting against him. 
<s n="7"/> The king believed him, and seized Cyros to put him to death, 
<s n="8"/> but his mother begged him off and sent him back to his province. 

2 1.1.4 
<s n="9"/> When Cyros got clear of this danger and disgrace, he determined never again to be in his brother’s power, but to make himself king instead, if he could. 
<s n="10"/> Cyros had his mother behind him to begin with, for she loved him more than the reigning Artaxerxes. 

2 1.1.5 
<s n="11"/> Whenever anyone came to Cyros from the court, he treated them all so well that they went away friends to him rather than to the king. 
<s n="12"/> And the native troops he had he carefully trained to take the field, and made them loyal to himself. 

4 1.1.6 
<s n="13"/> Hellenic mercenaries again he assembled in as great force as possible, secretly, in order to keep the king quite unprepared. 
<s n="14"/> This is how he collected them. 
<s n="15"/> He sent word to the governors of all the garrisons he had in various cities, to enlist as many Peloponnesians as they could find, and the best, pretending that Tissaphernes was plotting against the cities. 
<s n="16"/> For in fact the Ionian colonies had belonged to Tissaphernes originally, being given him by the king; but then they had gone over to Cyros, all except Miletos. 
<pb n="3"/>

3 1.1.7 
<s n="17"/> In Miletos, however, Tissaphernes had got wind beforehand that the people were going to do the same, and revolt to Cyros, and he had killed some and banished others. 
<s n="18"/> Cyros gave refuge to the banished men, and collected an army, and laid siege to Miletos by land and sea, and tried to restore the banished: 
<s n="19"/> this was another excuse for him to assemble his army. 

4 1.1.8 
<s n="20"/> He sent also to the king, and asked him as his brother to give him those cities rather than let Tissaphernes rule over them; and his mother worked to help him. 
<s n="21"/> Thus the king did not see the plot against himself, but he thought that war with Tissaphernes was why he spent so much money on the army. 
<s n="22"/> He did not worry about fighting between Cyros and Tissaphernes, 
<s n="23"/> especially as Cyros was careful to send in the proper tribute from the cities that Tissaphernes had in his province. 
<p/>

6 1.1.9 
<s n="24"/> Another army was being collected for him in the Chersonese, opposite Abydos, in the following manner. 
<s n="25"/> Clearchos was a Lacedaimonian exile; 
<s n="26"/> Cyros met him, admired him, and gave him 10,000 darics. 
<s n="27"/> Using this money to collect a force, he made war, with the Chersonese as his base, upon the Thracians who are settled farther up above the Hellespont, and since he thus helped the Hellenes, 
<s n="28"/> the Hellenic cities willingly contributed to the support of his men. 
<s n="29"/> In such way this army again was being secretly kept for Cyros. 
<pb n="4"/>

3 1.1.10 
<s n="30"/> Aristippos the Thessalian was his friend; and he, being hard pressed by the opposing party at home, came to Cyros and asked him to provide three months’ pay for 2,000 men, which he thought would be enough to get the better of his rivals. 
<s n="31"/> Cyros gave him six months’ pay for 4,000, and requested him not to make friends with his rivals without consulting him. 
<s n="32"/> There again was an army in Thessaly being kept ready unnoticed. 
<p/>

3 1.1.11 
<s n="33"/> Proxenos the Boeotian was another friend; Cyros begged him to get as many men as he could and join him, since he was about to attack the Pisidians who were making themselves a nuisance to his country. 
<s n="34"/> Two other friends, Sophainetos the Stymphalian and Socrates the Achaian, he told to join him with as large forces as possible, because he was going to make war on Tissaphernes along with the Milesian exiles. 
<s n="35"/> And so they did. 
<p/>

4 1.2.1 
<s n="36"/> When he thought the time had come to march up country, he made the excuse that he wanted to expel the Pisidians from the land altogether; and he summoned both his national forces and the Hellenic to meet for this purpose. 
<s n="37"/> He also sent word to Clearchos to bring up all his army; 
<s n="38"/> and to Aristippos, to make terms with his rivals at home and to send the whole army to himself. 
<s n="39"/> He ordered Xenias also, who was in general command of the foreign troops in the cities, to bring them all up except as many as were enough to garrison the fortresses. 
<p/>

4 1.2.2 
<s n="40"/> and except those who were besieging Miletos; the exiles he told to come too, promising them that if he should succeed in his purpose, he would not cease until he could restore them to their home. 
<s n="41"/> They obeyed gladly, 
<s n="42"/> for they trusted him, 
<s n="43"/> and proceeded to Sardis under arms. 
<p/>

2 1.2.3 
<s n="44"/> Accordingly Xenias came also to Sardis with about 4,000 men-at-arms; Proxenos was there with 1,500 and 500 light-armed men, Sophainetos the Stymphalian with 1,000 men-at-arms, Socrates the Achaian with about 500, Pasion the Megarian with 300 men-at-arms and 300 targeteers;
<s n="45"/> he and Socrates had been among those besieging Miletos.

 
<p/>

2 1.2.4 
<s n="46"/> This was the force that assembled at Sardis; 
<s n="47"/> Tissaphernes took note of this, and thought it was too large for the Pisidians, and so he marched to the king as quickly as possible with 500 horse. 
<s n="48"/> And the king made preparations to resist Cyros’s plan, when he heard about it from Tissaphernes. 
<p/>

5 1.2.5 
<s n="49"/> Cyros then, with the forces I have mentioned, set out from Sardis. 
<s n="50"/> Three stages, 22 leagues, brought him as far as the River Maiandros. 
<s n="51"/> The river is 200 feet wide, 
<s n="52"/> with a bridge supported on floating vessels. 
<p/>

3 1.2.6 
<s n="53"/> Crossing this, he travelled through Phrygia, one stage, 8 leagues, to Colossai, an inhabited city, large and prosperous. 
<s n="54"/> There he stayed seven days; 
<s n="55"/> and there Menon the Thessalian joined him, with 1,000 men-at-arms and 500 targeteers, Dolopians and Ainanians and Olynthians. 
<p/>

5 1.2.7 
<s n="56"/> Thence he passed on three stages, 20 leagues, to Celainai, an inhabited city of Phrygia, large and prosperous. 
<s n="57"/> There Cyros had a palace, and a great park full of wild animals, which he used to hunt on horseback when he wished to exercise himself and his horses. 
<s n="58"/> Through this park flows the River Maiandros, 
<s n="59"/> and the source is in the palace; 
<s n="60"/> it flows also through the city of Celainai. 
<p/>

5 1.2.8 
<s n="61"/> There is also a palace of the Great King in Celainai, deserted, at the source of the River Marsyas under the Acropolis; 
<s n="62"/> this river also flows through the city and discharges into the Maiandros. 
<s n="63"/> The width of the Marsyas is 25 feet. 
<s n="64"/> There it is said Apollo flayed Marsyas, who had challenged him to a music-match, 
<s n="65"/> and hung up the skin in the cave where the source is; and therefore the river is named Marsyas. 
<p/>

5 1.2.9 
<s n="66"/> This palace and the fortress Xerxes is said to have built when he came back after the defeat in Greece. 
<s n="67"/> There Cyros remained thirty days; 
<s n="68"/> and Clearchos the Lacedaimonian exile joined him, with 1,000 men-at-arms, and 800 Thracian targeteers, and 200 Cretan bowmen. 
<s n="69"/> At the same time Sosis the Syracusan came in with 300 men-at-arms, and Sophainetos with 1,000 from Arcadia. 
<s n="70"/> There Cyros held a review, and counted the Hellenic mercenaries in the park; there were in all 11,000 men-at-arms, and about 2,000 targeteers. 
<p/>

5 1.2.10 
<s n="71"/> From this place he marched two stages, 10 leagues, to Peltai, an inhabited city, 
<s n="72"/> where he stayed three days. 
<s n="73"/> In this halt Xenias the Arcadian celebrated the feast Lycaia and held sports; 
<s n="74"/> the prizes were golden skin-scrapers, 
<s n="75"/> and Cyros looked on at the contest. 
<p/>

6 1.2.11 
<s n="76"/> From this place he marched two stages, 12 leagues, to Potters’ Market, an inhabited city, on the boundary of Mysia. 
<s n="77"/> From there he marched three stages, 30 leagues, to the plain of the Caystros, an inhabited city, 
<s n="78"/> where he stayed five days. 
<s n="79"/> More than three months’ wages were now due to the soldiers, and they came often to his door to ask for it. 
<s n="80"/> He talked of expectations and put them off; 
<s n="81"/> but he was clearly annoyed, for it was not the way of Cyros, if he had, not to give. 
<p/>

5 1.2.12 
<s n="82"/> At this place came to Cyros Epyaxa, wife of Syennesis, King of the Cilicians, 
<s n="83"/> and she was said to have given him large sums of money, so Cyros paid the army four months’ wages. 
<s n="84"/> The Cilician queen had a bodyguard of Cilicians and Aspendians; 
<s n="85"/> and Cyros was said to have been intimate with her. 
<p/>

2 1.2.13 
<s n="86"/> Thence he marched two stages, 10 leagues, to Thymbrion, an inhabited city. 
<s n="87"/> There by the side of the road was the spring named after Midas the Phrygian king, 
<s n="88"/> where Midas was said to have caught the Satyr by mixing wine with the water. 
<p/>

4 1.2.14 
<s n="89"/> Thence two stages, 10 leagues, to Tyriaion, an inhabited city, 
<s n="90"/> where he stayed three days. 
<s n="91"/> The Cilician is said to have begged him to show her a display of the army. 
<s n="92"/> So he reviewed his troops, national and Hellenic, on the plain. 
<p/>

3 1.2.15 
<s n="93"/> He ordered the Hellenes to put themselves in battle array after their own fashion, each captain commanding his own men. 
<s n="94"/> So they paraded four deep; 
<s n="95"/> Menon held the right wing and Clearchos the left, the others in the centre. 
<p/>

4 1.2.16 
<s n="96"/> First Cyros inspected the nationals; 
<s n="97"/> they marched past in troops of horse and companies of foot. 
<s n="98"/> Then the Hellenes, Cyros driving by in a car and the Cilician in her state wagon. 
<s n="99"/> All the men wore bronze helmets and purple tunics and greaves, and had their shields uncovered. 
<p/>

4 1.2.17 
<s n="100"/> When he had driven by them all, he halted his car in front of the central line and sent Pigres the interpreter to the Hellenic captains with the order to present pikes and advance the whole line. 
<s n="101"/> The captains passed on the order to the men; 
<s n="102"/> and when the trumpet sounded, they presented pikes and advanced. 
<s n="103"/> Then the pace quickened. The men doubled towards the tents with cheers of their own accord. 
<p/>

3 1.2.18 
<s n="104"/> There was a panic among the national troops, and the Cilician fled in her wagon, and the people from the market fled too, leaving their goods behind. 
<s n="105"/> The Cilician was amazed to see the brilliancy and discipline of the army; 
<s n="106"/> and Cyros was delighted when he saw how the natives were scared by the Hellenes. 
<p/>

4 1.2.19 
<s n="107"/> From this place he went three stages, 20 leagues, to Iconion, the last city of Phrygia, 
<s n="108"/> where he stayed three days. 
<s n="109"/> Thence he marched through Lycaonia five stages, 30 leagues. 
<s n="110"/> He gave this part over to the Hellenes to despoil as enemy country. 
<p/>

5 1.2.20 
<s n="111"/> After that Cyros sent the Cilician back to her own country the quickest way, 
<s n="112"/> and with her he sent Menon and his men. 
<s n="113"/> But Cyros marched along with the others through Cappadocia four stages, 25 leagues, to Dana, an inhabited city, large and prosperous, 
<s n="114"/> where they stayed three days. 
<s n="115"/> Here Cyros put to death a Persian, Megaphernes, one who wore the royal purple, and another high official, one of the lieutenant-governors, on the charge of conspiracy against him. 
<p/>

5 1.2.21 
<s n="116"/> After that they tried to break into Cilicia; 
<s n="117"/> but the entry was a carriage road, very straight and impossible for an army to enter if anyone resisted. 
<s n="118"/> Syennesis was said to be on the heights guarding the pass, 
<s n="119"/> and Cyros therefore stayed one day in the plain. 
<s n="120"/> But next day news came that Syennesis had left the heights when he found that Menon’s force already was in Cilicia and behind the mountains, and that a fleet of war under Tamôs was sailing round to Cilicia from Ionia, a fleet that belonged to the Lacedaimonians and to Cyros himself. 
<p/>

4 1.2.22 
<s n="121"/> So Cyros came up that pass into the mountains without opposition, and saw the tents where the Cilicians had been on the watch. 
<s n="122"/> After that he came down into a large and beautiful plain well watered, and full of all sorts of trees and vines, bearing plenty of sesamum, too, and millet and barley and wheat; 
<s n="123"/> a strong and lofty wall of mountains surrounds it everywhere from sea to sea. 
<p/>

2 1.2.23 
<s n="124"/> Coming down he marched through this plain four stages, 25 leagues, to Tarsus, a city of Cilicia both large and prosperous, 
<s n="125"/> where was the palace of Syennesis, King of Cilicia; 
<s n="126"/> through the midst of the city flows a river called Cydnos, 200 feet across. 
<p/>

2 1.2.24 
<s n="127"/> The inhabitants, with Syennesis, had left it and gone to a strong place in the hills, except those who had goods for sale; 
<s n="128"/> those who lived by the sea also remained, and those in Soli and Issos. 
<p/>

4 1.2.25 
<s n="129"/> Epyaxa, the wife of Syennesis, had reached Tarsus five days before Cyros; 
<s n="130"/> but in crossing the mountains two companies of Menon’s force had been lost; 
<s n="131"/> some said they had been cut down by the Cilicians while plundering, others that they had been left behind and could not find their party, and lost their way and wandered about till they perished. 
<s n="132"/> In any case they were a hundred men-at-arms. 
<p/>

3 1.2.26 
<s n="133"/> When the others came in they were enraged at the destruction of their comrades, and plundered Tarsus and the palace there. 
<s n="134"/> When Cyros entered the place he summoned Syennesis; 
<s n="135"/> but Syennesis said he had never yet put himself in the hands of one stronger than himself, and he would not come to Cyros then, until his wife persuaded him and got promises of safety. 
<p/>

2 1.2.27 
<s n="136"/> After this, when they met, Syennesis gave Cyros large sums of money for his campaign, 
<s n="137"/> and Cyros gave him such gifts as are thought honourable for a king, a horse with golden bit and bridle, and a gold necklace and bracelets, and a gold scimitar and Persian robes, and promised no more to plunder the country; he should have back the captives whenever he found any. 
<p/>

6 1.3.1 
<s n="138"/> There Cyros and the army stayed twenty days, 
<s n="139"/> for the soldiers said they would go no farther; 
<s n="140"/> they already suspected that they were marching against the king, 
<s n="141"/> and said they had not been hired for that. 
<s n="142"/> Clearchos first tried to compel his men to go on; 
<s n="143"/> but they pelted him and his animals as soon as they started, and Clearchos had a narrow escape then of being stoned to death. 
<p/>

4 1.3.2 
<s n="144"/> But after he saw he could not compel them he called a public meeting of all the men. 
<s n="145"/> He began by standing before them for some time with tears running down his cheeks, 
<s n="146"/> and the men were silent in surprise; 
<s n="147"/> then he spoke as follows: 
<p/>

3 1.3.3 
<s n="148"/> “Men and comrades, don’t be surprised that I am deeply hurt by what has happened. 
<s n="149"/> Cyros has been my friend; when I was banished from my country, he treated me with respect, and also gave me ten thousand darics; 
<s n="150"/> and when I received this money I did not put it by as my own, or spend it on luxuries, but I spent it on you. 
<p/>

2 1.3.4 
<s n="151"/> Then first I made war on the Thracians, and with your help punished them for the wrongs of Hellas. 
<s n="152"/> I drove them from the Chersonese, where they wished to rob our countrymen of their land. Afterwards, when Cyros called me, I marched with you to him, that if he needed me I might show my gratitude for his benefits. 
<p/>

3 1.3.5 
<s n="153"/> “But since you will not march with me, I must of necessity either desert you and enjoy his friendship, or else deceive him and stay with you. 
<s n="154"/> If it will be right I do not know; but in any case I will choose you, and with you suffer whatever I must suffer. 
<s n="155"/> No-one shall ever say that I led Hellenes against savages, and then deserted the Hellenes and chose the friendship of savages. 
<p/>

2 1.3.6 
<s n="156"/> But since you will not obey me, I will go with you and suffer whatever I must suffer. 
<s n="157"/> For I consider that you are my country and my friends and comrades; and with you I think I shall be honoured wherever I may be, but without you, I think I am not able either to help a friend or hurt an enemy. Where you go there I will go also: that is my resolve.” 
<p/>

<section n="1.3.7" sentences="3">
 <s n="158"/>So he spoke, and the soldiers all cheered him, both his own and the others who heard, when he said he would not march against the king;
 <s n="159"/>and more than two thousand from Xenias and Pasion took their arms and baggage
 <s n="160"/>and encamped beside Clearchos.
</section>

 <section n="4" chapter="1.3.8">
 <s n="161"/>Cyros was very much upset and did not know what to do. He sent for Clearchos,
 <s n="162"/>but Clearchos did not wish to go himself; he sent him a message, however, unknown to the soldiers, and told him not to worry, all would turn out well;
 <s n="163"/>but he should go on sending for him,
 <s n="164"/>and he would refuse to come.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.3.9">
 <s n="165"/>After that Clearchos collected his own men, and those who had joined him, and anyone else who liked, and spoke to them after this fashion:
 <s n="166"/>“Men and comrades, it is clear now how things are between us and Cyros:
 <s n="167"/>we are no longer his men, since we do not follow him; and he no longer finds our pay.
 </section>

 <section n="2" chapter="1.3.10">
 <s n="168"/>He thinks you are in the wrong, I know;
 <s n="169"/>and that is why I will not go when he sends for me. The chief reason is, I am ashamed because my conscience tells me I have broken faith with him altogether; next I am afraid that if he catches me he may punish me for the wrong he thinks I have done.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.3.11">
 <s n="170"/>“Then I think it is no time for us to sleep or neglect ourselves; we must make some plan.
 <s n="171"/>As long as we remain here I think we must arrange to be as safe as possible; or if we decide to go at once, we must arrange to go as safely as possible and to find provisions,
 <s n="172"/>for without this there’s no good in a captain and no good in a man.”
 </section>

 <section n="4" chapter="1.3.12">
 <s n="173"/>But this man is worth much as a friend, and very dangerous as an enemy: he has forces in foot and horse and fleet, which we all see and understand quite well.
 <s n="174"/>Indeed, I don’t think we should sit here any longer.
 <s n="175"/>So now’s the time to say what is best; speak up, someone.”
 <s n="176"/>He said this and ceased;
 </section>

 <section n="1" chapter="1.3.13">
 <s n="177"/>and people got up, some of themselves to tell what they proposed, others prompted by him, who pointed out what a mess they were in without the support of Cyros, whether they stayed or marched.
 </section>

 <section n="7" chapter="1.3.14">
 <s n="178"/>One indeed pretended he was in a hurry that they should march for Hellas as quickly as they could,
 <s n="179"/>and told them to choose captains with all expedition, if Clearchos did not want to lead them;
 <s n="180"/>provisions they must buy (there was a market in the national army) and pack up their traps;
 <s n="181"/>they must go and ask Cyros for ships to sail in; 
 <s n="182"/>if he would not grant this, ask him for a guide to see they travelled among friends.
 <s n="183"/>If he would not give so much as a guide, they must put themselves in order at once and send men on ahead to occupy the heights, or else Cyros might get there first, or the Cilicians—don’t forget we have taken many of them and their goods.
 <s n="184"/>After this speech Clearchos got up and said:
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.3.15">
 <s n="185"/>“Me to be captain of this march—let no-one say such a thing! I see many reasons why I cannot do that.
 <s n="186"/>But I will be ruled by the man you choose, whoever he may be,
 <s n="187"/>to show you I know how to obey as well as any man on earth!”
 </section>

 <section n="2" chapter="1.3.16">
 <s n="188"/>After this another got up, and showed how silly the man was who advised them to ask Cyros for ships.
 <s n="189"/>Did they think he would turn his feet backwards? How silly to ask for a guide from a man when we have just spoilt his business! And if we trust the guide he gives us, what hinders him from giving orders to occupy the heights first?
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.3.17">
 <s n="190"/>“I should be sorry myself to embark in any ships he might give. Suppose he sinks us and the ships!
 <s n="191"/>I should be afraid to follow the guide he might give. Suppose he leads us to a place we can’t get out from!
 <s n="192"/>I should wish to get away without his consent, unnoticed; and that is impossible.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.3.18">
 <s n="193"/>“I tell you all this is nonsense.
 <s n="194"/>I propose that Clearchos go with suitable people, and ask what Cyros means to do with us;
 <s n="195"/>and if his business now is like what he did with other hired soldiers before, that we follow him too and show ourselves no worse than those whom he brought up country earlier;
 </section>
</text>
 <section n="4" chapter="1.3.19">
 <s n="196"/>but if the business is bigger than the other, and more difficult and dangerous, demand that he either persuade us and we will go, or be persuaded and let us depart in friendship.
 <s n="197"/>In that way, if we follow him we shall be friends and follow willingly, and if we depart we shall depart safely.
 <s n="198"/>Let them report to us whatever he says;
 <s n="199"/>he will listen and decide accordingly.”
 </section>

 <section n="4" chapter="1.3.20">
 <s n="200"/>This was agreed; they chose the persons and sent them with Clearchos, and they asked Cyros the questions which the army thought proper.
 <s n="201"/>He answered, that he heard an enemy of his, Abrocomas, was on the River Euphrates twelve stages away;
 <s n="202"/>he said he wanted to march against this man, and if he was there he wished to punish him,
 <s n="203"/>but if he were gone, we will consider what to do.

 <section n="5" chapter="1.3.21">
 <s n="204"/>The chosen men reported this answer to the soldiers; 
 <s n="205"/>they had a suspicion that he was leading them against the king, still all the same they decided to follow.
 <s n="206"/>But they asked more pay;
 <s n="207"/>and Cyros promised to pay them all half as much again as they had had before, instead of one daric, one and a half each month per man;
 <s n="208"/>but as to the king, no-one heard one single word about that, in public at least.

 <s n="209"/>From that place he marched two stages, 10 leagues, to the River Pharos, which was 300 feet across.

 <s n="211"/>Thence two stages, 15 leagues, to Issoi, the last inhabited city of Cilicia, lying by the seaside, a large and prosperous place.

 <s n="215"/>A Lacedaimonian Cheirisophos was also in this fleet, sent for by Cyros; and he brought 700 men-at-arms, whose captain was on the side of Cyros.
 <s n="216"/>The ships were anchored opposite Cyros’s tent.
 <s n="217"/>There were also the Hellenic mercenaries from Abrocomas, 400 men-at-arms; they had left him and come over to Cyros for his expedition against the king.
 </section>

 <section n="7" chapter="1.4.4">
 <s n="218"/>From that place he marched one stage, 5 leagues, to the Gates of Cilicia and Syria.
 <s n="219"/>These were two forts; the inner one, in front of Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a Cilician garrison; the other one, in front of Syria, was said to be held by a king’s garrison.
 <s n="220"/>Between the two forts runs a river named Carsos, 100 feet wide.
 <s n="221"/>The whole distance between the two forts was 3 furlongs.
 <s n="222"/>No force could get through;
 <s n="223"/>for the pass was narrow, and the walls ran down to the sea, and above were high-clambering rocks:
 <s n="224"/>both fortresses had gates.
 </section>

 <section n="2" chapter="1.4.5">
 <s n="225"/>Because of this pass Cyros had sent for the ships; he would land forces both within and without the gates, and fight his way through the enemy if they were protecting the Syrian Gates, which he expected Abrocomas to do with a large army.
 <s n="226"/>But Abrocomas did not do this: when he heard Cyros was in Cilicia, he left Phoenicia and marched to the king, with an army of 300,000 as it was reported.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.4.6">
 <s n="227"/>From here Cyros marched through Syria one stage, 5 leagues, to Myriandros, a city inhabited by Phoenicians beside the sea:
 <s n="228"/>the place was a port of trade, and a great many merchant ships were anchored there.
 <s n="229"/>In this place he stayed seven days.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.4.7">
 <s n="230"/>Here Xenias the Arcadian and Pasion the Megarian put their valuables aboard a ship and sailed off; being offended, as most people thought, because Cyros allowed Clearchos to keep the men who had deserted to Clearchos, when they meant to go back to Hellas and not against the king.
 <s n="231"/>When these two could not be found, word went about that Cyros was in pursuit with warships;
 <s n="232"/>some hoped the cowards would be caught, others pitied them if they should be caught.
 </section>

 <section n="10" chapter="1.4.8">
 <s n="233"/>But Cyros called a meeting of the captains and said:
 <s n="234"/>“Xenias and Pasion have left us.
 <s n="235"/>But be sure they have not deserted: 
 <s n="236"/>I know where they have gone.
 <s n="237"/>Nor have they escaped: 
 <s n="238"/>I have galleys to catch their boat.
 <s n="239"/>But by God I will not pursue them!
 <s n="240"/>No-one shall say that I use a man while he is with me, but if he wants to go I catch him and maltreat him and rob him of his goods.
 <s n="241"/>Let them go, and remember that they treat us worse than we treat them.
 <s n="242"/>Indeed I have their wives and children still, guarded in Tralles; but they shall not lose them. They shall have them again in return for their good service so far.”
 </section>

 <section n="4" chapter="1.4.9">
 <s n="243"/>That was what he said.
 <s n="244"/>And when the Hellenes heard the fine spirit of Cyros, if anyone was rather discouraged about the enterprise, they went on more happily and more willingly.
 <s n="245"/>After this, Cyros marched four stages, 20 leagues, to the River Chalos, 100 feet wide, which was full of large tame fish, which the Syrians, revering as gods, would not let anyone hurt—or the pigeons either.
 <s n="246"/>The villages where they encamped belonged to Parysatis, given for the queen’s girdle.
 </section>

 <section n="3" chapter="1.4.10">
 <s n="247"/>Thence he marched five stages, 30 leagues, to the source of the River Dardas, breadth 100 feet.
 <s n="248"/>There was the palace of Belesys, the ruler of Syria, and a park large and beautiful, which contains all the kindly fruits of the earth,
 <s n="249"/>But Cyros cut down the trees and burnt the palace.
 </section>

 <section n="5" chapter="1.4.11">
 <s n="250"/>From there, three stages, 15 leagues, to the Euphrates, half a mile in width; 
 <s n="251"/>and a large prosperous town was there named Thapsacos, 
 <s n="252"/>where he stayed five days.
 <s n="253"/>Cyros assembled the Hellenic captains, and told them their road was to the Great King at Babylon.
 <s n="254"/>they were to inform the men and persuade them to follow.
 </section>

 <section n="2" chapter="1.4.12">
 <s n="255"/>So they called a public meeting and informed them.
 <s n="256"/> The men were angry with their captains, and said they had known this all along and hidden it from them; said they would not march, unless they were paid as the former expedition had been which had marched up country with Cyros to the father of Cyros, and then not for battle but invited by the father of Cyros.
 </section>



<section n="4" chapter="1.4.13">
 <s n="257"/> This the captains reported to Cyros; 
 <s n="258"/>and he promised to give each man five minas of silver when they reached Babylon, and pay in full until he should bring the Hellenes back to Ionia. 
 <s n="259"/> Most of them agreed to this offer. 
 <s n="260"/> But Menon mustered his own detachment apart, before it was clear what the other captains would do, and said to them:
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.4.14">
 <s n="261"/> “Men, listen to me. You will be able to win credit with Cyros above the others, without danger and without trouble. 
 <s n="262"/> Then what do I advise you to do? 
 <s n="263"/> Now Cyros asks the Hellenes to follow him against the king: 
 <s n="264"/> I say you ought to cross the Euphrates before it is clear what the others will answer. 
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.4.15">
 <s n="265"/> If they vote to follow, you will be thought to be the cause, by crossing first; Cyros will think you the most ready and willing, and he will thank you and prove his gratitude—he knows how to do that better than anyone. 
 <s n="266"/>If they vote against, we shall all go back together, but you he will trust most as the only ones ready to obey, and he will put you in charge of garrisons or other commands; 
 <s n="267"/> whatever else you may want, I know you will find Cyros a friend.” 
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.4.16">
 <s n="268"/> When they heard this, they complied, and went across before the others made any answer. 
 <s n="269"/> Cyros was delighted when he heard they had crossed, and sent Glûs to tell them so: he said: 
 <s n="270"/> “I am pleased with you now, men, 
 <s n="271"/>and I will take care you shall be pleased with me, or my name is no longer Cyros!”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.4.17">
 <s n="272"/> The soldiers were in high hopes, and prayed good fortune for him; it was said also that he sent magnificent gifts for Menon. 
 <note>Menon figures in Plato as fond of money, and “the spoilt child of fortune."</note> 
 <s n="273"/> Then Cyros crossed, and the whole army followed. 
 <s n="274"/> In the crossing, no-one was wetted above the breast. 
 <s n="275"/> The people of Thapsacos said that this river had never been fordable for foot soldiers before that; it could be crossed only by boats, and Abrocomas had burnt them all on his way past, that Cyros might not cross.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.4.18">
 <s n="276"/> In the crossing, no-one was wetted above the breast. 
 <s n="277"/> The people of Thapsacos said that this river had never been fordable for foot soldiers before that; it could be crossed only by boats, and Abrocomas had burnt them all on his way past, that Cyros might not cross. This was believed to be a sign from heaven, and the river had plainly made way for Cyros as destined to be king.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.4.19">
 <s n="278"/> From that place he marched through Syria nine stages 50 leagues, 
 <s n="279"/>as far as the River Araxes. 
 <s n="280"/> Many villages were there, full of corn and wine; 
 <s n="281"/> there they stayed three days and got provisions.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.5.1">
 <s n="282"/> Thence he marched through Arabia, keeping the Euphrates on the right, five stages of desert, 35 leagues. 
 <s n="283"/> In this part the country was one great flat plain like a sea, but covered with absinth; 
 <s n="284"/> whatever there was besides of wood or reeds, all were sweet-smelling like spices.
</section>

<section n="7" chapter="1.5.2">
 <s n="285"/> There was no tree, but all sorts of animals, troops of wild asses, plenty of ostriches, 
 <s n="286"/>bustards also and gazelles; 
 <s n="287"/> and the horsemen often chased these. 
 <s n="288"/> The asses, if they were chased, ran ahead and stood still, 
 <s n="289"/> for they ran much faster than horses. 
 <s n="290"/> When the horses came near, they ran as before, and they could not be caught unless the horsemen placed themselves at intervals and hunted in relays. 
 <s n="291"/> The meat of those caught was like venison but more tender.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.5.3">
 <s n="292"/> No-one caught an ostrich; 
 <s n="293"/> horsemen in chase soon gave up, 
 <s n="294"/>for she got far away before them, running on her feet and flying too, using her wings like a sail. 
 <s n="295"/> Bustards, however, can be caught if you put them up smartly, 
 <s n="296"/>for they fly in short spurts like a partridge and quickly tire. 
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.5.4">
 <s n="297"/> Their flesh was very good.
 <s n="298"/> Marching through this country they came to the River Mascas, width 100 feet. 
 <s n="299"/> There was a great deserted city named Corsote; 
 <s n="300"/> this was surrounded by the Mascas.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.5.5">
 <s n="301"/> There they stayed three days and got provisions. 
 <s n="302"/> From that place he marched thirteen desert stages, 90 leagues, keeping the Euphrates on his right, until he reached the Gates. 
 <s n="303"/> In these stages many of the baggage-animals were starved to death, 
 <s n="304"/>for there was neither grass nor any sort of tree, but the whole country was bare: 
 <s n="305"/> the natives used to dig up grinding-stones beside the river and shape them, and these they took to Babylon and sold them there, and bought corn to feed themselves.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.5.6">
 <s n="306"/> Corn failed the army, and none could be bought except in the Lydian market which Cyros had in his national camp, four shekels for a capith of wheat or barley: 
 <s n="307"/> the shekel is worth seven and a half Attic obols, 
 <s n="308"/>and the capith is two Attic quarts. 
 <note>The Attic drachma contained six obols; so 7.5 obols is 1.25 drachmas. The quart, or choinix, was a man’s daily allowance of corn, minimum.</note> 
 <s n="309"/> So the men had to manage by eating meat.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.5.7">
 <s n="310"/> Some of the stages were very long, when he wished to get on to water or grass. 
 <s n="311"/> Once indeed when there was a narrow way and deep mud, bad going for the carriages, Cyros took charge with the noblest and richest of his staff, and ordered Glûs and Pigres to take some of his nationals and get the carriages through.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.5.8">
 <s n="312"/> As they seemed to be lazy about it, he was angry, and told the noble Persians beside him to lend a hand with the wagons. 
 <s n="313"/> Then could be seen something of his discipline. 
 <s n="314"/> Each man of them threw off his purple robe where he stood, and away they went as one might run a race! 
 <s n="315"/> Down the steep hill they went, in their costly tunics and embroidered breeches, and some with necklaces round their necks and bracelets on their arms; in this garb they jumped straight into the mud, and quicker than one could think possible they got the wagons clear.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.5.9">
 <s n="316"/> Take it in all, Cyros showed himself to be in earnest throughout the march, and wasted no time except where he had to sit still for vittling or some other necessity. 
 <s n="317"/> For he thought that the quicker he came, the less prepared for the fight would the king be. And it was easy to see for any sensible man that the king’s empire might be strong in extent and population, but it was weak by the long distances between his scattered forces if war were made suddenly with speed.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.5.10">
 <s n="318"/> On the other side of the Euphrates in the desert was a city great and prosperous named Charmande; 
 <s n="319"/> from this place the soldiers bought provisions, and they crossed on rafts in this way. 
 <s n="320"/> They took the skins which they used to cover their tents and stuffed them with hay, then folded and sewed them up to keep the water from the hay. 
 <s n="321"/> On these they crossed, and got their provisions, wine made from dates and millet corn, 
 <s n="322"/>which was commonest in that country.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.5.11">
 <s n="323"/> There was some quarrel there between Menon’s soldiers and those of Clearchos, when Clearchos judged that one of Menon’s men was in the wrong and flogged him. 
 <s n="324"/> Menon went and told his party; 
 <s n="325"/> the men were displeased and very angry with Clearchos.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.5.12">
 <s n="326"/> On the same day Clearchos had gone to the crossing place, and after inspecting the market there he rode back to his tent with a few followers through Menon’s camp. 
 <s n="327"/> Cyros had not yet come, but he was on the way. 
 <s n="328"/> One of Menon’s men splitting wood saw Clearchos riding past, and threw the axe at him. 
 <s n="329"/> This man missed him, 
	<s n="330"/> but another threw a stone, and another, then many with shouts and cries.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.5.13">
 <s n="331"/> Clearchos got away into his own camp, and at once called them to arms; 
 <s n="332"/>he told his own men to lean their shields against their knees, 
 <note>ready to receive cavalry</note> 
 <s n="333"/> and himself with the Thracians and horsemen he had in the camp, more than forty but mostly Thracians, he rode for Menon’s division. These were astounded and so was Menon, and all ran for their arms, some standing still on the spot in dismay.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.5.14">
 <s n="334"/> Proxenos happened to come in behind them with a company of his men-at-arms, and he went straight in between them and grounded arms, and begged Clearchos to desist. 
 <s n="335"/> But Clearchos was angry to hear his danger lightly spoken of when he had hardly escaped being stoned to death, and told him to get out of the way.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.5.15">
 <s n="336"/> At this moment Cyros came up and asked what the matter was. 
 <s n="337"/> At once he took his javelin in hand and galloped in with those of his bodyguard that he had with him and said:
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.5.16">
 <s n="338"/> “Now then, Clearchos and Proxenos and you others, you don’t know what you are doing. 
 <s n="339"/> If you make a fight among yourselves, understand that you will cut me to pieces this very day, and yourselves very soon after me! 
 <s n="340"/> For if anything goes wrong with us, these people you see round us here will all be worse enemies to us than the king’s army.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.5.17">
 <s n="341"/> Clearchos came to himself when he heard this; 
 <s n="342"/> both parties desisted, and went back quietly to their own quarters.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.6.1">
 <s n="343"/> As they moved onwards from this place, tracks of horses appeared, and dung. 
 <s n="344"/> There seemed to be traces of something like two thousand horses. 
 <s n="345"/> They were going ahead and burning the grass and anything else that was useful. 
 <s n="346"/> Orontas, a Persian who was there, himself one of the royal family, and said to be one of the best men in Persia in military matters, made a treacherous proposal. He had formerly been at war with Cyros but made it up.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.6.2">
 <s n="347"/> Now he told Cyros that if he would give him a thousand horsemen, he would either lie in wait for this incinerating vanguard and kill the lot, 
 <s n="348"/> or else bring in a good many and stop their incinerating, and he would take care that they should never be able to see Cyros’s army and take the news to the king.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.6.3">
 <s n="349"/> Cyros thought this sounded like useful advice, and he told him to take a part from each of the commanders. 
 <s n="350"/> So Orontas thought the horsemen were there ready for him, and wrote a letter to the king that he would come and bring with him as many horsemen as possible. 
 <s n="351"/> He must warn his own cavalry to receive him as a friend. 
 <s n="352"/> In the letter were also reminders of their former friendship and trust. 
 <s n="353"/> This letter he gave to a trusty man, as he thought; but the man took it and gave it to Cyros.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.6.4">
 <s n="354"/> Cyros read it, and arrested Orontas, and summoned to his own tent seven of the noblest men about him, 
 <s n="355"/> and directed the Hellenic captains to bring armed men and post them around his tent. They did so, and brought some three thousand men-at-arms.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.6.5">
 <s n="356"/> He invited Clearchos in to be one of the court, for he thought him to be the leading man among all the Hellenes, and this was the public opinion too. 
 <s n="357"/> Afterwards he told his friends how Cyros conducted the court-martial; 
 <s n="358"/> for it was no secret.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.6.6">
 <s n="359"/> Cyros began in this way: “I have summoned you, my friends, that I may consult you what is right to do before God and man, and so I may do about Orontas, who is here. 
 <s n="360"/> This man was first given me by my father to be my subject. 
 <s n="361"/> Then under orders, as he said himself, from my brother, he made war against me when he held the fortress of Sardis; and I took up the challenge and made him decide to cease war against me, and we clasped hands. 
 <s n="362"/> After that, is there any wrong I have done you, Orontas?”
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="1.6.7">
 <s n="363"/> He said, “No.” 
 <s n="364"/> Again Cyros asked. 
 <s n="365"/> “Then I did you no wrong after that, as you admit yourself, but did you desert to the Mysians and damage my country as much as you could?” 
 <s n="366"/> Orontas said, “Yes.” 
 <s n="367"/> “Very well,” said Cyros; “when you found out your own weakness, did you take refuge at the altar of Artemis, and say you were sorry, and did I believe you, and did we both pledge loyalty and friendship together?” 
 <s n="368"/> This also Orontas acknowledged.
</section>

<section n="7" chapter="1.6.8">
 <s n="369"/> “Then what wrong have I done you now,” said Cyros, “that for the third time you have been discovered planning treachery against me?” 
 <s n="370"/> Orontas said that he had suffered no wrong. 
 <s n="371"/> Cyros asked: “Do you admit, then, that you have done wrong to me?” 
 <s n="372"/> “I can’t help it,” 
 <s n="373"/> said Orontas. 
 <s n="374"/> Then Cyros asked again: “And could you ever become an enemy to my brother again, and a faithful friend to me?” 
 <s n="375"/> He answered, “Even if I should, Cyros, you would never believe it.”
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.6.9">
 <s n="376"/> Then Cyros turned to the court and said, 
 <s n="377"/> “That is what the man has done, you hear what he says. 
 <s n="378"/> You speak first, Clearchos; what is your judgment?” 
 <s n="379"/> Clearchos said, 
 <s n="380"/> “My advice is to get rid of this man at once, that we need not be obliged to watch him, but we may have leisure from him to do our best for these willing helpers.”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.6.10">
 <s n="381"/> He said the others agreed with this judgment. 
 <s n="382"/> After this, he said, at the bidding of Cyros, all those present, including the man’s kinsmen, rose and took hold of the girdle of Orontas as a sign that he must die. 
 <s n="383"/> Then he was led away by those whose duty it was. 
 <s n="384"/> But those who did reverence to him before, did reverence then, when they saw him, although they knew he was being led away to death.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.6.11">
 <s n="385"/> He was taken into the tent of Artapates, the most trusty of all Cyros’s wand-bearers, but after that no one ever saw Orontas alive or dead, and no one who knew ever told how he died. 
 <s n="386"/> People guessed all sorts of things, 
 <s n="387"/> but no tomb of Orontas was ever seen.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.7.1">
 <s n="388"/> From that place he marched through Babylonia three stages, 12 leagues. 
 <s n="389"/> In the third stage Cyros held a review of Hellenes and national troops on the plain at midnight, for he thought the king would be there at the coming dawn with his army, to fight. 
 <s n="390"/> He ordered Clearchos to lead the right wing, and Menon the Thessalian the left, 
 <s n="391"/> and he arranged his own troops himself.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.7.2">
 <s n="392"/> After the review, with the daylight, deserters came in from the Great King and reported to Cyros about the king’s army. 
 <s n="393"/> Cyros invited the captains and other officers of the Hellenes and held council on how he should arrange the battle, offering this cheering advice.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.3">
 <s n="394"/> “Gentlemen,” he said, “not for want of men have I brought you here as my allies, but I believe you to be better and stronger than large numbers of my own countrymen, and that is why I did it. 
 <s n="395"/> Show yourselves men, therefore, worthy of the freedom which you possess and which I envy. 
 <s n="396"/> Be sure I would give all I have and many times over if I could get that freedom.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.7.4">
 <s n="397"/> “But I understand what a contest you have before you, and I will tell you, that you may understand also. 
 <s n="398"/> The numbers are enormous, and they will come on with loud shouts and cries; but if you can stand that, I am ashamed to think what kind of men you will find in this country. 
 <s n="399"/> If you show yourselves men, and if all goes well with my part, I will arrange that any one of you who wishes to return home will be the envy of those he meets at home; 
 <s n="400"/> but I think I shall persuade many of you to choose what I have here rather than what he will find at home.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.5">
 <s n="401"/> Then Gaulites, a Samian exile who was present and a true friend of Cyros, said, 
 <s n="402"/> “Oh yes, Cyros, but some do say that you can promise great things now, because all this danger is threatening, but you will not remember if all goes well, so they say; 
 <s n="403"/> some say that even if you do remember, with the best of will you cannot pay all you promise.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.6">
 <s n="404"/> Cyros listened and said, “Well, gentlemen, my father’s empire reaches southwards as far as where it is too hot for men to live, 
 <s n="405"/> and northwards to where it is too cold; 
 <s n="406"/> all between is under the governance of my brother’s friends.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.7">
 <s n="407"/> “If we are victorious, I must make my friends masters of all this. 
 <s n="408"/> So I have no fear that I may not have something to give to each of my friends; what I fear is that there may not be friends enough. 
 <s n="409"/> And to each of you Hellenes, I will give a golden crown.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.8">
 <s n="410"/> On hearing this they were much more cheerful and eager themselves, 
 <s n="411"/> and they reported it to the others. Besides the Hellenic captains, many others paid Cyros a visit, asking what they would get if they won, 
 <s n="412"/> and he sent them all away satisfied.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.7.9">
 <s n="413"/> All that spoke with him begged him not to expose himself in the battle, but to take post behind themselves. 
 <s n="414"/> At this crisis Clearchos asked him once, “Do you really think he'll fight with you, Cyros, your own brother?” 
 <s n="415"/> “I’m sure he will,” said Cyros, “if he is really the son of Dareios and Parysatis, if he really is my brother— 
 <s n="416"/> not without a battle shall I win this prize.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.7.10">
 <s n="417"/> At the review the numbers were: Hellenes, shields 10,400; targeteers 2,500; national troops with Cyros, 100,000, and scythe-bearing chariots about 20.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.11">
 <s n="418"/> The enemy were said to be 1,200,000, with 200 scythe-bearing chariots. 
 <s n="419"/> There were 6,000 cavalry besides, under Artagerses; 
 <s n="420"/> these again were posted before the king himself.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.12">
 <s n="421"/> The royal army was commanded by four marshals or generals, each having 300,000 men under him—Abrocomas, Tissaphernes, Gobryas, and Arbaces. 
 <s n="422"/> But of these not all were present in the battle, only 900,000 men and 150 scythe-bearing chariots; 
 <s n="423"/> for Abrocomas came five days too late, having to march from Phoenicia.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.7.13">
 <s n="424"/> This was what the deserters reported to Cyros before the battle, and after the battle, those that were left of the enemy said the same.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.7.14">
 <s n="425"/> From this place Cyros marched one stage, 3 leagues, with the whole army in array both national and Hellenic, 
 <s n="426"/>for he thought the king would fight on that day. 
 <s n="427"/> Halfway through that stage, a deep trench had been dug, five fathoms across, three fathoms deep.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.7.15">
 <s n="428"/> The trench extended inland for twelve leagues over the plain as far as the wall of Media. 
 <s n="429"/> (Here are the canals bringing water from the River Tigris; 
 <s n="430"/>there are four, 100 feet wide and very deep, and barges of corn ply upon them; 
 <s n="431"/> they discharge into the Euphrates, and are one league apart, with bridges over them.) 
 <s n="432"/> Along the Euphrates was a narrow path, 20 feet in width, between the river and the end of the trench.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.7.16">
 <s n="433"/> This trench the Great King had made for a defense when he learned that Cyros was coming. 
 <s n="434"/> Cyros and his army now passed along this path, and so they came inside the trench.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.7.17">
 <s n="435"/> So on this day the king did not fight, but there were many tracks of men and horses retreating.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.7.18">
 <s n="436"/> Here Cyros called Silanos the Ambraciot seer and paid him 3,000 darics for his bet, because eleven days before he had declared at the sacrifice that the king would not fight within ten days, 
 <s n="437"/> and Cyros said, “Then he won’t fight at all if he does not fight within ten days; 
 <s n="438"/> and if your words come true, I promise you ten talents.” 
 <s n="439"/> So he paid him the money then, because ten days were past.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.7.19">
 <s n="440"/> But since here at the trench the king did not try to hinder the passage of Cyros and his army, both Cyros and the others believed he had given up the thought of fighting; 
 <s n="441"/> so the next day Cyros marched more carelessly.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.7.20">
 <s n="442"/> The day after, he was leading the way seated in his chariot, with a small body of men in front, while most of the army was in disorder, and the soldiers had left much of their heavy arms to be carried by wagons or pack animals.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.1">
 <s n="443"/> It was already about full-market time, <note>9 or 10 a.m.</note> and the stage where they were to rest was near, 
 when Pategyas, a trusty Persian from the staff of Cyros, suddenly appeared galloping on a sweating horse, 
 and shouted out straight to all he met, in Greek and Persian, that the king with a large army was coming prepared for battle.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.2">
 <s n="444"/> Then there was great confusion. 
 <s n="445"/> The Hellenes thought, and so did all, that they would be attacked on the spot in this disorder.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.3">
 <s n="446"/> Cyros leapt from his car and put on his corselet, and got on his horse, and took his lances in hand, 
 and sent word to all the rest to arm and take post every man.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.4">
 <s n="447"/> At once they fell in with all haste, Clearchos holding the right wing on the Euphrates River, Proxenos next, 
 and then the others, with Menon commanding the left wing of the Hellenic forces.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.5">
 <s n="448"/> Of the national troops, 1,000 Paphlagonian horsemen took stand by Clearchos on the right, 
 and the Hellenic targeteers; in the left wing, Ariaios, Cyros’s second-in-command, and the other nationals;
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.6">
 <s n="449"/> and Cyros with his 600 cavalry in the centre, all except Cyros being armed with corselets, thigh pieces, and helmets, 
 but Cyros went into battle with bare head—it is said that the Persians generally risk fighting with the head bare.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.7">
 <s n="450"/> All the horses wore protections on forehead and breast, 
 <s n="451"/> and the horsemen had Hellenic swords.
</section>



<section n="3" chapter="1.8.8">
 <s n="452"/> It was already midday, and the enemy had not appeared; 
 <s n="453"/> but when afternoon came dust appeared like a white cloud, and some time afterwards a sort of blackness spreading far over the plain. 
 <s n="454"/> But when they came nearer, quickly there were flashes of bronze and spears, and the lines were visible.
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="1.8.9">
 <s n="455"/> Cavalry in white corselets were on the enemy’s left wing; Tissaphernes was said to be in command of these. 
 <s n="456"/> Next came wicker-shieldmen, 
 <s n="457"/> next men-at-arms with wooden shields which reached to their feet—these were said to be Egyptians; 
 <s n="458"/> then more cavalry, bowmen too. 
 <s n="459"/> All these were arranged by nations, 
 <s n="460"/> each nation marching as a solid square of men.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.8.10">
 <s n="461"/> In front of all were the chariots, with large spaces between, those which are called scythe-bearers. 
 <s n="462"/> They had the scythes sticking out sideways from the axle-trees and under the cars pointing downwards, to cut through any they met. 
 <s n="463"/> The notion was to drive at the companies of Hellenes and cut them through.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.11">
 <s n="464"/> When Cyros had warned them not to mind the shouts and cries of the barbarians, he made a mistake; 
 <s n="465"/> there was no shouting, but they came on in deep silence, quietly in step, and slowly.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.12">
 <s n="466"/> At this moment, Cyros, riding past with Pigres the interpreter and three or four others, shouted out to Clearchos to lead his lines against the enemy centre, because the king was there: 
 <s n="467"/> “If we beat that,” he said, “we have won!”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.13">
 <s n="468"/> Clearchos eyed the mass in the middle, and learnt from Cyros that the king was outside in the Hellenic left (for the king so much exceeded in numbers that with his centre he overlapped Cyros’s left); he still was unwilling to break away the right wing from the river for fear he might be turned on both flanks, so he answered Cyros that he would take care that all went well.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.14">
 <s n="469"/> At this crisis the Persian army was advancing evenly, 
 <s n="470"/> but the Hellenic line was halted as the men kept coming up and forming. Cyros was riding some way off from his army, and looking keenly at each side, staring at the enemy and his own men.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.15">
 <s n="471"/> An Athenian, Xenophon, saw him and went out to him from the Hellenic line, and asked if he had any orders. 
 <s n="472"/> Cyros drew rein, and told him to spread the news everywhere that the omens from the sacrifice were all favourable.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="1.8.16">
 <s n="473"/> As he was speaking, he heard a confused noise running through the ranks, 
 <s n="474"/> and asked what the noise was. 
 <s n="475"/> The other said that the word of the day was being passed round for the second time. 
 <s n="476"/> Cyros wondered who gave the word, 
 <s n="477"/> and what it was.
</section>



<section n="3" chapter="1.8.17">
 <s n="478"/> He answered: “Zeus Saviour and Victory.” 
 <s n="479"/> Cyros said, “I accept the omen, so be it!” As he spoke he rode away to his own place. 
 <s n="480"/> The two lines were hardly six or seven hundred yards apart when the Hellenes began to chant the battle hymn and moved against the enemy.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.8.18">
 <s n="481"/> Part of the line billowed out as they moved, and the slower part began to double up; 
 <s n="482"/> then all together broke into a ringing cheer, “Eleleu, eleleu!” and all charged at the double. 
 <s n="483"/> Some say they also beat the spears on the shields to scare the horses.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.19">
 <s n="484"/> Before one shot reached them, the barbarians turned and fled. 
 <s n="485"/> At once the Hellenes pursued with might and main, but shouted to each other, “Don’t run races! Keep your line!”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.8.20">
 <s n="486"/> The chariots ran away without drivers, some through their own people, some through the Hellenes: these saw them coming, and gave them room. 
 <s n="487"/> One man was caught as he stood like someone dazed in the middle of a racecourse; 
 <s n="488"/> even this fellow had no hurt, so they said, 
 <s n="489"/> and not one other Hellene was hurt in this battle, except one on the left wing, said to have been shot by an arrow.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.21">
 <s n="490"/> Cyros was delighted when he saw the Hellenes victorious in their part and pursuing; he was greeted as king already by those about him, but even so he was not induced to join the pursuit. 
 <s n="491"/> He kept his own body of 600 horse in close order, and watched to see what the king would do. He knew of course that the king held the centre of the Persian army.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.22">
 <s n="492"/> Indeed all the generals of these barbarian nations hold the centre when they command; they consider it to be safest when their force is on both sides, and if they need to send dispatches, the army knows in half the time.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.23">
 <s n="493"/> So the king was then holding the centre of his army, and still overlapping the left wing of Cyros. 
 <s n="494"/> Since there was no enemy in front, and none against the troops drawn up before him, he wheeled round to encircle Cyros.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.24">
 <s n="495"/> Then Cyros, fearing he might get behind and cut up the Hellenic force, charged at him; 
 <s n="496"/> with his 600 he fell on the troops posted in front of the king, and put the 6,000 men to flight, and it is said killed with his own hand their commander Artagerses.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.25">
 <s n="497"/> When those were routed, Cyros’s 600 were broken up in the pursuit, except a very few left about him, hardly more than his table-companions, as they were called.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.8.26">
 <s n="498"/> Left with these, he caught sight of the king and the bodyguard round him; 
 <s n="499"/> then he could hold himself no longer, but charged at him, saying, “I see the man!” and struck him on the breast and wounded him through his corselet, as the doctor Ctesias reports, who says he cured the wound.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.8.27">
 <s n="500"/> As he struck, someone struck Cyros with a lance violently under the eye; 
 <s n="501"/> and there as they fought, the king and Cyros and the others about each, how many fell of the king’s party Ctesias tells, for he was in attendance; 
 <s n="502"/> and Cyros himself was killed, 
 <s n="503"/> and eight of the most noble about him lay dead over his body.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.8.28">
 <s n="504"/> It is said that Artapates, who was the most trusted of all his wandholders, when he saw Cyros fallen leaped off his horse and threw himself on the body.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.8.29">
 <s n="505"/> Some say the king told a man to cut his throat over the body, 
 <s n="506"/> some that he killed himself with his own scimitar—he had a golden scimitar, 
 <s n="507"/> and he wore bracelets and armlets and the other ornaments of the noblest Persians; 
 <s n="508"/> for he was highly honoured by Cyros for loyalty and trustworthiness.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.1">
 <s n="509"/> So died Cyros; of all Persians that came after the first Cyros, the most royal and most worthy to be king, as all agree who are reputed to have known Cyros themselves.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.2">
 <s n="510"/> To begin with, when he was still a boy, and being educated along with his brother and the other boys, he was considered best of them all in everything.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.3">
 <s n="511"/> For all the sons of the noblest Persians are educated at the king’s door; 
 <s n="512"/> there one may learn many a lesson in good manners, but nothing ugly can be heard or seen there.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.4">
 <s n="513"/> They see and hear when honour is done to any by the king, and when others are disgraced; 
 <s n="514"/> so from boyhood they learn both to rule and to be ruled.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.5">
 <s n="515"/> There Cyros was thought to be the most modest of all his agemates, obeying his elders better than his own inferiors did. 
 <s n="516"/> Next, he was the greatest lover of horses, and knew best how to manage them; and in war-like accomplishments, in archery and casting the javelin, they judged him the most eager to learn and the most careful to practise.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.6">
 <s n="517"/> Again when he was old enough, he was most fond of hunting, ay and most ready to face danger among wild beasts. 
 <s n="518"/> When a bear charged him once he did not shrink, but grappled with her; he was dragged off his horse, and received wounds which left their scars on him, but killed her at last; 
 <s n="519"/> and he richly rewarded the first man who came to help.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.7">
 <s n="520"/> Then he was sent down country as governor of Lydia and great Phrygia and Cappadocia, and appointed commander-in-chief of all the forces which had to assemble in the plain of Castolos. In this the first thing he made clear was, that if ever he made a truce or bargain or promise he never broke it.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.8">
 <s n="521"/> Indeed the cities put into his care all trusted him, and the men trusted him; 
 <s n="522"/> and if anyone was an enemy, truce once made he trusted that nothing would be done to him contrary to that truce.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.9">
 <s n="523"/> Accordingly when he made war against Tissaphernes, all the cities willingly chose Cyros instead of Tissaphernes, except Miletos; 
 <s n="524"/> and there the people feared him because he would not abandon their banished men.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.10">
 <s n="525"/> For he said, and he proved by his acts, that he never would abandon them when once he had become their friend, not even if they lost numbers and lost luck.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.11">
 <s n="526"/> If anyone did either evil or good to him, he tried to outdo them, and made that quite clear. 
 <s n="527"/> Some said that his common prayer was, “May I live as long as I can go one better with friends and foes!”
</section>


<section n="1" chapter="1.9.12">
 <s n="528"/> Indeed there was no man alive in our time who found so many others eager to grant him money and city and even their own bodies.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.13">
 <s n="529"/> To be sure, no-one could say that he allowed any to do harm or wrong and then laugh in his face; 
 <s n="530"/> he punished quite without mercy, and you could often see by the highroads persons lacking feet or hands or eyes. 
 <s n="531"/> The result was that in Cyros’s province a man might travel fearlessly where he would, whether Hellene or Asiatic, and carry whatever suited him, so long as he did no wrong.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.14">
 <s n="532"/> Moreover, those who were good men in war he rewarded notably, as all agreed. 
 <s n="533"/> For example, he had a war against the Pisidians and Mysians. 
 <s n="534"/> He took the field himself against these countries; and when he saw men ready to take risks, he made these governors of the places he conquered, and rewarded them besides.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.15">
 <s n="535"/> And so these were seen to prosper exceedingly, and the cowards were thought fit to be their slaves.
 <s n="536"/> Therefore he found plenty of volunteers in any risk, when they thought Cyros would see.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.16">
 <s n="537"/> In justice and honesty, if anyone showed himself glad to display these virtues, he took good care to make these richer than those who were greedy for unjust advantage.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.17">
 <s n="538"/> All his dealings were just, indeed, but he was especially particular to have a real army. 
 <s n="539"/> Thus the captains and officers from abroad who served him for pay understood that to serve Cyros well was worth more to them than so much a month.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.18">
 <s n="540"/> Besides this, if anyone did serve him well, he never left willing service unrewarded. 
 <s n="541"/> Accordingly Cyros always found, as they said, the best men to carry out any enterprise.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.19">
 <s n="542"/> If he saw one a skilful and just administrator, who managed his district well and collected the revenues, he never deprived him but always added to his trust; 
 <s n="543"/> so men worked willingly, and got wealth boldly, and never tried to hide from Cyros what they got. 
 <s n="544"/> He showed himself not one to envy those who were openly rich, but hidden riches he tried to bring into use.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.20">
 <s n="545"/> Friends again, if he made any and found them loyal, and judged them capable assistants in what he wanted to do, he treated well, no man better, as all agree.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.21">
 <s n="546"/> For just as he wanted friends to help in each undertaking, so he tried his best to help these friends in anything which he saw they wanted.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.22">
 <s n="547"/> More gifts were offered to him, I believe, than to any other man who ever lived, for many reasons; 
 <s n="548"/> and no-one was ever more ready to distribute these among his friends, while he considered their tastes to see what each wanted most.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.23">
 <s n="549"/> When the gifts were meant for his person, whether in battle or just as finery, he used to say, “I can’t deck out my body in all this finery, but a man’s best finery is when his friends go fine.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.24">
 <s n="550"/> In great things it is no wonder he could outdo his generous friends, since he had greater power; 
 <s n="551"/> but he took care to have the better of them in little attentions and graces, which appears to me more admirable still.
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="1.9.25">
 <s n="552"/> When he received some specially good wine, he would often send a keg half full to a friend, with a message, “I haven't drunk such good wine for a long time, 
 <s n="553"/> so I send you this. Please drink it up to-day with your best friends!”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.26">
 <s n="554"/> Often he would send half a goose or half a cake, and things like that, telling his bearer to say, 
 <s n="555"/>“Cyros liked this, 
 <s n="556"/>and he wants you to have a taste.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.27">
 <s n="557"/> When hay was hard to get and he had plenty himself because he had provided it, and there were many servants, he would send round to tell his friends to stuff the horses they rode with this, that they might not starve while they carried his friends about.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.9.28">
 <s n="558"/> If he ever went on progress and crowds came to see him, he would call up friends and talk seriously to them, to show whom he valued.
 <s n="559"/> So from all I hear, I judge that no-one has ever been better loved by Hellenes and Asiatics alike.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.9.29">
 <s n="560"/> So from all I hear, I judge that no-one has ever been better loved by Hellenes and Asiatics alike. Here is another proof.
 <s n="561"/> When Cyros was the king's slave, no-one ever left him for the king, only Orontas tried.
 <s n="562"/> Indeed the king himself found that the man he thought faithful to himself was a better friend to Cyros.
 <s n="563"/> But from the king, many did come away to Cyros after they became enemies, and those more over whom the king cared for most—they thought that with Cyros if they played their parts well they would receive a worthier return than with the king.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.9.30">
 <s n="564"/> A great proof again is what happened at the end of his life, to show that he was noble himself, and knew how to judge rightly the trusty and loyal and firm.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.9.31">
 <s n="565"/> For when he died all his friends and table companions died fighting over him, except Ariaios, 
 <s n="566"/> who was posted on the left wing, as it happened, in command of the cavalry.
 <s n="567"/> When he perceived that Cyros was dead he escaped with all his command.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.10.1">
 <s n="568"/> Then the head and right hand of Cyros were cut off.
 <s n="569"/> The king, pursuing, fell on Cyros’s camp.
 <s n="570"/> Those with Ariaios did not stand, but escaped through their own camp to the stage-house where they had come from.
 <s n="571"/> The distance was said to be four leagues.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.2">
 <s n="572"/> The king and his troops plundered the camp, and took a great spoil, including the Phocaian mistress of Cyros, famous as “the clever and beautiful.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.10.3">
 <s n="573"/> The Milesian, who was younger, was caught by the king’s men, but she slipt out of her robe, and escaped to a body of Hellenes who happened to be on guard among the baggage animals.
 <s n="574"/> They resisted the plunderers and killed many of them, and of themselves some were killed, too, yet they did not take flight, but they saved the woman and everything else that was in their charge, goods and men.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.4">
 <s n="575"/> At this time the king and the Hellenes were three or four miles apart, the Hellenes pursuing and believing they were victorious everywhere, the others plundering and believing they were victorious themselves.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.5">
 <s n="576"/> But when the Hellenes perceived that the king and his army were in their camp, and when the king heard from Tissaphernes that the Hellenes were victors on their part and far away in pursuit, at once the king collected his forces and put them in order.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.10.6">
 <s n="577"/> Meanwhile the king showed himself advancing from the rear, as it seemed. 
 <s n="578"/> The Hellenes turned and prepared to receive his attack on the spot, but the king did not approach them; he passed them by the way he had come, outside what had been their left wing, catching up those who had deserted to the Hellenes in the battle, and also Tissaphernes with his division.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.10.7">
 <s n="579"/> For Tissaphernes when they first met had not taken flight, but he rode along the river through the Hellenic targeteers.
 <s n="580"/> He killed none in passing through, but the Hellenes made room and struck at them and volleyed as they went.
 <s n="581"/> Episthenes of Amphipolis was in command, said to be a capable officer.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.8">
 <s n="582"/> Tissaphernes then got rather the worst of it but came out clear; he did not turn back, but went as far as to the Hellenic camp, and there found the king, when they put their forces together again and went on.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.10.9">
 <s n="583"/> When they came to the Hellenic left wing the Hellenes were afraid they might attack and surround them and cut them to pieces, 
 <s n="584"/>and they decided to extend their line and put the river behind them.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.10.10">
 <s n="585"/> While they were discussing this, lo and behold the king passed them, and placed his line opposite them in the same position as he was in at the beginning of the battle.
 <s n="586"/> When the Hellenes saw them near, and drawn up opposite, they chanted the battle-hymn again and charged much more vigorously than before.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.11">
 <s n="587"/> Again the barbarians would not stand, but ran even sooner than before.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.10.12">
 <s n="588"/> The Hellenes pursued them as far as some village, 
 <s n="589"/> and there they halted; 
 <s n="590"/> for above the village was a mound, on which the king’s party rallied, only cavalry now, but they covered the mound so that no-one could see what happened. 
 <s n="591"/> But they said they did see the royal standard, a golden eagle, stretched across a shield and held up on a pole.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.10.13">
 <s n="592"/> As soon as the Hellenes moved again the horsemen at once left the mound, 
 <s n="593"/> not all together but in small parties; 
 <s n="594"/> the mound became bare by degrees, 
 <s n="595"/> and at last they were all gone.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.14">
 <s n="596"/> Clearchos did not take his army upon the mound, but halted them at the foot, and sent up Lycios the Syracusan and one other to report what there was on the other side.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="1.10.15">
 <s n="597"/> Lycios rode up, and reported that they were all going as fast as they could.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.10.16">
 <s n="598"/> Just then the sun set, 
 <s n="599"/> the Hellenes halted and ordered arms, and rested, 
 <s n="600"/> wondering why Cyros was nowhere to be seen and no messages came from him. 
 <s n="601"/> For they did not know he was dead, but they supposed he was in pursuit, or gone forward to occupy some place.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="1.10.17">
 <s n="602"/>They deliberated whether they should stay there and bring up the baggage, or go back to camp.
 <s n="603"/>They decided to go back, 
 <s n="604"/> and they reached the tents about supper-time.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="1.10.18">
 <s n="605"/>This was the end of that day.
 <s n="606"/>They found most of their goods plundered, and all the food and drink gone; even the wagons loaded with barley and wine which Cyros had provided to distribute if the army were in special need (400 wagons, it was said), even these the king’s army had spoiled.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="1.10.19">
 <s n="607"/>So most of the Hellenes had no dinner, 
 <s n="608"/> and they had not had breakfast either; 
 <s n="609"/> for the king appeared before the army was dismissed for breakfast.
 <s n="610"/>So they passed that night.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.1.1">
<s n="611"/> <note n="no translation"/>
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.1.2">
 <s n="612"/>At daybreak the captains met. They were surprised that Cyros had neither appeared himself, nor sent someone to tell them what to do.
 <s n="613"/>They decided, therefore, to collect what they had, and to get under arms, and to go on till they found him.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.1.3">
 <s n="614"/>As they were just starting, at sunrise, up came Procles, the governor of Teuthrania, a man descended from Damaratos the Laconian, and with him Glûs, the son of Tamó.
 <s n="615"/>These told them that Cyros was dead, but Ariaios had escaped, and was with the other Asiatics in the stagehouse from which they marched on the day before; he said he would wait that day for them, if they would come, but on the morrow he was going back to Ionia, where he came from.
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="2.1.4">
 <s n="616"/>When they heard this the captains were very much distressed, and so were the other Hellenes.
 <s n="617"/>Clearchos said, 
 <s n="618"/> “If only Cyros were alive!
 <s n="619"/>But pray report to Ariaios, that we are victorious over the king, and, as you see, no-one is left here to fight us; 
 <s n="620"/> if you had not come, we should be on the march against the king now.
 <s n="621"/>We say to Ariaios that if he will come here, we will place him on the royal throne; for the kingdom belongs to the conquerors.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.1.5">
 <s n="622"/>With these words he sent the messengers away, and with them Cheirisophos the Laconian and Menon the Thessalian; 
 <s n="623"/> Menon himself wished it, 
 <s n="624"/> for he was a guest-friend of Ariaios.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.1.6">
 <s n="625"/>So they went, and Clearchos remained.
 <s n="626"/>The army prepared food as well as they could, butchering the cattle and asses of the baggage train; 
 <s n="627"/>they got wood by going a little in front of their lines, where they found plenty of arrows on the battlefield, which they had forced the deserters from the king to throw away, and the shields of wickerwork and Egyptian wooden shields.
 <s n="628"/>There were plenty of bucklers, too, and empty wagons which they could carry off.
 <s n="629"/>They used all these to boil the meat which they ate that day.
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="2.1.7">
 <s n="630"/>It was already about full-market time when messengers came from the king, heralds of the country, and one Hellene among them, Phalinos, who happened to be with Tissaphernes and highly respected;
 <s n="631"/>for he claimed to be expert in tactics and fighting in arms.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.1.8">
 <s n="632"/>These came and summoned the captains, and said, “The king having killed Cyros and won the victory, commands the Hellenes to lay down their arms, and find at the king’s door what good they can.”
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="2.1.9">
 <s n="633"/>Such was the king’s message.
 <s n="634"/>The Hellenes were very angry, but Clearchos only said, “It is not for victors to lay down their arms.”
 <s n="635"/>Then to the other captains, “You, my fellow-captains, answer these gentlemen as you think fairest and best; 
 <s n="636"/> I will be here in a moment,”
 <s n="637"/>for a servant had just called him to see the sacred parts which had been taken out from a victim 
 <s n="638"/> which was being sacrificed.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.1.10">
 <s n="639"/>Then Cleanor the Arcadian, eldest of them, said they would die sooner than lay down their arms;
 <s n="640"/>and Proxenos the Theban said, “I wonder, Phalinos, whether the king speaks as conqueror or asks our arms as a friendly gift.
 <s n="641"/>If as conqueror, why does not he come and take them?
 <s n="642"/>If he wants us to yield them willingly, let him tell us what the soldiers will have left, if they make him a present of these?”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.1.11">
 <s n="643"/>Phalinos answered, 
 <s n="644"/> “The king considers he is victor, since he has killed Cyros.
 <s n="645"/>For who is there who will challenge him for his empire?
 <s n="646"/>He considers that you also are his, because he holds you in the midst of his country, surrounded by impassable rivers, and he can bring against you such a multitude of men as you could not kill if you had the chance.”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.1.12">
 <s n="647"/>Theopompos the Athenian followed and said,
 <s n="648"/> “My dear Phalinos, we have nothing good here, as you see, except arms and courage.
 <s n="649"/>While we keep our arms, we think we can use our courage; 
 <s n="650"/> but if we give them up, we shall lose our lives too.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.1.13">
 <s n="651"/>Hearing this, Phalinos laughed, and said, 
  <s n="652"/> “Why, you are quite a philosopher, young man, you speak neatly;
 <s n="653"/>but let me tell you that you are foolish if you think your courage can overcome the king’s power. The king’s strength is too great for your bravery to prevail.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.1.14">
 <s n="654"/>A few others, it is reported, showed a little weakness, and said they had been faithful to Cyros, and the king might find them valuable if he liked to be their friend;
 <s n="655"/>he might use them for a campaign into Egypt or something else, and they would go.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.1.15">
 <s n="656"/>At this moment Clearchos returned and asked whether they had given their answer.
 <s n="657"/> Phalinos broke in, and said, 
 <s n="658"/> “These people say all sorts of things, Clearchos;
 
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.1.16">
<s n="659"/>tell us what you say.”
 <s n="660"/>He answered, 
 <s n="661"/> “I was glad to see you, Phalinos, and so were the others, I think;
 <s n="662"/>you are a Hellene, and so are we, every one of us that you see before you.
 <s n="663"/>In our present case we ask your advice as to what we ought to do.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.1.17">
 <s n="664"/>Advise us in God’s name what you think fairest and best, something that will do you honour when it is reported in time to come: how Phalinos was once sent by the king to command Hellenes to lay down their arms, and they asked his advice, and this was his advice.
 <s n="665"/>You know it is inevitable, that whatever you advise will be told all over Hellas.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.1.18">
 <s n="666"/>Clearchos gave these hints hoping that the king’s ambassador might advise them himself not to lay down their arms, and then the others would be more confident.
 <s n="667"/>But Phalinos did the opposite; he turned round, and said,
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.1.19">
 <s n="668"/>“This is my advice. If you have one hope in ten thousand to make war against the king, and to save your lives, do not lay down your arms.
 <s n="669"/>But if there is no hope whatever of safety against the king’s wish, I advise you to save yourselves in the one way you can.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.1.20">
 <s n="670"/>Clearchos answered to this, “Very well, that is what you say: from us take this answer.
 <s n="671"/>We believe that if we are to be friends to the king, we should be more valuable friends with arms than without;
 <s n="672"/>and if we are to make war, it is better to make war with arms than without.”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.1.21">
 <s n="673"/>Phalinos said, 
 <s n="674"/> “We will take back this answer; let me say that the king added, that there shall be a truce if you stay where you are, but if you move forwards or move backwards, war.
 <s n="675"/>Answer this too, then: will you stay, and is there a truce?
 <s n="676"/>Or shall I report that there is war?”
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="2.1.22">
 <s n="677"/>“Report then," said Clearchus, "that our view is the same as the king’s.”
 <s n="678"/>“What does that mean?” said Phalinos.
 <s n="679"/>Clearchos answered, 
 <s n="680"/> “If we stay where we are, a truce;
 <s n="681"/>“If we stay where we are, a truce;
 <s n="682"/>if we move forwards or backwards, war.”
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.1.23">
 <s n="683"/>He asked again, 
 <s n="684"/> “Truce or war, which?”
 <s n="685"/>Clearchos made the same answer again, 
 <s n="686"/>“Truce if we stay here, war if we move forwards or backwards.”
 <s n="687"/>But he did not indicate which he meant to do.
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="2.2.1">
 <s n="688"/>So Phalinos departed and those with him.
 <s n="689"/>Then Procles and Cheirisophos returned from Ariaios, 
 <s n="690"/> but Menon stayed with him.
 <s n="691"/>These reported that Ariaios said there were many Persians better than himself who would never let him be king;
 <s n="692"/>“but if you wish to go away with him, he tells you to come to-night.
 <s n="693"/>Otherwise, he says he will go early in the morning.”
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.2.2">
 <s n="694"/>Clearchos said, 
 <s n="695"/> “Very good, so be it.
 <s n="696"/>If we come, then as you say;
 <s n="697"/>if not, do whatever you think most profitable for yourselves.”
 <s n="698"/>But he did not tell these either what he meant to do.
</section>

<section n="8" chapter="2.2.3">
 <s n="699"/>After this, when the sun was already sinking, he called the captains and other officers together, and spoke to them.
 <s n="700"/>“Gentlemen,” he said, “I sacrifice for advance against the king, and the omens were not favourable.
 <s n="701"/>There is perhaps nothing strange in that;
 <s n="702"/> for between us and the king is the Tigris, a navigable river which we could not cross without boats, 
 <s n="703"/> and boats we have none.
 <s n="704"/>However, we cannot stay where we are, 
 <s n="705"/> for we cannot get provisions.
 <s n="706"/>But for going to the friends of Cyros the omens were completely favourable.”
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.2.4">
 <s n="707"/>“This is what we must do.
 <s n="708"/>Dismiss, and dine on what we can find:
 <s n="709"/>when the first horn sounds for turning in, pack up;
 <s n="710"/>at the second, put the stuff on the animals;
 <s n="711"/>at the third, follow your guide, keeping the animals next to the river, and the shields outside.”
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="2.2.5">
 <s n="712"/>The captains and officers did so;
 <s n="713"/>and for the rest, he led and they followed—not that they chose him, but they saw that he alone understood what the leader ought to do, and the others were inexperienced.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.2.6">
 <s n="714"/>The march from Ephesus in Ionia to the battlefield was 93 stages, 535 parasangs, 10,620 stadia;
 <s n="715"/>and from the battlefield to Babylon was said to be 360 stadia.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.2.7">
 <s n="716"/>After this, when darkness came, Miltocythes the Thracian deserted to the king, taking with him his horsemen, forty in number, and some three hundred of the Thracian footmen.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.2.8">
 <s n="717"/>Clearchos led the others as he had told them, and they followed,
 <s n="718"/>and they reached Ariaios and his force at the first stage-house, about midnight.
 <s n="719"/>They grounded arms in their ranks; and there was a meeting of the captains and other officers with Ariaios.
 <s n="720"/>The Hellenes and Ariaios and the chief of those with him swore to be allies and to be faithful to one another;
 <s n="721"/>the nationals also swore to lead the way honestly.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.2.9">
 <s n="722"/>This they swore, cutting the throats of a bull and a boar and a ram over a shield: the Hellenes dipt a sword in the blood, the Asiatics a spear.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.2.10">
 <s n="723"/>When the oath had been taken, Clearchos said: “Now then, Ariaios, since the same journey is before us all, tell me what notion you have of the road.
 <s n="724"/>Are we to return the same way as we came, or have you thought of another that seems better?”
</section>


<section n="6" chapter="2.2.11">
 <s n="725"/>He said, 
 <s n="726"/> “If we go back by the way we came, we should perish of hunger outright;
 <s n="727"/>for we have no provisions now.
 <s n="728"/>Even on our way here we got nothing at all from the country on the seventeen last stages;
 <s n="729"/>where there was anything we have used it all up on the march already.
 <s n="730"/>The way we think of taking now is longer, but there will be no lack of provisions.”
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="2.2.12">
 <s n="731"/>“We must make the first stages as long as we can, that we may get away from the royal army as far as we can;
 <s n="732"/>for if once we can put two or three days’ journey between us, the king will never be able to catch us.
 <s n="733"/>With a small force he will not dare to follow;
 <s n="734"/>with a large force he will not be able to go fast,
 <s n="735"/>perhaps he will even fall short of provisions.
 <s n="736"/>That’s my opinion,” he said.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.2.13">
 <s n="737"/>This plan of campaign meant nothing more than to cut and run;
 <s n="738"/>but fortune planned better.
 <s n="739"/>When day came, they marched with the sun on their right hand, calculating that by sunset they would reach villages in the Babylonian country;
 <s n="740"/>and in this they were not deceived.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.2.14">
 <s n="741"/>But while it was still afternoon they thought they saw enemy horsemen;
 <s n="742"/>and those of the Hellenes who were not in their ranks fell in, and Ariaios (who was travelling in a wagon because he had been wounded) got down and put on his corselet, and so did those with him.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.2.15">
 <s n="743"/>While they were arming, their scouts came back reporting they were not cavalrymen but pack-animals grazing.
 <s n="744"/>And they soon understood that the king was encamped somewhere near,
 <s n="745"/>for smoke was seen in villages not far off.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.2.16">
 <s n="746"/>Clearchos did not lead against the enemy, for he knew that the men were weary and hungry, and it was late already;
 <s n="747"/>yet he kept straight on without swerving, for he would not let them think he was running away,
 <s n="748"/>and at sunset he brought up his van to the nearest villages and encamped.
 <s n="749"/>From these everything had been stripped by the royal army, down to the woodwork of the cottages.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.2.17">
 <s n="750"/>However, the first men encamped after a fashion, and those behind coming along in the dark lay in the open as it chanced, and they made a great noise calling to one another, so that even the enemy heard;
 <s n="751"/>and the nearest of the enemy even fled out of their encampment.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.2.18">
 <s n="752"/>This became clear next day;
 <s n="753"/>for not an animal was to be seen, no camp, no smoke anywhere near.
 <s n="754"/>The king himself was frightened, as it seemed, at the army’s approach,
 <s n="755"/>as he made clear by what he did the day after.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.2.19">
 <s n="756"/>However, as the night went on a panic fell on the Hellenes also and there was din and disturbance as one might expect in a panic.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.2.20">
 <s n="757"/>Clearchos sent round Tolmides the Elean, the herald who was with him as it happened, the best herald of his time; he was to call for silence, and proclaim from headquarters, one talent reward for information who let the ass loose in the camp.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.2.21">
 <s n="758"/>When this was proclaimed, the men knew that it was an empty panic and the commanders were safe and sound.
 <s n="759"/>At break of day Clearchos ordered the Hellenes to form in line in the same position which they had in the battle.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.1">
 <s n="760"/>It was clear now that the king had been terrified by their approach, as I wrote above;
 <s n="761"/>for the day before he had commanded them to lay down their arms, but now at sunrise he sent heralds to treat for a truce.
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="2.3.2">
 <s n="762"/>When they reached the outposts, these went in search of their commanders;
 <s n="763"/>and Clearchos, who happened to be then reviewing the lines, heard the report of the outposts, and sent back word that the heralds were to wait until he had leisure.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.3.3">
 <s n="764"/>When he had arranged his army so that a solid array could be easily seen everywhere, with no-one visible outside the forces, he summoned the mission,
 <s n="765"/>and went to meet them with the best-armed and finest men he had, and told the other captains to do the same.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.4">
 <s n="766"/>When he came up to the mission, he asked what they wanted.
 <s n="767"/>They answered that they came to arrange a truce, with full powers from the king to treat with the Hellenes, and to report their proposals to the king.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.5">
 <s n="768"/>Clearchos then said, “Report to him, then, that first there must be battle;
 <s n="769"/>we have no breakfast, and no man shall dare to speak of truce to Hellenes without providing breakfast.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.6">
 <s n="770"/>When the embassy heard this, they rode away, and soon came back;
 <s n="771"/>so it was plain that the king was somewhere near, or someone whose duty it was to arrange things.
 <s n="772"/>They said that the king thought it a reasonable request, and they had brought guides to take them where they would find breakfast, if they could arrange a truce.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.7">
 <s n="773"/>Clearchos asked whether the truce was offered just for the men as they went and came back, or was it a general truce for all.
 <s n="774"/>They replied, “For all, until we give our report to the king.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.8">
 <s n="775"/>When they had finished, Clearchos removed them and held council;
 <s n="776"/>and it seemed best to accept this truce and quietly to go and get the provisions.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.3.9">
 <s n="777"/>So he said, “I agree with that, but I will not tell them at once;
 <s n="778"/>I will delay until the ambassadors are anxious for fear we may refuse to make truce.
 <s n="779"/>I think, however,” he said, “that our own men will fear the same!”
 <s n="780"/>When he thought it was the right time, he announced that he would make truce,
 <s n="781"/>and bade them lead him at once to the provisions.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.10">
 <s n="782"/>So they did; but Clearchos, although he had made the truce, marched with the army in battle order, himself commanding the rearguard.
 <s n="783"/>They came on ditches and canals full of water, which they could not cross without bridges;
 <s n="784"/>but they managed by making bridges of fallen date-palms or others which they cut down.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.11">
 <s n="785"/>Then one could learn what a commander Clearchos was.
 <s n="786"/>In his left hand he held the spear, a stick in his right; and if he thought there was any shirking, he picked out the right man and gave him one,
 <s n="787"/>and also he lent a hand himself, jumping into the mud, so that all were ashamed not to work as hard as he did.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.12">
 <s n="788"/>Those of thirty years and under were told off for this job;
 <s n="789"/>but when they saw how keen Clearchos was, the older men helped.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.3.13">
 <s n="790"/>What made him more anxious was that he suspected the ditches were not always so full of water, for it was not the season for watering the plain; he thought the king might have let in this water on purpose to show them how many dangers they would meet on the march.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.14">
 <s n="791"/>At last they reached villages from which the guides directed them to take the provisions.
 <s n="792"/>There was plenty of corn and date-wine and a sour drink made by boiling dates.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.15">
 <s n="793"/>The palm-nuts or date-nuts which we see in our country are such as were kept for servants;
 <s n="794"/>but those reserved for the masters were select, wonderfully fine and large, just like amber in colour: and some they dry and store for delicacies.
 <s n="795"/>These were delicious as a relish for wine, but they give headache.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.16">
 <s n="796"/>That was the first time the men tasted the brain or top-cabbage of the palm, and most of them were surprised at the shape and peculiar flavour.
 <s n="797"/>This also was very apt to give headache.
 <s n="798"/>When the brain was taken from the palm, the whole tree withered.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.3.17">
 <s n="799"/>There they remained three days.
 <s n="800"/>Then arrived Tissaphernes, and the queen’s brother, and three other Persians, with a long train of slaves.
 <s n="801"/>When the Hellenic captains met them, Tissaphernes first spoke through an interpreter.
 <s n="802"/>He said:
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.18">
 <s n="803"/>“I am a near neighbour to Hellas, gentlemen; and when I saw you follow into danger and difficulty, I thought it a grand opportunity if I could persuade the king as a favour to let me bring you back safe to Hellas;
 <s n="804"/>for I think that would earn me your thanks and your country’s.
</section>






<section n="2" chapter="2.3.19">
 <s n="805"/>With this intention I put my petition before the king, saying that he might fairly gratify me because I first told him that Cyros was advancing against him, and I brought him aid along with my news;
 <s n="806"/>and I alone of all those who faced the Hellenes did not take to flight, but I rode through and joined the king in your camp which he had then reached, after killing Cyros and pursuing the nationals with Cyros along with the forces which are with me now, the most loyal of all his men. He promised me that he would consider this;
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.3.20">
 <s n="807"/>but he told me to come and ask why you made war upon him.
 <s n="808"/>And I advise you to answer moderately that it may be easier for me to find how I may arrange something good for you.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.21">
 <s n="809"/>The Hellenes retired and consulted what to say;
 <s n="810"/>and they answered, Clearchos being spokesman:
 <s n="811"/>“We did not assemble to make war on the king, nor did we march against the king; but Cyros found many excuses, as you know well yourself, that he might catch you unprepared and bring us here.”
</section>



<section n="1" chapter="2.3.22">
 <s n="812"/>However, when we saw him in danger, we were really ashamed before gods and men to desert him, after offering ourselves to him long since for his service.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.23">
 <s n="813"/>But now that Cyros is dead, we do not lay claim to the king’s empire, and there is no reason why we should damage the king’s country or wish to kill the king himself.
 <s n="814"/>We wish to march home, if no-one molests us; but if we are injured we shall try to defend ourselves, with God’s help.
 <s n="815"/>If moreover, anyone turns up to help us, we shall be no less ready to help him as far as we can.”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.3.24">
 <s n="816"/>Tissaphernes listened to him, and said, 
 <s n="817"/> “I will report this to the king, and bring back his answer.
 <s n="818"/>Until I return let the truce be kept, 
 <s n="819"/>and I will provide you a market.”
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.25">
 <s n="820"/>Next day he did not return, 
 <s n="821"/> and the Hellenes were anxious;
 <s n="822"/>but he came the day after, and said he had procured from the king the boon of safety for the Hellenes, although many had urged that it was unworthy for the king to let go those who had made war against him.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.26">
 <s n="823"/>At the end he said, 
 <s n="824"/> “Now you may receive our promise to keep the country at peace with you, and to take you back to Hellas without fraud;
 <s n="825"/>we will provide a market, and wherever you cannot buy, we will allow you to take what is necessary from the country.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.3.27">
 <s n="826"/>“You on your part must take your oath to march as through a friendly country, only taking food and drink without violence whenever we do not provide a market, but when we do you must buy provisions.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.3.28">
 <s n="827"/>This was agreed; they took the oath, and Tissaphernes and the queen’s brother gave their right hands to the captains and officers of the Hellenes, and these did the like.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.3.29">
 <s n="828"/>After this Tissaphernes said, 
 <s n="829"/>“Now, then, I return to the king;
 <s n="830"/>when I have arranged what I wish, I will come back ready to conduct you to Hellas, and myself to return to my province.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.1">
 <s n="831"/>After this the Hellenes and Ariaios waited for Tissaphernes, encamped near each other, for more than twenty days.
 <s n="832"/>Meanwhile Ariaios was visited by brothers and other relations, and some of his people had visits from Persians, who encouraged them, and brought pledges to some from the king, that the king would bear no malice against them for their campaign with Cyros or for anything else now bygone.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.2">
 <s n="833"/>While this went on Ariaios’s people clearly began to think less about the Hellenes.
 <s n="834"/>So for this reason they displeased many of the Hellenes; and these complained to Clearchos and the other captains, and said:
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.4.3">
 <s n="835"/>“What are we waiting for?
 <s n="836"/>Don’t we know that the king would give anything to destroy us, and show our whole nation what a terror it is to make war on the Great King?
 <s n="837"/>Now he deludes us to stay because his army is scattered;
 <s n="838"/>but when the whole army is assembled again there is no doubt he will attack us.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.4">
 <s n="839"/>“Perhaps they are digging somewhere or fortifying somewhere to make the road impassable.
 <s n="840"/>He will never be willing, if he can help it, that we shall go back to Hellas and report that a few men like us beat the king in front of his own door, and got away to laugh at him.”
</section>

<section n="7" chapter="2.4.5">
 <s n="841"/>Clearchos answered, 
 <s n="842"/> “I have all this in my own mind, 
 <s n="843"/> but I remember that if we go now he will think we have broken the truce and gone out for war.
 <s n="844"/>Then again, firstly no-one will make us a market or help us to get provisions;
 <s n="845"/>secondly, there will be no-one to guide us;
 <s n="846"/>thirdly, if we do anything like that Ariaios will leave us at once.
 <s n="847"/>So we shall not have one friend left, and even those who were friends will be our enemies.”
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.4.6">
 <s n="848"/>“Then the river: if there is any other difficult river for us I don’t know, 
 <s n="849"/>but the Euphrates we know cannot be crossed if the enemy oppose.
 <s n="850"/>Further, we have no cavalry to help us if we must fight, but the enemy have plenty, and very good;
 <s n="851"/>so if we win, how could we kill anyone?
 <s n="852"/>And if we are beaten, none of us could escape.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.7">
 <s n="853"/>“As for the king, with all these things in his favour, if he really wishes to destroy us, I don’t know why we need swear oaths and give pledges, and then by perjury make his own word worthless to all the world, both ours and his!”
 <s n="854"/>He would often speak like this.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.8">
 <s n="855"/>Meanwhile Tissaphernes came with his forces, as on the road home, and Orontas came with his;
 <s n="856"/>he brought also the king’s daughter, his bride.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.9">
 <s n="857"/>They left the place at once, Tissaphernes leading and providing a market;
 <s n="858"/>Ariaios marched also at the head of Cyros’s national force, along with Tissaphernes and Orontas, and camped with them.
</section>


<section n="3" chapter="2.4.10">
 <s n="859"/>But the Hellenes suspected these, and kept to themselves with their own guides.
 <s n="860"/>They always camped with a distance between them, a league or more; 
 <s n="861"/>both parties watched each other like enemies, and this at once made more suspicion.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.11">
 <s n="862"/>Sometimes when they were gathering wood from the same place, and foraging for grass and such things, they came to blows with each other, 
 <s n="863"/> and this made more hostility.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.4.12">
 <s n="864"/>After they had gone three stages they reached what is called the Wall of Media, and passed behind it.
 <s n="865"/>This was built of baked bricks set in asphalt, twenty feet thick, one hundred high;
 <s n="866"/>its length was said to be twenty leagues,
 <s n="867"/> and it is not far from Babylon.
</section>

<section n="7" chapter="2.4.13">
 <s n="868"/>From this place they marched two stages, 8 leagues; 
 <s n="869"/> and they crossed two canals, one by a bridge, one by eight boats fastened together.
 <s n="870"/>These canals came from the River Tigris; 
 <s n="871"/> trenches are dug from them over the land, the first larger, then smaller ones,
 <s n="872"/> until at last they become little runnels such as we have in Hellas over millet fields.
 <s n="873"/>Then they reached the Tigris, 
 <s n="874"/>near which was a city, large and populous, named Sittace, distant from the river about a mile and a half.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.14">
 <s n="875"/>The Hellenes encamped near it beside a park, large and beautiful and thick with all sorts of trees;

</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.4.15">
 <s n="877"/>After dinner it happened that Proxenos and Xenophon were walking in front of the camp,
 <s n="878"/> and a man asked the sentries where he could see Proxenos or Clearchos;
 <s n="879"/>he did not ask for Menon, although he came from Ariaios, Menon’s friend.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.4.16">
 <s n="880"/>When Proxenos said, “I’m the man you are looking for,” the fellow said, 
 <s n="881"/>“I have been sent by Ariaios and Artaozos, who were true to Cyros and remain loyal to you. They bid you be on your guard against an attack to-night; 
 <s n="882"/> there is quite an army close by in the park.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.4.17">
 <s n="883"/>And they bid you to send a guard for the Tigris bridge, because Tissaphernes intends to break it down to-night that you may not cross but may be caught between the river and the canal.”
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="2.4.18">
 <s n="884"/>Hearing this they took him to Clearchos, and told him what he said.
 <s n="885"/>Clearchos was very much upset and alarmed.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.4.19">
 <s n="886"/>But a young man present observed that the attack and breaking down the bridge did not fit well together.
 <s n="887"/>“If they attack,” he said, “they must either win or lose.
 <s n="888"/>If they win, why break down the bridge?
 <s n="889"/>For then we could never escape and be safe however many bridges there are.”
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.20">
 <s n="890"/>“But if we win, with a broken bridge they will never escape themselves;

</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.21">
 <s n="892"/>Clearchos listened, and asked the messenger how much country there was between the Tigris and the canal.
 <s n="893"/>He said a great deal, and many villages and many large cities.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.4.22">
 <s n="894"/>Then he understood at once that the Persians had sent the man, for fear the Hellenes might cut the bridge and stay in the island, defended by the Tigris on one side and the canal on the other, 
 <s n="895"/> and might get their provisions from the country between, which was large and good with plenty of hands to till it;
 <s n="896"/>then again, it might be a refuge for anyone who wanted to damage the king.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.4.23">
 <s n="897"/>After this they went to rest;
 <s n="898"/> however, they still sent a guard for the bridge.
 <s n="899"/>And no-one attacked them from any part, and none of the enemy came to the bridge, as the guards reported.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.4.24">
 <s n="900"/>But at dawn they crossed the bridge, which was made of thirty-seven vessels fastened together;
 <s n="901"/> they took all possible precautions, for some Hellenes from Tissaphernes brought word that they meant to attack while they were crossing.
 <s n="902"/>But this was false;
 <s n="903"/> however, as they were crossing, Glus appeared with some scouts to see if they were crossing the river, 
 <s n="904"/>and when he saw, he galloped away.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="2.4.25">
 <s n="905"/>From the Tigris they marched four stages, 20 leagues, to the River Physcos, breadth 100 feet;
 <s n="906"/> there was a bridge across.
 <s n="907"/>There also was a large city, named Opis.
 <s n="908"/>There the Hellenes were met by the bastard brother of Cyros and Artaxerxes, from Susa and Ecbatana, bringing a large army to support the king; 
 <s n="909"/> and halting his army, he watched the Hellenes passing by.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.4.26">
 <s n="910"/>Clearchos led them two abreast, sometimes marching and sometimes halting.
 <s n="911"/>As long as the leading section of the army halted, so long there must be a halt through the whole army;
 <s n="912"/>so as the command ran down, the whole army seemed to be enormous, even to the Hellenes themselves, and the Persian was dumbfounded at the sight.
</section>


<section n="3" chapter="2.4.27">
 <s n="913"/>Thence they marched through Media seven desert stages, 30 leagues, as far as the villages of Parysatis, the mother of Cyros and Artaxerxes.
 <s n="914"/>These Tissaphernes, in mockery of Cyros, gave over to the Hellenes to plunder, but no captives to be taken.
 <s n="915"/>There was plenty of corn there and sheep and other things.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.4.28">
 <s n="916"/>From there they marched four desert stages, 20 leagues, keeping the Tigris on the left.
 <s n="917"/>At the first stage beyond the river was an inhabited city named Cainai, large and prosperous, from which the natives used to bring over on rafts of skin, loaves, cheeses, and wine.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.5.1">
 <s n="918"/>After this they reached the River Zapatas, breadth 400 feet.
 <s n="919"/>There they stayed three days;
 <s n="920"/> at this time there were suspicions, but no manifest plot.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.5.2">
 <s n="921"/>So Clearchos resolved to approach Tissaphernes, and see whether he could stop these suspicions before they brought war.
 <s n="922"/>He sent word that he wished to meet him.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="2.5.3">
 <s n="923"/>Tissaphernes readily invited him to come.
 <s n="924"/>When they went, Clearchos said:

 <s n="997"/>You lay down your arms, that is the king’s demand;

</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.5.39">
 <s n="999"/>The Hellenes made Cleanor their spokesman to answer, and he said, “You abominable wretch Ariaios, and you others who were friends of Cyros, have you no shame before gods and men?
 <s n="1000"/>You swore the oath to have the same friends and enemies as we did, and you have betrayed us, with Tissaphernes, that most impious and godless villain! You have murdered the very man to whom you gave your oath, and you have betrayed us all, and you join our enemies to come against us!”

<section n="3" chapter="2.5.40">

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.6">
 <s n="1016"/>These seem to me the doings of a man whose passion was war.When he could have kept at peace without shame or damage, he chose war; when he could have been idle, he wished for hard work that he might have war; when he could have kept wealth without danger, he chose to make it less by making war; 
 <s n="1017"/>there was a man who spent upon war as if it were a darling lover or some other pleasure.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.7">
 <s n="1018"/>So war was his passion; and he seemed a true soldier, because he loved perils;
 <s n="1019"/>ready to lead against the enemy by day or by night, and he kept his head in danger, as those with him agreed one and all in every place.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.8">
 <s n="1020"/>He had also the repute of a true leader, as far as was possible for a man of his character.
 <s n="1021"/>He was able to think out ways to get provisions for his forces, and then to get them; and he was able to fix firmly in their minds that Clearchos must be obeyed.
</section>





<section n="2" chapter="2.6.9">
 <s n="1022"/>This he did by being severe;
 <s n="1023"/> he was grim to look at and harsh in voice, he punished heavily and sometimes in anger, so that now and again he was sorry for it.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.10">
 <s n="1024"/>And he punished on principle, for he thought an unpunished army was good for nothing; indeed, he used to say that a soldier ought to fear his commander more than the enemy,
 <s n="1025"/>if he was to keep guard, or keep his hand off friends, or attack the enemy without excuses.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.11">
 <s n="1026"/>In danger, however, the soldiers wished absolutely to obey him and chose no other;
 <s n="1027"/>at such times his grimness appeared brightness, they said, his severity seemed strength against the enemy, so that they thought it salvation rather than severity.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.6.12">
 <s n="1028"/>But when the danger was past, many left him if there was an opportunity to pass over to other commanders;
 <s n="1029"/>for he had no charm, and he was always severe and cruel,
 <s n="1030"/>so the soldiers felt towards him as boys towards a schoolmaster.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.13">
 <s n="1031"/>But when they began to succeed in conquering an enemy under him, his men had strong motives to make them useful; for one thing, they felt confident of victory, 
 <s n="1032"/>and for another, they feared punishment from him, which made them obedient.
 
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.14">
 <s n="1033"/>But when they began to conquer the enemy with him, the benefits were great.
 <s n="1034"/>The soldiers gained courage against the enemy and feared his discipline, which made them orderly.

 <s n="1035"/>Such was Clearchos as a commander;

 <s n="1038"/>Proxenos the Boeotian ever since the days of his youth had longed to become a man capable of doing great things;

</section>

<section n="2" chapter="2.6.17">
 <s n="1040"/>After being with Gorgias he thought himself at once quite capable of being a ruler,

</section>

<section n="1" chapter="2.6.18">
 <s n="1042"/>Yet although he longed so much for these great things, all the same it was quite clear that he did not wish to get any of them by injustice; with justice and honour he thought these things ought to be got, but not without.

<section n="3" chapter="2.6.19">
 <s n="1043"/>To rule gentlemen he was well able,
 <s n="1044"/>but still he could not put fear or respect for himself into his soldiers. Indeed, he had rather respect for the soldiers than they had for him,

</section>

<section n="3" chapter="2.6.20">
 <s n="1046"/>He thought that to praise one who did well, and not to praise the offender, was enough to make a ruler and the reputation of a ruler.

<section n="3" chapter="2.6.27">
 <s n="1061"/>To make his soldiers obedient, his principle was to share in their misdeeds;

 <s n="1064"/>There are indeed certain obscure charges against him which may not be true, but here are some things which everyone knows.
 <s n="1065"/>He was in the bloom of his youth when he got command of the mercenaries from Aristippos; he became very intimate with Ariaios, who was a barbarian, because the man liked handsome lads; he himself, while yet beardless, had a bearded favourite in Tharypas.

 <s n="1071"/>After the captains had been seized, and the officers and men who were their escort had been cut down, the Hellenes were in despair, full of anxiety.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.3">
 <s n="1072"/>These thoughts passed through their minds and made them spiritless.
 <s n="1073"/>Few of them tasted food that evening, few lit a fire; many of them never came into camp that night, but they rested each where he chanced to be.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.4">
 <s n="1074"/>There was in the army an Athenian, Xenophon, who came with them neither as captain nor officer nor man, but Proxenos had invited him to come, being an old family friend. 
 <s n="1075"/> Proxenos promised, if he would come, to introduce him to Cyros, who was, he said, more than home and country to himself.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.5">
 <s n="1076"/>Xenophon read his letter, and consulted Socrates the philosopher about this trip.
 <s n="1077"/>Socrates had a suspicion that there might be some state objection to his being friendly with Cyros, because Cyros had favoured the Lacedaimonians in their war against Athens; so he advised Xenophon to go to Delphi and inquire of the oracle about this journey.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.6">
 <s n="1078"/>Accordingly Xenophon went and asked Apollo what god he should sacrifice and pray to, that he might best accomplish the journey he had in mind, and come back safe and successful.
 <s n="1079"/>Apollo named the gods to whom he must sacrifice.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.7">
 <s n="1080"/>When he came back he told the oracle to Socrates.
 <s n="1081"/>But Socrates blamed him because he had not asked first whether it was better for him to go or to stay, but just decided to go, and then asked how he could best do it.
 <s n="1082"/>“But,” said he, “since you did ask that, you must do what the god bids.”
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.1.8">
 <s n="1083"/>So Xenophon sacrificed to those gods as he was directed, and set sail; and at Sardis he found Proxenos and Cyros on the point of going up country, and then he was introduced to Cyros.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.9">
 <s n="1084"/>Proxenos urged him to stay, and Cyros urged him too, and promised he would send him home as soon as the campaign was over.
 <s n="1085"/>The expedition was said to be against the Pisidians.
</section>

<section n="5" chapter="3.1.10">
 <s n="1086"/>And so he joined it, being thus deceived—but not by Proxenos, 
 else of the Hellenes except Clearchos.
 <s n="1087"/>for he did not know of the attack to be made upon the king, nor did anyone else of the Hellenes except Clearchos.
 <s n="1088"/>However, when they got as far as Cilicia, it seemed to be clear to all that they were marching against the king.
 <s n="1089"/>Most of them followed for shame of one another and Cyros, although they feared the journey and went against their will.
 <s n="1090"/>And one of these was Xenophon.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.11">
 <s n="1091"/>And now in their desperate plight, he was unhappy like the rest and could not sleep.
 <s n="1092"/>But he did snatch a nap, and then he saw a dream.
 <s n="1093"/>He thought there was lightning and a thunderbolt fell on his father’s house, and all was in a blaze.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.12">
 <s n="1094"/>He woke at once in terror; the dream he judged to be good in one way, because amid troubles and dangers he seemed to see a great light from Zeus.
 <s n="1095"/>But in another way he feared, because he considered the dream to come from Zeus the king and the blaze of fire seemed to be all round, so he feared difficulties would fence him in all round, and he might not be able to get out of the country of the king.
</section>
<section n="2" chapter="3.1.13">
<s n="1096"/> But what such a dream really means may be seen from what happened afterwards; 
<s n="1097"/>and this is what happened. 
<s n="1098"/>As soon as he was awake, the first thought that came into his head was, 
<s n="1099"/>“Why do I lie here? 
<s n="1100"/>The night is going on, 
<s n="1101"/>and with daylight it is likely the enemy will come. 
<s n="1102"/>If we fall into the power of the king, now we must see the most cruel sights, and feel the most terrible pains, and die by violence—and how can it be helped? 

</section>
<section n="4" chapter="3.1.14">
 <s n="1103"/>But how are we to defend ourselves?
 <s n="1104"/>No-one is preparing for that, no-one cares about that, but we lie here as if it were possible to live in peace and quiet!
 <s n="1105"/>What about me then?
 <s n="1106"/>What captain from what country do I expect to do that?
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.15">
 <s n="1107"/>Then he got up, and first called together the underofficers of Proxenos.
 <s n="1108"/>When they were collected he said: "Gentlemen, I cannot sleep and I don’t think you can.
 <s n="1109"/>And I can’t lie here when I see what a plight we are in."
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.1.16">
 <s n="1110"/>It is clear that the enemy did not show us open war until they thought they had everything well prepared; and no one among us takes the pains to make the best possible resistance.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.17">
 <s n="1111"/>Yet if we give way and fall into the king’s power, what do we expect our fate will be?
 <s n="1112"/>When his own half-brother was dead, the man cut off his head and cut off his hand and stuck them up on a pole.
 <s n="1113"/>We have no one to plead for us, and we marched here to make the king a slave or to kill him if we could, and what do you think our fate will be?
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.18">
 <s n="1114"/>Would he not go to all extremes of torture to make the whole world afraid of making war on him?
 <s n="1115"/>Why, we must do anything to keep out of his power!
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.1.19">
 <s n="1116"/>While the truce lasted, I never ceased pitying ourselves, I never ceased congratulating the king and his army.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.20">
 <s n="1117"/>But when I thought of these our soldiers—we had no share in all these good things unless we bought them, and few had anything left to buy with; and to procure anything without buying was debarred by our oaths.
 <s n="1118"/>While I reasoned like this, I sometimes feared the truce more than the war now.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.21">
 <s n="1119"/>However, now they have broken the truce, there is an end both to their insolence and to our suspicion.
 <s n="1120"/>There lie all these good things before us, prizes for whichever side proves the better men; the gods are the judges of the contest, and they will be with us, naturally.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.22">
 <s n="1121"/>These men are perjured before them,
 <s n="1122"/> while we saw so many good things and kept strictly away from them because of our oaths sworn to the gods.

 <s n="1124"/>Besides, our bodies are better fitted than theirs for bearing cold and heat and hardship.

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.24">
 <s n="1127"/>Perhaps others are now thinking the same, but in heaven’s name don’t let us wait for someone else to come and pat us on the back and say, 'Go it. Here’s a grand enterprise!'

 <s n="1130"/>The officers on hearing this address all asked him to be their leader, except a certain Apollonides who spoke in the Boeotian dialect.
 <s n="1131"/>He said it was all nonsense to pretend that any safety could be found except with the king’s consent, if that could be had, and at the same time he began to speak of the difficulties.
 <s n="1132"/>But Xenophon cut him short and said:
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.27">
 <s n="1133"/>“Man, I’m amazed at you! You have eyes to see, but you understand not; you have ears to hear, but you remember not!

</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.1.28">
 <s n="1135"/>We refused to give them up, but went and encamped beside him. What didn’t he do! Sent ambassadors, asked for a truce, gave provisions till he got it!

 <s n="1136"/>And when the captains and officers did what you tell us to do, and went for a conference without arms, trusting to this truce—where are they now?

</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.1.30">
 <s n="1138"/>In my opinion, men, we ought not to let this man be one of us.
 <s n="1139"/>We ought to take his rank from him, and put a pack on his back, and make him carry for us. This man is a disgrace to his own country and to all Hellas, because he is a Hellene and yet behaves like this.”

<section n="3" chapter="3.1.32">
 <s n="1142"/>And so they were; accordingly, they drove him away.

 <s n="1195"/>While he was speaking someone sneezed; the soldiers hearing this, kissed their hands to heaven.

 <s n="1288"/>After these harangues, they went and burnt the wagons and tents; superfluous things they gave to any who wanted them, and threw the rest into the fire.
 <s n="1289"/>This done, they took breakfast.
 <s n="1290"/>While they were at breakfast, up came Mithradates with about thirty horsemen, and, calling the captains within hearing, he spoke as follows:
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="3.3.2">
 <s n="1291"/>“I was faithful to Cyros, as you know, Hellenes, and now I am friendly to you; indeed I spend my days here in great fear.
 <s n="1292"/>So if I saw that you had some profitable plan for safety,
 <s n="1293"/>I would join you with all my servants.
 <s n="1294"/>Tell me, then, what you have in mind, and regard me as a friend and well-wisher, willing to make my journey along with you.”
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="3.3.3">
 <s n="1295"/>The captains consulted, and decided to answer this, 
 <s n="1296"/>with Cheirisophos as spokesman:
 <s n="1297"/>“We are resolved to pass through the country doing as little damage as possible, if we are left alone;
 <s n="1298"/>but if anyone tries to hinder our passage, we will fight him as stoutly as we can.”
</section>




<section n="3" chapter="3.3.4">
 <s n="1299"/>After this Mithradates tried to show them that it was impossible to save their lives except with the king’s consent.
 <s n="1300"/>Then it became clear that he was a spy; 
 <s n="1301"/>for one of the relations of Tissaphernes was there to keep him loyal.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.5">
 <s n="1302"/>After this the captains thought it best to proclaim war without parley for as long as they were in the enemy country;
 <s n="1303"/>for they used to come and try to corrupt the soldiers, and they did corrupt one officer, Nicarchos the Arcadian, who deserted at night with about twenty men.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.6">
 <s n="1304"/>After this, they breakfasted and crossed the Zapatas River;
 <s n="1305"/>then began their march in order, with baggage and mob in the middle. They had not gone very far when Mithradates appeared again with some two hundred horsemen and bowmen and slingers, four hundred or so, very light and trim.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="3.3.7">
 <s n="1306"/>He came towards them in friendly fashion, 
 <s n="1307"/>but when they were near suddenly there were arrows from both horse and foot, and the slingers too wounded many.
 <s n="1308"/>The Hellenic rearguard suffered severely but could do nothing in return:
 <s n="1309"/>for the range of the Cretan bowmen was less than the Persian, and besides being bare they had to be inside the defenses, and the slingers were beyond the range of their javelins.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.3.8">
 <s n="1310"/>So Xenophon ordered pursuit, 
 <s n="1311"/>and the men-at-arms and targeteers of his rearguard did pursue,
 <s n="1312"/>but they caught none of the enemy.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.9">
 <s n="1313"/>For the Hellenes had no horsemen, and the footmen could not catch the enemy footmen with a long start in a short run;
 <s n="1314"/>of course they could not go far from the army,
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.3.10">
 <s n="1315"/>and the barbarian horsemen shot arrows behind them as they rode and hit them, besides they had to come back all that way fighting.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.3.11">
 <s n="1316"/>The result was that they made no more than three miles or so in all that day,
 <s n="1317"/>but towards evening they reached the villages.
 <s n="1318"/>Then again there was great discouragement. Cheirisophos and the older captains blamed Xenophon because he left the lines to pursue, and risked himself but could do no harm to the enemy.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.12">
 <s n="1319"/>Xenophon listened, and said they were quite right in blaming him, as the result had showed.
 <s n="1320"/>“But I was compelled to pursue,” he said, “when I saw that we suffered so badly by standing still and we could do nothing in return.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.13">
 <s n="1321"/>When we did pursue, what you say is the truth,” says he;
 <s n="1322"/>“we could do them no damage, and got back with great difficulty.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.3.14">
 <s n="1323"/>Thank God they had only a small force, so they could not hurt us seriously, but they showed us what we want.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.15">
 <s n="1324"/>Their arrows and slings have such a range that the Cretans cannot reach them, nor those who throw by hand;
 <s n="1325"/>and when we pursue, it is impossible to go far from our army, and in a short space not even a fast runner could catch a runner with a bowshot start.
</section>


<section n="3" chapter="3.3.16">
 <s n="1326"/>Well, then, if we are to keep them from damaging us on the march, we must find slingers and horsemen at once.
 <s n="1327"/>I hear there are Rhodians in the army, and most of them know how to sling, as they say, and their shot has twice the range of the Persians.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.3.17">
 <s n="1328"/>The Persians use a stone as big as your fist, and so they cannot throw far, but the Rhodians know how to use leaden bullets.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.3.18">
 <s n="1329"/>If we can discover, then, which of them possess a sling and pay them extra for this, and pay for plaiting more slings, and invent some other privilege for those willing to be posted as slingers, perhaps we shall find some useful men.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.19">
 <s n="1330"/>I see also that there are horses with us; I have some myself, some were left by Clearchos, many others which we captured are carrying baggage.
 <s n="1331"/>If we take the pick of these, and put other animals to carry, we can use the horses for cavalry, and perhaps these will do damage in the pursuit.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.3.20">
 <s n="1332"/>This was agreed to; 
 <s n="1333"/> and that night about 200 slingers were found up, and the next day some 50 horses and horsemen were passed as fitting, and buff jackets and corselets were provided for them, and Lycios the Athenian, Polystratos’ son, was put in command of the horse.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.1">
 <s n="1334"/>They stayed there that day, and on the next began the march earlier than usual,
 <s n="1335"/> for they had to pass through a ravine where they feared the enemy might attack them in the pass.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.2">
 <s n="1336"/>When they had passed, Mithradates appeared again with 1,000 cavalry and some 4,000 bowmen and slingers.
 <s n="1337"/>He had demanded so many from Tissaphernes, and promised that if he got them he would deliver the Hellenes into his hand: he despised them because in the former attack with a small force he had done much damage, as he thought, and suffered nothing at all.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.3">
 <s n="1338"/>When the Hellenes had gone about a mile from the pass, Mithradates came through with his force.
 <s n="1339"/>Orders had been given which of the targeteers and men-at-arms were to pursue, and the horsemen were told to pursue boldly and a sufficient force would follow.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.4">
 <s n="1340"/>So when Mithradates caught them up, and arrows and slingstones began to come, a trumpet sounded for the Hellenes, and the appointed parties doubled out at once and the horsemen galloped; the enemy did not wait for them but ran back into the ravine.
 <s n="1341"/>In this pursuit, many of the barbarians were killed, and some of the cavalry were taken alive, about eighteen.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.5">
 <s n="1342"/>The dead bodies were mutilated by the Hellenes unbidden, to strike terror into the enemy.
 <s n="1343"/>They only imitated the Persian custom.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.4.6">
 <s n="1344"/>But the enemy retired after this, and the Hellenes marched unmolested the rest of the day as far as the River Tigris.
</section>

<section n="6" chapter="3.4.7">
 <s n="1345"/>A large deserted city was there, named Larisa, 
 <s n="1346"/>which had once been inhabited by Medes.
 <s n="1347"/>The wall of this place was five-and-twenty feet thick, and one hundred high, 
 <s n="1348"/>the whole being two leagues round.
 <s n="1349"/>It was built of clay bricks, 
 <s n="1350"/>on a stone base twenty feet high.
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="3.4.8">
 <s n="1351"/>When the Persians took the empire from the Medes the Persian king besieged this place and could not take it in any way; 
 <s n="1352"/>then a cloud covered the sun and hid it until the people escaped, and so it was taken.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.9">
 <s n="1353"/>Near this city was a stone pyramid, one hundred feet wide and two hundred high.
 <s n="1354"/>On this pyramid were many of the natives who had escaped from the villages near.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="3.4.10">
 <s n="1355"/>From this place they marched one stage, 6 leagues, to a large deserted fortress named Mespila,
 <s n="1356"/>formerly inhabited by Medes.
 <s n="1357"/>The foundation was made of polished stone full of shells, fifty feet wide and fifty high.
 <s n="1358"/>The circuit was 6 leagues.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.4.11">
 <s n="1359"/>The foundation was made of polished stone full of shells, fifty feet wide and fifty high.
 <s n="1360"/>The circuit was 6 leagues.
 <s n="1361"/>There the king’s wife Medeia, is said to have taken refuge when the Medes lost their empire to the Persians.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.12">
 <s n="1362"/>The Persian king besieged this place, but could not take it either by time or by force; 
 <s n="1363"/>but Zeus affrighted the inhabitants by thunder, and so it was taken.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.13">
 <s n="1364"/>From this place they marched one stage, 4 leagues.
 <s n="1365"/>On this stage Tissaphernes appeared, with his own cavalry and the forces of Orontas, who married the king’s daughter, and the nationals whom Cyros had brought up country with him, and those whom the king’s brothers had brought to support the king; it so appeared to be an immense army.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.4.14">
 <s n="1366"/>When he was near he stationed some ranks in the rear, and led others along the flanks, but he dared not attack and he wished to run no risk, only gave orders to shoot with bow and sling.
</section>

<section n="1" chapter="3.4.15">
 <s n="1367"/>But the Rhodians posted here and there slung their bullets and the bowmen shot their arrows, and not one missed a man (he would have found it hard to miss if he had tried); so Tissaphernes quickly retreated out of range, and the other ranks retreated too.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.4.16">
 <s n="1368"/>For the rest of the day they went on marching,
 <s n="1369"/> and the barbarians did no harm by their sharpshooting; 
 <s n="1370"/>for the Rhodians had longer range than the Persians, even the bowmen.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.4.17">
 <s n="1371"/>The Persian bows are very large;
 <s n="1372"/> so the arrows they picked up were useful to the Cretans, who practised with them, shooting high and as far as possible.
 <s n="1373"/>Plenty of gut was found in the villages, and lead, which they used for the slings.
</section>

<section n="4" chapter="3.4.18">
 <s n="1374"/>So on this day, after the Hellenes had encamped in villages which they found, the barbarians had the worst of that skirmish, and retreated.
 <s n="1375"/>The day following the Hellenes spent in the villages collecting provisions,
 <s n="1376"/> for there was plenty of corn there.
 <s n="1377"/>Next day they marched on over the plain, and Tissaphernes followed, skirmishing.
</section>


<section n="2" chapter="3.4.19">
 <s n="1378"/>Now the Hellenes discovered that the square was a bad formation with the enemy following.
 <s n="1379"/>If the wings of the square draw together when the road is narrow, or where the hills make it necessary, or a bridge, the armed men must be greatly distressed and march badly; they are squeezed up and disordered at the same time, so they are not easy to manage because they lose discipline.
</section>

<section n="3" chapter="3.4.20">
 <s n="1380"/>Again, when the wings open again after their late distress, the ranks must be separated again, and there are empty spaces between, and all are discouraged with an enemy behind.
 <s n="1381"/>Or if they have to cross a bridge or some other crossing, each man tries to get over first, 
 <s n="1382"/>and then it is easy for the enemy to attack.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.21">
 <s n="1383"/>When the commanders perceived this they made six companies of a hundred men each, and appointed a lieutenant to command each, and officers for each half-company and quarter-company.
 <s n="1384"/>When the wings drew in on the march these companies fell to the rear so as not to confuse the wings, and they lined up outside the wings.
</section>

<section n="2" chapter="3.4.22">
 <s n="1385"/>When the wings expanded again they filled up the gap in the line between, in line of companies in column if narrow, half-companies if wider, quarter-companies very wide, 
 <s n="1386"/>and so the gap was always filled.

</section>




<section n="5" chapter="3.4.41">
