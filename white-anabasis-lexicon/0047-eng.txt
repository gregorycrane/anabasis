*Artikés, 7, dv, of or belonging
to Attica, Attic, i.5.6. Attica was
a country in the southeastern part
of Northern Greece, forming a tri-
angular peninsula, of which two
sides were washed by the sea and
the third was separated from Boe-
otia and Megaris by mountains.
Its area, Salamis included, was
748 sq. miles, and its population in
the fifth century B.c., excluding its
capital, Athens, was about 350,000
(see’A@Hvac). A poor country for
agricultural and pastoral pursuits,
it was rich in marble quarries and
silver mines.
