᾿Αργεῖος, a, ov ["Apyos, 76, Ar-

masc., an Argive, iv. 2. 13, 17.
Argos, the capital of Argolis or
Argeia, was situated in a level
plain a little to the west of the Ina-
chus, and was, according to Greek
tradition, the oldest city in Pelo-
ponnésus. Said to have been built
by Inachus, it was in mythological
times the capital city of Danaus,
Acrisius, and Orestes. In Homer
Argos is subordinate to Mycénae.
On its first appearance in history,
about 750 B.c., it was the most
important city in the peninsula.
Owing to destructive wars with
Sparta, its power declined, and it
took no part in the Persian wars,
but, having partially recovered,
sided with the Athenians in the
Peloponnesian war. It was fa-
mous for its worship of Hera.
