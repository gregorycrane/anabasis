op0ds—dpuKtés

in line (see s.v. pddayé) with the
Aéxo. (having each a front of 24
and a depth of 4 men) ranged side
by side, each company could be
brought into ‘column’ by advan-
cing the first enomoty at the right
(see s.v. €vwporia) a sufficient dis-
tance before the line and deploy-
ing the second, third, and fourth
enomoties to the right to a position
behind it. The dps Acxos thus
formed would have a front of 6 and
a depth of 16 men, and spaces
would be left between the columns.
But the front and depth of the
column varied according to circum-
stances. The essential feature of
the formation was that the depth
of the column should be greater
than the front, and that spaces
should be left between columns.
