(immets, q.v.), lil. 4. 48, of. i. 8. 6,
iii. 3. 20. The @#paé consisted
of two metal plates, made to fit
the person (see cut s.v. drdov), of
which one protected the breast
and abdomen, the other the back.
These were hinged on one side
and buckled on the other. They
were further kept in place by
leathern straps passing over the
shoulders from behind and fas-
tened in front, and by the belt (see
s.v. févn and s.v. domls, No. 10).
About the lower part of the cui-
rass was a series of flaps (répv-
ves, q.v.) of leather or felt, covered
with metal, which protected the
hips and groin of the wearer, while
not in the least interfering with his
freedom of movement. A lighter
and less expensive cuirass was in-
troduced at an early period, and was
called omodds, g.v. The Chalybes,
further, wore corselets of linen, iv.
7.15. See also s.v. Nevxobwpakt. For
additional representations of the
cuirass, see s.v. dpua (No. 8, the
