Arcadia was the country in the
centre of Peloponnésus, mountain-
ous and surrounded by mountains,
and watered by many streams, esp.
the Alphéus. The Arcadians were
a strong, brave, and active race,
of a simplicity of life which has
been exaggerated by poets into an
ideal excellence. They were de-
voted to hunting and pastoral pur-
suits. ‘They worshipped especially
Pan and Artemis. They were fine
soldiers, and, with the Achaeans,
formed more than half of the
Greek force of Cyrus, vi. 2. 10.

(ἄξων), wheels, and pole. In the
war-chariot the δίφρος was large

 

enough, as the name implies, to
accommodate both the warrior and
his driver (see s.v. ἡνίοχος). It
consisted of the floor, and of en-
closing sides that protected the oc-
cupants. At the top of this bar-
rier in front was a curved rim (4p-
tvé), Which could be grasped by
the hand or serve as a place to

were generally curved rims also at
each side of the chariot behind, to
assist in mounting. The chariot

The latter were of small diameter,
