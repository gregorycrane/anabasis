*Aynoidaos, 6, Agesilaus, king
of Sparta from B.c. 398 to 361-360.
He obtained the throne on the
death of his brother Agis, whose
son Leotychides was declared ille-
gitimate. Although unattractive
in person, and lame, he was always
famous as patriot, warrior, and
general. In command of the ex-
pedition against Persia in 396, he
was victorious in Asia Minor until
394, when he was recalled on the
news of the alliance of Athens,
Thebes, and other states against
Sparta. Xenophon accompanied
him on his return, v. 3. 6, and is
said to have been with him at his
victory at Coronéa. He twice saved
the city of Sparta from the attacks
of Epaminondas, and died during
a campaign in Egypt at the age of
80. An encomium on Agesilaus is
attributed to Xenophon.
