shield (see s.v. πέλτη). There is
no evidence in the Anab. that they
had other defensive armour, but
doubtless they were offensively
armed with a sword as well as with
spears. Of the latter they carried
probably several, which were hurled
with (v. 2. 12) or without the thong.

After the expedition of the Ten
Thousand, they were developed
by the Athenian Iphicrates into a

 

distinct branch of the service,
combining the peculiar advantages
both of heavy-armed and light-
armed troops. Iphicrates added
to the shield a linen corselet, in-
creased the length of the spear
and sword, and invented an im-
proved sort of boots, which took
his name. The peltasts among the
Ten Thousand were largely Thra-
cians, i. 2. 9, but those of other
races are specifically named, i. 2.
6. This sort of troops was of
Thracian origin, cf. vi. 3. 4, vil. 3.
40. In contrast with hoplites, the
peltasts were detailed to service
that required celerity of move-
ment, iv. 3. 22, 4. 20, 6. 25, 8. 18,
cf. vi. 3.4. In the Anab. they are
sometimes contrasted with bow-
men, i. 2. 9, iv. 8. 15, with bowmen
and slingers, iv. 3. 27, v. 6. 15, and
once with the ψτλοί, z.e. light-armed
troops of any sort not armed with
the shield, v. 2. 16. But they
probably usurped the place of the
ἀκοντισταί, ν. 6. 1ὅ, who are but
seldom mentioned; and since the
bowmen and slingers were few ἴῃ
number relatively to the peltasts,
the term zeAracral is constantly
used as a designation of the light-
armed troops in general as con-
trasted with the heavy-armed. Cf.
i. 2. 9, where in an enumeration
of the forces of Cyrus 2000 pel-
tasts are named as representing
the total of the light-armed troops
in contrast with 11,000 hoplites.
