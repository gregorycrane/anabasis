It was one of the institutions of
Lycurgus that the Spartans should
go into battle wearing wreaths (cf.
iv. 3.17); and the priest that offici-
ated at the altar in sacrifice always
wore a chaplet (cf. vii. 1.40). The
use of orégavor among the Greeks,
on both private and public occa-
sions, was very common.
