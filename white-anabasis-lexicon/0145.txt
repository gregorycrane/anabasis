Λυδία, as [Avéds], Lydia, i. 2. 5,
iii. 5. 15, vii. 8. 20, a fertile country
in the western part of Asia Minor,
irrigated by the gold-bearing rivers
Hermus and Pactolus. Its chief
city was Sardis. Under Croesus
it was a powerful and prosperous
kingdom, but after his defeat by
Cyrus the Great, in 546 B.c., it was
made a Persian satrapy, i. 9. 7,
with the following boundaries,
which it retained also under the
Romans: on the north Mysia,
east Phrygia, south the Maeander,
separating it from Caria, and west
Ionia. Under the Persians the
previous warlike nature of the
people was softened into that
effeminacy of life for which Lyd-
ians were afterwards famous.

Λύκειον, τό [ἐΓ. Επρ. lyceum],
the Lyceum, a gymnasium just
outside the wall of Athens to the
east, and near a temple of Apollo
Lycaeus, vii. 8.1. Its foundation
was ascribed by some to Pisistra-
tus, by others to Pericles. Lycur-
gus embellished it with gardens
and a palaestra. Here the Athen-
ians exercised under arms before
a war, and here was the tribunal
of the Polemarch. Aristotle used
the gardens for his lectures.
