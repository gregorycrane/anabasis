Kipos, 6 [ Pers. Kurash], Cyrus,
called 6 apxatos, the Ancient or the
kider, i. 9.1, Cyrus the Great, the
founder of the Persian monarchy,
According to Xen. and Hdt., he
was the son of Cambyses, a Per-
sian noble, and Mandane, daughter
of Astyages, king of Media, whom
he overthrew and succeeded, reign-
ing from 560-529 n.c. But mod-
ern investigations have shown that
Ctesias (see Krnolas) was right in
stating that Cyrus was not related
to Astyages. He was in reality of
pure Persian stock, the descend-
ant of Achaemenes in the fifth
eeneration — Hakhaminis, Ksha’-
ispis, Kurash I, Kambudshia
(Cambyses I.), Kurash II. (Cy-
rus). His ancestors, of Iranian
stock like the Medes, coming from
Parsua in the north, had gradu-
ally moved down towards the Me-
dian empire, and Cyrus, becoming
king of Anshan (Anzan) in 558 B.c.,
carried on an active war against
Astyages, king of Media, until, in
550 B.c. the latter’s army revolted,
and Astyages and his ci rpital, Ke-
ee fell into the enemy’s hands.

Cyrus enlarged the Median em-
pire by the conquest of the Lydian
kingdom of Croesus. The capture
of Babylon in 539, followed by the
extension of his domains to the
borders of India, made him the
monarch of the entire East. He
was succeeded in 529 by his son

Cambyses II., the invader of
Egypt. Xenophon’s work called
the Cyropaedia is not a real his-
tory, but an historical romance in
which Cyrus is presented as the
highest type of a ruler.

Kipos, 6 [ Persian Aurash |, Cyrus
the Younger, whose ill-fated expe-
dition is described in the Anabasis.
He was the son of Darius Nothus
and Parysatis, i. 1. 1, and was born
after his father’s accession (425 p.c.)
