Θετταλία, as [Gerrards], Thes-
saly, the most northern state of
Greece, i. 1. 10, consisting origi-
nally of the valley of the Penéus,
with the district of Thessaliotis on
the west and that of Pelasgidtis on
the east. In these were the most
important cities comprising the
Thessalian state. To these were
added, by constant conquests, Hes-
tiaedtis and Phthidtis on the north
and south. Magnesia and some
other outlying districts were not
part of Thessaly before the Mace-
donian period. On the northern
boundary of Thessaly was Mt.
Olympus, the fabled home of the
gods, with the vale of Tempe be-
low it. The plain of Thessaly was
very fertile, producing much grain
and supporting cattle and horses,
the Thessalian cavalry being noted
for its efficiency. The government
was oligarchical, and the country

 

was divided into the four political
| divisions mentioned above, all be-
| ing nominally under a chief magis-
| trate called τᾶγός.
