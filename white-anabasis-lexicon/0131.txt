1. 10. It lay south of Lycaonia

from Pamphylia on the west by

on the east by Syria (888 πύλη).
The western part was mountain-
ous, but in the east lay the Cilician
plain. ‘Tarsus was the chief city.
According to the myth the country
was named from Cilix, son of Age-
nor and brother of Phoenix. The
mountaineers lived the free life of
the bandit, the rest of the people
were famous pirates. Pompey sub-
dued the latter, 67 B.c., and the
country was organized as a Roman
province. Cicero was proconsul in
51-60 B.c.
