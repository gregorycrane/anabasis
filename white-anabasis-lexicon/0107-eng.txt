"Hietos, a, ov [’HXs, Elis), a
dweller in Elis, an Elean, ii. 2. 20,
vi. 4. 10, vii. 8. 10. Elis was the
name of a state in the western
part of Peloponnésus, bounded
by Achaea, Arcadia, Messenia,
and the sea. Its western shore
was low and sandy, through its
middle ran the large river Al-
phéus, and the mountains on the
eastern border were comparatively
low. Its independence was, there-
fore, not due to natural causes, but
to the fact that it contained Olym-
pia (q.v.), and therefore generally
enjoyed exemption from war. It
produced flax and timber, and was
noted for its horses.
