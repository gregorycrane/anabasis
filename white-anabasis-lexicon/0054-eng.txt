Bowwria, as [Bows], Boeotia,
iii. 1. 31, a country in northern
Greece, bounded on the north by
the territory of the Opuntian Lo-
crians, east by the Euboean sea,
south by Attica, Megaris, and the
Corinthian gulf, and west by Pho-
cis. Its position, between seas and
mountains, and its numerous lakes
and marshes, rendered the cli-
mate damp and subject to frequent
changes, and its cloudy skies made
the air thick and heavy. To this
and to the fact that the Boeotians
were great eaters may be ascribed
the natural dullness attributed to
them, especially by the lively Athe-
nians, which passed into a prov-
erb. Yet Boeotia furnished not
only good soldiers, athletes, and
flute-players, but also several great
generals, poets, and historians.
Under Epaminondas it became for
a short time the mistress of Hellas.
Boeotia was settled by Aeolians
from Thessaly after the Trojan
war.

mountains, and bringing purer and
cooler air.
