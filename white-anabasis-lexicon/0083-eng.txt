“EdAnotovtos, 6 [°EAAn + 7ér-
tos], the Hellespont, i.e. Helle’s
sea, named, according to the myth,
from Helle, who was drowned in
it while riding with her brother
Phrixus on the ram with the golden
fleece to escape their stepmother
Ino. It is the strait (Dardanelles)
separating Europe from Asia and
connecting the Propontis with the
Aegéan. The ancients called it 400
stadia long and 7 stadia wide at
its narrowest part. Here Leander
swam across to visit Hero, and here
Xerxes built his famous bridge.
The possession of this strait was
of the utmost importance to Ath-
ens, as it was the key to the coun-
tries on which she depended for
grain; hence it was the scene of
several important naval battles.
The name is also extended to the
neighbouring coast, which was full
of Greek cities, i. 1. 9, ii. 6. 3, vii.
