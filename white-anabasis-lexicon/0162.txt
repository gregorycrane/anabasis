his serving against the Persians and
with Spartans, and in
394 B.c. left Asia Minor
with Agesilaus and fol-
lowed him against The-
bes and Athens in the battle of
Coronéa, v. 3.6. The Spartans pre-
sented him with an estate at Scillus
in Elis about 387, where he erected
a little temple to Artemis, v. 3.7 ff.,
and where he lived in retirement
with his wife Philesia, and his sons
Gryllus 4nd Diodorus. Here were
written his well-known works.
After the battle of Leuctra, 371
B.c., the Eléans drove him out of
Scillus and he went to Corinth.
According to some the Athenians
withdrew their sentence of banish-
ment against him, and his last
years were spent in his native city ;
others state that he died in Cor-
inth. It is certain that his sons
were in the service of Athens, and
that the elder fell at Mantinéa in
362. Xenophon himself died not
later than 355. His principal works
were the Anabasis, Hellenica,
Memorabilia of Socrates, Cyropae-
dia, Symposium, and (if they be
genuine works of Xen.) the Lace-
daemonian State and Agesilaus.
