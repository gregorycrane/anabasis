The κρατήρ,
as used at Greek symposia, was
designed to hold a large quantity
of wine and water mixed (for the
universal Greek custom of drink-
ing wine diluted, see s.v. &kpatos).
It was therefore a bulky vessel.
The liquor was drawn from it by

 

Ss

attendants (see s.v. oivoxdos), who
dipped into it their jugs or other
vessels. The mixer was, therefore,
broad at the top. Its form is
shown in the accompanying illus-
tration. The body of the vessel
rested on a foot and base. It had
two handles, which were generally,
but not always, attached to the
lower part of the vessel. For an
additional illustration, see s.v. rpi-

| mous, No. 74.
