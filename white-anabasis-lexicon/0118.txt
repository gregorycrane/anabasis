E is an entrance. F is the goal
farthest from the starting-point, G
the ‘finish.’ Over against G at H
is the judges’ stand. D is a por-
tico facing the course, C is a tri-
angular space bounded on two
sides by the stations, a, 0, c, etc.,
from which the chariots started, on
the right, and to which they might
return, on the left, in case they
did not leave the hippodrome al-
together. A is an altar, J the
‘seratch.’ On the former was a
bronze eagle with extended wings,
at the latter a dolphin. The ele-
vation of the eagle and the fall
of the dolphin, managed by some
sort of machinery, marked the be-
ginning of the race. The chariot
at a was the first to be sent off,
the chariot at 6 started when the
first came in line, and so for the
others. They were all in line at J,
but those on the outside had the
advantage of a ‘flying-start’ over
those placed nearer the ‘ pole,’
and thus the conditions of the
race were equalised. The distance
between the goals was probably
two stadia (1200 Greek feet). The
race varied in length according to
the number of times the com-
plete circuit was covered. Sin-
ele horses were also run at the
