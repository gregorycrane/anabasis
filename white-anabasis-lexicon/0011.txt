DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.

WHEN a verb is ‘regular’ and all the six ‘principal parts’ are
found in Attic Greek, only the present and future tenses are given,
followed by etc. The parts of ‘irregular verbs’ are given in full, so
far as they occur in the authors, as well as all the existing parts of
those ‘regular’ verbs of which some parts are not found in Attic.
The theme is inserted among the ‘ principal parts,’ just after the
present tense, unless the verb is of the First or Variable-vowel
class. A hyphen prefixed to a tense signifies that the tense occurs
only in compounds. The parts of a compound verb are not given
if the simple verb occurs in its proper place in this Dictionary.

The form of the genitive is given for substantives of the A-
declension, the gender is indicated in the O-declension, and both
genitive and gender are given in the Consonant-declension.

The derivation of the word is indicated in square brackets just
before the definition. When the root or word given in these
brackets is in heavy-face letter, refer to the Groups of Related
Words alphabetically arranged (p. 247 ff.). If a word is given in
light-face type in these brackets, without further statement, refer
to that word in its proper alphabetical place in the body of the
Dictionary. If no square brackets occur, the derivation of the
word is unknown or its etymological connexion is doubtful. Eng-
lish cognate words are printed in small capitals, English borrowed
words in heavy-face letter. (See p. 247.)

For information in regard to the illustrations, see p. 243 ff.
