These 2000 peltasts included the
500 yuurAres and 200 roférarc men-
tioned in i. 2. 3, 9. The same
contrast of light-armed troops,
designated as peltasts, with heavy-

10, 10. 7, equal to 7d medracTiKdy
in i. 8. 5, where all the light-armed
troops of Cyrus are meant, ili. 3.

γυμνῆτες is equivalent to the pre-
ceding meAraoral), v. 2. 4, vi. 2. 16,
Vil. 1. 23, 3. 44 (ef. vil. 3.37). Cf
also v. 8. 5.

consisted of a wooden frame cov-

was covered wholly or in part
with bronze, v. 2.29. In shape it
was either elliptical or crescent
shaped, generally the latter, to
judge from representations of it in
works of art. This was the form

barian tribes, vi. 1. 9. The text

 

in ii, 1. 6 is probably corrupt,
since there is no evidence that any
of the Persian troops were armed
with ré\rac. In i. 10, 12 πέλτη is
