This plain is believed by many to
have given its name to the conti-
nent. Ephesus was the most con-
venient landing place for Greeks
and Romans coming to Asia, and
from here Xenophon started to
join Cyrus, vi. 1.25. It was not,
however, of great commercial im-
portance before the time of Al-
exander, nor did it take a promi-
nent part in wars. It was re-
nowned as a sacred city, contain-
ing the famous temple of the
Ephesian Artemis, the largest of
Greek temples and one of the won-
ders of the world, v. 3.12. This,
however, was the second temple,
the first having been burned on
the very night, it was said, when
Alexander was born. The present
ruins at Ajasluk are those of the
suburb of the city, for Ephesus it-
self lay on the hill Prion or Pyon.
The remains of the temple lie be-
tween Ajasluk and this hill.
