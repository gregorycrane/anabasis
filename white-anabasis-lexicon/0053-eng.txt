BiBAos, 7 [cf Eng. Bible, b/b/i0-
graphy], properly the cellular sub-
stance of the stem (not the inner
layers of bark, as it is often erro-
neously stated) of the Egyptian
BvBXos, Or papyrus (an endogenous
plant), from which the papyrus-
paper was made on which Greek
and Latin ‘books’ were written.
Hence BiBro yeypaumévar, manir-
scripts, books, vil. 5.14. The pith
of the papyrus was cut into thin
strips, which were placed one by
the side of the other on a wetted
board. A second layer was placed
on these crosswise, and the whole
was submitted to pressure, and
afterwards smoothed. The gluti-
nous nature of the pith was gener-
ally sufficient to make the two
layers adhere. The pages: thus
manufactured were pasted together
at the longer edges, so as to form
a continuous strip. The writing
was in columns, one column to
each page, with a space between
the pages. Only one side of the
strip was written on, and the strip
was formed into a roll with the
written side inward. These rolls
were sometimes of great length.
