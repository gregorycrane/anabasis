κρωβύλος, ὁ, the krobulos, a way
of arranging the hair, a sort of top-
knot or crest formed by drawing
all the hair to the crown and there
confining it in a knot. This was
old-fashioned for men in the time
of Xenophon, but the hair was still
worn so by children. In y. 4. 13
the name is applied to a horsehair
crest or tuft of leather on the hel-
mets of the Mossynoeci.

Kryoias, ov, Ctesias, a famous
physician of Cnidus, belonging to
the Asclepiad guild there. He was
taken prisoner by the Persians
about 415, and on account of his
skill was appointed body physician
to Darius II. and afterwards to
Artaxerxes. He attended the lat-
ter at Cunaxa, i. 8. 26, 27. He re-
mained at the court 17 years, when
in 398 he was sent home by the
king on an embassy to Evagoras
and Conon, and never returned to
Persia. He wrote a history of
Persia in 23 books and a descrip-
tion of India in one book, of both
of which we have only epitomes,
made by Photius, and a few frag-
ments.

κυβερνήτης, οὐ [κυβερνάω, steer,
cf. Eng. govern}, one who steers,
helmsman, VY. 8.20. The κυβερνή-
τὴς was the most important officer
in the Greek ship. He not only
steered the vessel, a difficult and
delicate operation in case of the
man-of-war in action (see s.v. Tpi}-
pns), but he also gave the orders
which were passed on to the rowers.
He had an assistant, called πρῳρεύς
(q.v.), Who stood at the bow of
the boat as lookout, and was in
constant communication with him.
For the steering gear of the Greek
ship, see s.v. mndaddiov. For illus-
trations of the xuBepyjrns at the
rudder, see s.v. vads and mwevrynKor-
τορος.

Kdvos, 6, the Cydnus, a river in
Cilicia which rose in the Taurus
range and flowed through the city
of Tarsus, i. 2, 23 (Tersus Tchai).

κυζικηνός, ὁ [Κύζικος], a Cyzt-
céne, a gold coin of Cyzicus of
about twice the weight of the da-
ric (see s.v. dapeckés), but so alloyed
that in the time of Demosthenes
it had the value of only 28 Attic
drachmas (see s.v. oe v. 6. 23, vi.
2. Aw Nils 2) 1005 53-01

Κύζικος, ἡ ἡ; Lae (Balkiz), vii.
2.5, a colony of the Milesians, on
the southern shore of the island
Arctonnésus, in the southern part
of the Propontis. This island is
now a peninsula, but in antiquity
two bridges spanned the strait with
a fine harbour on each side of
them. The position of the city
made it important, and its posses-
sion was therefore often hotly con-
tended for, especially in the battle
won there by the Athenians in
410 n.c. Since it was a station on
the way to the grain districts, its
coinage was current among the
Greeks (see Kufixnvds). Under the
Romans the city reached its height
of prosperity, and the ruins on the
hills above the peninsula are of
that period.
