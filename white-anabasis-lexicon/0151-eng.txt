Mévav, wos, 6, Menon, a Thes-
salian adventurer, one of the com-
manders of Cyrus’s Greek force.
In his youth he was a favourite
of Aristippus of Larissa, who gave
him the command of the merce-
naries whom Menon brought to
help Cyrus, ii. 6. 28, 1.2.6; he was
employed by Cyrus to escort home
the Cilician queen, i. 2. 20 ff., and
won favour by being the first to
cross the Euphrates, i. 4. 18 ff.;
he commanded the left wing at
Cunaxa, i. 8. 4. With the other
generals he was seized, ii. 5. 31 ff.,
but not beheaded as they were,
but tortured to death, ii. 6.29. He
was probably guilty of treachery
towards the Greeks with his friend
Ariaeus, ii, 4. 15, 5. 28. An un-
favourable account of his charac-
ter is given in il. 6. 21 ff
