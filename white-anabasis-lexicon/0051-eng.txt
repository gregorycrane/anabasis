BaBvaev, dvos, [ Babel, the
gate of God], Babylon, i. 4. 11,
5. 5, ii. 2. 6, 4. 12, ili. 5. 15, one of
the oldest and most famous cities
of antiquity. Its origin is un-
known. It was the capital of the
province of the same name aa early
as the Elamite conquest, B.c. 2800.
After the 15th century, when As-
syria became the controlling power
in the Tigris-Euphrates region, the
city was conquered at various
times by Assyrian kings and fin-
ally by Sennacherib (first part of
the 7th century), who dealt its
prosperity a heavy blow. With
the fall of Nineveh and the rise
of the new Babylonian empire
(z.c. 606), it entered on a career
of unprecedented splendour. It
was rebuilt and beautified by Nabo-
polassar, his son Nebuchadnezzar,
and their successors down to the
last native king, Nabonidas. It
survived the conquests of Cyrus
the Great (539 n.c.) and of Alex-
ander (331 B.c.) ; its last king was
the Seleucid Antiochus the Great
(224-187 B.c.). In Pliny’s time
it was a ruin, and has so contin-
ued until to-day. Herodotus (who
probably and rightly included Ba-
sippa in his measurement) de-
scribes it as a square, each side of
which was 120 stadia long. Its
hanging-garden, built by Nebu-
chadnezzar for his Median queen,
was reckoned one of the wonders
of the world. The ruins of Baby-
lon (which represent the city of

been in part excavated, and nu-
merous inscriptions have been
found, from which and from As-
syrian inscriptions its history has
been to some extent recovered.

BaPvarwvia, as | BaBvAwnos], Ba-
bylonia, the district in which Baby-
lon was situated, i.7.1. It wasa
plain, watered by the Tigris and
Euphrates and bounded on the
north by Mesopotamia, and ex-
tending to the Persian gulf on the
south. The famous Median wall
was intended as a barrier against
foes from the north. The natural
fertility of the plain was increased
by means of canals from the
rivers.
