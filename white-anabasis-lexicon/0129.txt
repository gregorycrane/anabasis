part, To [cf. Lat. cornu, horn, Eng.
HORN, HART, rhino-ceros|, horn,
prop. of an animal, Lat. cornu ;
hence, from the resemblance of
shape or because horns of animals
were originally used for these pur-
poses, bugle horn, horn, used to
sound ‘taps,’ ii. 2. 4, and among
the barbarians for other purposes,
Vii. 3. 82, 4.19. The cddrmyé, q.v.,
was the instrument employed by
the Greeks in war for signals of
every description, and the use of
the ‘horn’ in ii. 2. 4 in giving a
military signal cannot be paralleled
in the writings of any other Greek
historian than Xenophon. As used
among the barbarians, the instru-
ment was probably the actual horn
of an animal. In vii. 4. 19, it is
worthy of note that the person who
blows on the xépas is called by
Xenophon a σαλπικτής, which in-
dicates that the xépas was used
among the barbarians as was the
oa\rvyé among the Greeks. Among
the Romans the cornu developed
into a regular instrument, as shown
