By this term the Greeks also
designated the place for foot races,
immodpouos (q.v.) being the name
of the enclosure for horse races.
The two were similar in shape, but
the stadium was both shorter and
narrower than the hippodrome.
The accompanying cut represents
the ground plan of the stadium at
Messéne in Peloponnésus. By aa
is designated the level space where
the races were run, through which
a brook now flows; bb mark the
seats of the spectators on the nat-
ural slope of two hills, continued
at hh by a semicircular range of
stone seats. Outside the seats ran
colonnades, cece (projected at ἐΐ

at the upper end a square space

at the extreme upper limit by a
double colonnade e. This double

The distance from the starting
point near an altar (see s.v. Bays)
to the finish (these points are not
marked on the plan) was 600
Greek feet, or a stadium, equal at
Athens to 582 ft. 6 in. English.
But the stadium at Olympia was
longer, the Olympic foot being
greater than the Attic. These
points were each marked by a
square stone pillar, and halfway
between these was a third. On
the first pillar, at the start, was in-
scribed the word dpforeve, ‘ Win!’,
on the second, o7edde, ‘ Faster !’,
on the third, at the goal, kduyor,
‘Turn!’ The straight-away race,
from start to finish, was called στά-
duov or dpouos (about 200 yards),
and might be run by boys, iv. 8. 27.
Double this distance, the runner
turning at the goal and coming
back to the starting point, was
called the δίαυλος. The longest
