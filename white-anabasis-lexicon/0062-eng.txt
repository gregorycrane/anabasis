Aedrgot, oi, Delphi (Castri),
city in Phocis, on the southern
slope of Parnassus and renowned
for its oracle of Apollo, for the
Pythian games, and for its temple
filled with the richest treasures of
art and wealth, iii. 1. 5, v. 3. 5, vi. 1.
22. It was regarded by the Greeks
as the centre of Hellenic civiliza-
tion, and even called the navel of
the whole earth. The city itself
lay in a deep valley between Mt.
Parnassus and Mt. Cirphis, and ex-
tended like an amphitheatre to the
river Pleistus. The great temple
was situated on the rock above;
in its sanctuary was the chasm in
the earth from which issued the

vapour which was thought to in-
spire the oracles; over the chasm
was placed the colossal tripod on
which sat the priestess, called the
Pythia. On the road to the tem-
ple was the Castalian spring. The
existence of a modern town on the
site has hitherto prevented exca-
vations to any extent. The ora-
cle was abolished by Theodosius,
A.D. 390.
