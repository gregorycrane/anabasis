by men and by women, Vii. 3. 27,
5. 5, and its shape was the same
for both sexes. It was a rectan-
gular piece of drapery, one end
of which was gathered about the
left arm and shoulder, and there
held in place by the left hand. The
other end was then carried across
the back to the right, brought either
under or over the right shoulder,
and thrown across the front of the
body over the left shoulder. But in
the house it was
either thrown off
altogether, or
else it dropped
loosely about
the person. See

prevailing colour of the himation
was white, but it is a mistake to
suppose that other colours, brown,
saffron, red, were not common.
The ordinary material of the gar-
ment was wool, the weight vary-
ing according to the season of the
