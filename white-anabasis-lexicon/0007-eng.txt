PREFACE.

Tus Dictionary has not been compiled from other vocabularies
and lexicons, but has been made from the Anabasis itself, on the
basis of an independent collection and examination of all the
places where each word occurs. The editors have aimed to give
all words found in the principal editions of the Anabasis now in
use, including Dindorf’s fourth edition and Hug’s recension of
the Teubner text, as well as the editions of Kriger, Vollbrecht,
Rehdantz and Cobet, and Goodwin and White’s edition of the first
four books.

In the definitions, they have intended to give all the meanings
that each word has in the Anabasis, beginning, when possible, with
the etymological meaning, and passing through the simpler varia-
tions to the more remote. Each meaning or group of meanings is
supported by at least one citation. The number of citations given,
except in the case of conjunctions, particles, pronouns, and prepo-
sitions, is determined by the importance of the word as shown by
the frequency of its occurrence in the Anabasis. When a word
is of common occurrence in all the books (as "EAAnv and épyo-
pat), this is indicated by a row of one or more citations from
each book. But a few words, like xaraxaive, though not common,
are cited at length because their treatment in lexicons has been
defective. Under each word the first passage in which it occurs is
always cited. When but one citation is made for a word, that
word is found only once in the Anabasis.

In treating of the derivation of words, special attention has been
given to their connexion with one another and with related words
in Latin and English. Because of the importance of this subject,
etymological explanations have for the most part been removed
from the body of the Dictionary, and added at the end in the form
