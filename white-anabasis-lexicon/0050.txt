11. 50. νι ys ‘Achaia was
the country lying along the north-

ternal prosperity, but had but little
influence outside and held aloof
from Hellenic affairs until after
the death of Alexander, when they
formed the Achaean League. In
the Heroic Age they were the
ruling nation in Peloponnésus,
and accordingly Homer calls the
Greeks collectively Achaeans. They
formed with the Arcadians over
one-half of the Ten Thousand, vi.
