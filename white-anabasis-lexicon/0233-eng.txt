The trireme had reached its most
perfect form in the time of Xeno-
phon. It was distinguished from
the war vessels that preceded it in
the development of shipbuilding
by the number of its banks of
oars, The revrnxérropos (q.v.) had
a single bank of oars on each side,
the bireme had two banks on each
side ranged one above the other,
the trireme, as the name implies,
had three. We have unfortunately
no representations of triremes on
Greek vases, but from inscriptions
and from passages in ancient an-
thors it is established that the tri-
reme was long and narrow, that
she was a ram, that she was pro-
pelled in action by rowers ranged
obliquely one above another in
banks, and that she was also pro-
vided with two masts and with
sails for voyaging. The position
of the rowers, of whom it has been
estimated there were 174 (31 in
each of the highest banks, 29 in
each of the middle banks, and 27
in each of the lowest banks) was
probably that represented in the
accompanying cut. According to
this represen-
tation each
rower was al-
lowed 8 square
feet of space,
but the oblique
arrangement
of the rowers
above one an-
other, the man
in the highest bank being nearest
the stern, made the perpendicular
distance occupied by the three
rowers in any oblique range only
8 feet. On the stroke the head
and shoulders of the rower came

back between the legs of the man
next above and behind him, on
the recover he came to an upright
position.

The trireme was a wooden ves-
sel, and when not in commission
was hauled out of the water and
housed, vil. 1.19, 27. Some con-
clusions about the speed of the
trireme can be gathered from Vi.
4. 2, where it is stated that the
distance from Byzantium to Hera-
cléa could be made by a trireme
under oars (kwmais) in a day, but
that it was a very long day’s voy-
age. This is a distance of about
150 nautical miles. If the day is
reckoned at 15 hours, we get a
pace of 10 knots an hour; but
there is nothing in the language in
the passage cited to preclude the
supposition that the vessel had
also set her sails. Since the tri-
reme was a ram, the number of
mariners or fighting men on board
was small. In action her manoeu-
vres were performed with great
skill, the chief responsibility rest-
ing on the kuBepynrys (q.v.). The
total crew, including rowers, ma-
rines, sailors, and officers, is esti-
mated at 220.
