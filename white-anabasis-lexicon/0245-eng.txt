nally the whole interior of Asia
Minor west of the Halys, forming
one of the oldest kingdoms in Asia.
Conquered by the Lydian kings
about 620 B.c., it afterwards be-
came, with their kingdom, a Per-
sian province under the name of
Phrygia the Great or Greater Phry-
gia, i. 2.6,7,9.7. Afterwards the
northern and eastern borders were
conquered by the Bithynians, Ga-
latians, and Lycaonians, and the
remainder was annexed to the
kingdom of Pergamon, and finally
in 90 B.c. to the Roman province of
Asia. The name Phrygia Minor
or Lesser Phrygia was applied by
the Greeks to the southern coast of
the Propontis, because they found
it subject to the Phrygians at their
first acquaintance with it. It is
referred to in v. 6, 24, vi. 4. 24.
