THE TEN THOUSAND GREEKS 17

salute him as king. Artaxerxes meanwhile, having no antago-
nist before him, since Cyrus’s line was not long enough to reach
even to the center of his vast force, began to wheel his right
round to encircle his foe. To prevent this maneuver, Cyrus
with his bodyguard of 600 horse rushed upon the 6000 horse
who guarded the king and put them to rout. Many of his
guard pursued the fugitives, leaving Cyrus in the midst of the
enemy with only a handful of his most trusty men, the so-called
“Table Companions,” about him. Presently he caught sight
of his brother. In a perfect transport of hate, casting all
prudence to the winds, he darted furiously upon him and in-
flicted a slight wound with his lance. But the odds were
against him, and soon, being himself hit and falling from his
horse, he was slain with all his companions. This settled the
struggle, for, although the Greeks were again victorious in a
skirmish, the native army of Cyrus fled, and his camp was
pillaged.

The Return Journey of the Greeks

16. It was not until the next morning that the Greeks learned
of the death of Cyrus. This news filled them with dismay.
Nevertheless, putting on a brave front, they offered to make
Ariaeus, the commander of Cyrus’s native army, king of Persia.
Knowing that the nobles would never consent to be ruled by
a man of his social rank, he refused to fight for the crown,
declaring that he meant to start for the coast on the next morn-
ing and offering to take the Greeks with him. They accepted
his offer, having previously refused to surrender their arms at
the king’s demand.

17. On their first day’s march together they saw evidences
that the king’s army was not far distant. Heralds came the
following morning to propose a truce, and guides, sent by the
king, conducted them to villages where they obtained quarters

for several days in the midst of plenty.
