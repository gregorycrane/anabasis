#282 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS (1, 7

84, 27. ὑμῶν: partitive depending on ἑκάστῳ; it is made emphatic
by its position, and refers only to those Greek officers who were present.
— 

καί: as well. 

85, I. στέφανον: a military decoration, like the modern medal. — 

οἱ
δέ: refers to those included in ὑμῶν, 84, 27.

85, 3. ἐξήγγελλον : cp. ἀπήγγελλον, 83, 18, and note the difference
between the two words.

85, 7. παρεκελεύοντο: denotes repetition. — 

πάντες ὅσοιπερ: every
man who (lit., all, just as many as).

85, 8. μὴ μάχεσθαι: z.¢. in person. The tactics of the Greeks, as of
modern warfare, aimed to protect the commander from injury, while the
Persian custom required the commander to be in front. In this request
the Greeks were not wholly unselfish. If Cyrus were slain, what was
to become of them, and who would carry out his fine promises? —

τάττεσθαι: middle. According to Plutarch (Life of Artaxerxes, 8) Cyrus
answered: “ What say you, Clearchus? Do you urge me, aiming, as I
do, at the royal power, to show myself unworthy of it?”

85, 10. Οἴει γάρ: do you really think ?

85, 11. Νὴ Δί᾽: cp. μὰ τοὺς θεούς, 71:1, 8. ---

85, 14. ἐγένετο: amounted to.

85,15. ἀσπίς: shield, i.e. hoplites; the singular is used as we say
‘forty sail,’ ‘thirty head of cattle.’ There is an unexplained discrep-
ancy between the numbers given here and previously (58, 13 ff., 63, 
7-13, 69, 18-23).

85, 19. τὰ εἴκοσι : on the article, see on 58, 16.

85, 20. ἐλέγοντο : see on 57, 4.

how best to render their Persian title.
