1, 7] NOTES 279

apooeraxOy: impersonal, the command was given; the subject is ro
ἐξάγειν, supplied from éfjyov, but its omission is as natural in Greek as
in English.

83, 2. mwpooextdvouw: expresses customary past action. The act con-
sisted in touching the ground with the forehead and kissing the earth ;
see Daniel 2. 46, 1 Samuel 20. 41.

83, 3. καίπερ: οἴξη used with a concessive participle.! — ἐπὶ θάνατον:
accusative with a verb of motion; cp. émi Oavarw, 82, 27.

83, 6. otre... odSels: for the double negative, see on 68, 25. — τεθνη-
xéta: the perfect participle denotes a state resulting from a completed
act; see on éLevypevy, etc., 56, Io.

83, 7. Srws dré0avev: Herodotus (7. 114) states that it was a Per-
sian custom to execute by burying alive. It is not improbable that
this method was adopted here. Possibly the rank and influence of
Orontas, which had made it prudent to have a strong Greek guard at
his trial, also rendered a secret execution advisable. — el8as: from
actual knowledge.

83, 12. CHAPTER 7. vé«ras: plural to denote the separate watches
of the night. — é&6xe: he thought.—es...tw: at the next dawn. ἕως
forms its accusative without ν.3

83, 13. paxovpevov: implies purpose.

83, 14. Sefiod: see on defidv, 59, 26. For the battle it is Clearchus
who holds this post of danger and distinction, while for a parade (59,
22 ff.) it fell to Menon, possibly indicating that in the meantime Clear-
chus had risen in the estimation of Cyrus and that Menon had fallen.
For the position of the Greek hoplite force at the beginning of the battle,
see D on the plan, p. go. For the genitive deftov, see on dv, 69, 20.

83, 17. hpépqg: dative of association expressing time.®

83, 20. Aoxayovs : inasmuch as the captains of the mercenaries assisted
in raising their own troops (see Introd. § 56), they had much greater
influence, both with their men and with the commanding officer to
whom they sold their services, than is normally enjoyed by the modern
captain.

83, 21. was ἂν..... ποιοῖτο : how he should fight, etc.; he said, ras
ἂν . . . wovoiuny, potential optative.
