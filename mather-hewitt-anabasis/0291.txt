#279

προσετάχθη: impersonal, the command was given; the subject is τὸ
ἐξάγειν, supplied from ἐξῆγον, but its omission is as natural in Greek as
in English.

83, 2. προσεκύνουν: expresses customary past action. The act con-
sisted in touching the ground with the forehead and kissing the earth ;
see Daniel 2. 46, 1 Samuel 20. 41.

83, 3. καίπερ: often used with a concessive participle.1 — ἐπὶ θάνατον:
accusative with a verb of motion; cp. ἐπὶ θανάτῳ, 82, 27.

83, 6. οὔτε... οὐδείς: for the double negative, see on 68, 25. — τεθνη-
κότα: the perfect participle denotes a state resulting from a completed
act; see on ἐζευγμένη, etc., 56, 10.

83, 7. ὅπως ἀπέθανεν: Herodotus (7. 114) states that it was a Per-
sian custom to execute by burying alive. It is not improbable that
this method was adopted here. Possibly the rank and influence of
Orontas, which had made it prudent to have a strong Greek guard at
his trial, also rendered a secret execution advisable. — εἰδώς: from
actual knowledge.

CHAPTER 7. 

83, 12. 

νύκτας: plural to denote the separate watches
of the night. — 


ἐδόκει: he thought.

εἰς... ἕω: at the next dawn. ἕως
forms its accusative without ν.2

83, 13. μαχούμενον: implies purpose.

83, 14. δεξιοῦ: see on δεξιόν, 59, 26. For the battle it is Clearchus
who holds this post of danger and distinction, while for a parade (59,
22 ff.) it fell to Menon, possibly indicating that in the meantime Clear-
chus had risen in the estimation of Cyrus and that Menon had fallen.
For the position of the Greek hoplite force at the beginning of the battle,
see D on the plan, p. 90. For the genitive δεξιοῦ, see on ὧν, 69, 20.

83, 17. ἡμέρᾳ: dative of association expressing time.3

83, 20. λοχαγούς : inasmuch as the captains of the mercenaries assisted
in raising their own troops (see Introd. § 56), they had much greater
influence, both with their men and with the commanding officer to
whom they sold their services, than is normally enjoyed by the modern
captain.

83, 21. πῶς ἂν..... ποιοῖτο : how he should fight, etc.; he said, πῶς
ἂν . . . ποιοίμην, potential optative.
