236 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS fl, 1

54, 3. abrév, pioOdv : double accusative with a verb of asking!; both
are direct objects; cp. carpdayy, 51, 6.— els . . . S€vous: since Cyrus
would hardly have been willing to send to such a distance as Thessaly
troops which he had at hand, already assembled in Asia, it seems best to
take closely with proOov not only rp@v pnvav but also eis . . . §€vovus,
pay for 2000 mercenaries (and) for three months (cp. ¢is, 53, 24) ; that
