THE ARMY OF CYRUS 47

chus himself was pelted on one occasion with stones when he
tried to force his division to advance contrary to their wishes,
and at another time he had a narrow escape from death at the
hands of Menon’s men, who were angry with him for striking
one of their number. At Tarsus two generals were deserted by
2000 of their men, who attached themselves to a more popular
commander.

On the retreat, when it became necessary to choose new
generals to take the places of those who had fallen ‘victims to
the treachery of Tissaphernes, the selection was made by the
captains, but the soldiers, who were immediately afterwards
called together to discuss plans for their future course, practi-
cally ratified the choice by voting to obey the new officers. On

,all measures proposed during the retreat the soldiers were asked

to express their opinions, and finally to vote for acceptance or
rejection by a show of hands, as in a popular assembly. The
generals were at times called to account by the soldiers, and
more than once after they left ‘Trapezus even Xenophon was
obliged to defend himself against bitter accusations.

In times of their greatest danger, however, the Greeks of
Cyrus’s army were obedient to authority, patient and coura-
geous, and although occasionally, especially in their journey from
Trapezus along the coast, they were no better than freebooters,
yet they showed themselves in general humane to their captives,
loyal to each other, and faithful in their worship of the gods.
