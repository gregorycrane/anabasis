#240 XENOPHON’'S ANABASIS [1,2

the pretense of a campaign against Pisidia. — σταθμούς: accusative of
extent. For the average day’s march in the first two books of the
Anabasis, see Introd. § 64.

56, 9. εὖρος: 56. ἦν. --- πλέθρα : the pupil should familiarize himself
with the English equivalents of the Greek measures.

56, 10. ἐζενγμένη πλοίοις: formed of boats joined together (lit., yoked
by means of boats). The perfect tense expresses the completed act of
joining and implies the permanence of the result. The boats had been
joined and still were joined. An aorist participle would have expressed
merely the fact that they had been joined.

56, 12. οἰκουμένην: in contrast with the many cities deserted on
account of scarcity of water, attacks from bandits, oppression by gov-
ernors, etc. 

56, 13. ἡμέρας: for the case, cp. σταθμούς, 1. 7.— Μένων: sent by
Aristippus, who had not come himself in answer to the summons
of Cyrus, 55, 1 ff.

56, 14. Δόλοπας, Αἰνιᾶνας: from the southwestern and southern
parts of his own country, while the Olynthians came from Chalcidice, a
district in Macedonia.

56, 18. Κύρῳ: see on αὐτῷ, 53, 2.— ἦν: with a neuter plural sub-
ject,! which, however, as not infrequently, has a singular meaning; cp.
Lat. castra, camp.

56,19. θηρίων: genitive with an adjective of fullness. — ἐκεῖνος ἐθήρευεν :
he used to hunt; see on ἀπεπέμπετο, 52,6. ἐκεῖνος (not ‘that one’) is
used as a personal pronoun.

56, 20. ὁπότε. .. βούλοιτο: a temporal clause depending on a verb
which expresses repeated past action, so equivalent to a past general
condition.2

56, 21. μέσου: in the predicate position means middle of, midst of ; 3
cp. Lat. media aestate, in the middle of summer.

56, 22. αὐτοῦ: the genitive of personal pronouns is always in the
predicate position.4 — ἐκ τῶν βασιλείων: though we translate under the
palace, the stream is thought of as in motion, flowing from under the
palace. — καί: see on 51, 6.
