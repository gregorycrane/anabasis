6 PREFACE

adopted as offering the simplest remedy of a corrupt passage.
Out of deference to tradition the certainly spurious summaries
at the beginning of the second, third, and fourth books have been
retained, but are relegated to the bottom of the page as foot-
notes. All references to the text are made by page and line.

Grammatical references in the Notes have been put at the
foot of the page, following a system which has been tried for
several years and appears to have met with the hearty approval
of teachers and pupils. As a rule, the grammatical principle
to which reference is made is also stated in each case in the
note, thereby relieving conscientious teachers and pupils from
the necessity of looking up a reference if they are already
familiar with the principle in question.

It will be observed that the legends of the illustrations: are
made fuller than is customary. Too often illustrations are re-
garded, not only by pupils, but by teachers as well, as mere en-
tertaining embellishments, inserted without any serious purpose.
It is hoped that in this book, through the detailed explanations,
the educational value of the picture and the interest of the pupil
may be much increased. The immediate source of each illus-
tration may be learned from the list, pages 8 ff.

The note on the eagle, 103, 18, is due to a suggestion of Pro-
fessor Campbell Bonner of the University of Michigan. Valu-
able assistance has been received from the criticisms and
suggestions of Professor Arthur Gordner Leacock and Dr.
Francis Kingsley Ball of the Phillips Exeter Academy, and of
Professor Herbert Weir Smyth, the general editor of the series
in which this book appears.
