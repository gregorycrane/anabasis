#284 XENOPHON'S ANABASIS (1,7

87, 4. ἔτι: at all.

εἰ... οὐ μαχεῖται: this is perhaps a half-ironical
repetition of the seer’s words, retaining the future and the negative οὐ,1
although in a protasis. Translate if he will not fight.— 

ἐν: within. A
genitive, as in l. 3, is the usual construction.

87,5. ἐὰν δ᾽ ἀληθεύσῃς: we might expect a simple present condition,
but the idea is if it shall turn out (in the future) that you are speaking
the truth, if you prove to be telling the truth.

87,6. δέκα τάλαντα: = 60,000 Attic drachmas, or some $10,800 (the
drachma being a silver coin = about 18 cents). 3000 gold darics,
equivalent to about $16,200, were given in payment. The difference in
the values as expressed in our money is due to the change in the pro-
portional values of gold and silver—silver, as used in our coinage,
being worth about two thirds as much, with reference to gold, as in
ancient Greece. — 

ἀπέδωκεν: cp. ἀποδιδόναι, 59, 6, and see note.

87, 8. ἐκώλυε : cp. ἐκώλυεν, 62,9. After all, a narrow passage would
have been a poor place for the Persians to attempt to resist the Greeks,
for they could not have brought into play their only strong point, supe-
riority in numbers. — 

διαβαίνειν: see on κελεύειν, 67, 22.— 

ἔδοξε: the
subject is personal; see on 66, 10.

87,9. ἀπεγνωκέναι: in indirect discourse (see on δοκεῖ, 66, 10), the
tense denoting completion, that he had definitely given up the idea of
fighting. τοῦ μάχεσθαι is the genitive of separation.

87, 10. ἠμελημένως: an adverb formed from a perfect participle. —


μᾶλλον: here the comparative is weaker than its positive and means
rather, somewhat ; see on ἀθυμότερος, 71, 17.

87, 12. τὸ... πολύ: see ON 73, 13.

87, 13. αὐτῷ: translate with τὸ. .. πολύ (see on οὐδένι, 63, 18), the
greater part of his forces. στρατιώταις (1. 14) also may be rendered as
a possessive genitive (with ὅπλων), though, like αὐτῷ, it is really a
dative of interest, αὐτῷ implying disadvantage, στρατιωταις, advantage.

CHAPTER 8. 


87,16. πλησίον: adverb; translate as a predicate adjec-
tive with σταθμός, which here means halting place ; usually it denotes the
distance between two halting places. — 

ἔμελλε: he was intending, expect-
ang; with the infinitive μελλω is sometimes used like the Latin first
periphrastic in -urus, to denote intention or futurity.2 — καταλύειν: for
breakfast. — ἡνίκα: usually the temporal clause defines the time of the
