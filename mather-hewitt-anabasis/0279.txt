ship and such greed for individual gain at a time when concerted action
was essential were quite in accord with Menon’s selfish character. —
ἐλέγετο : personal construction, as is shown by the lack of a subject for
πέμψαι. -

74,14. τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα: (ἢε Greek contingent, except Menon’s
troops, which had already crossed (I. 6).

74,15. tev SiaBawvovrwv: partitive.

74,16. paorév: translate by the singular. — td rod ποταμοῦ : the
use of the agent construction personifies the river; otherwise the dative
of means would be used. |

74.) 18. γένοιτο: had become, for éyévero of direct discourse ; they hint
that it has become so for his special benefit. — et ph: except. — rére: for
vov of direct discourse.

74, 19. wdolos: on his march to Greece Xerxes had built at this
point a pontoon bridge which had remained in use until Abrocémas
burned it. — κατέκαυσεν : 5ε6 Οἡ ἐποίησε, 51, 6.

74,) 2ο. ἵνα. .. διαβῇ: ἴΠ6 τηοοὐ οὗ Α.᾽5 actual thought is retained
after a past tense, where we might have the optative.1 English requires
might (not may) cross.—@eov: predicate, a special providence, the
implied subject being the low water. A second subject of édcoxee is
ὑποχωρῆσαι τὸν ποταμόν, and that the river, etc. (see on doxei, 66, 10).

74) 21. Κύρῳ ὡς βασιλεύσοντι : ἀδίϊνε οὗ interest, 2 honor of Cyrus,
because he was destined to be king; ws shows that the idea expressed
by the participle was held by the river or by the god who controlled its
waters. The statement of the Thapsacenes, as reported by Xenophon,
must be regarded as a piece of Oriental flattery, since in the late autumn
and early winter the river is often fordable. It is to be remembered,
however, that the Greeks crossed between the middle and the end
of July, at a time when the river is usually at flood height. From
the end of May until towards the middle of July the waters stand
about thirteen feet above low water (Rogers, //7story of Babylonia
and Assyria, 1, 274). The conduct of Abrocdmas, content with
burning the boats, although it is likely that when he was there the
river was already fordable, since he was not many days ahead of
Cyrus, is an indication that he, like Syennésis, was trimming between
the rival brothers.

74, 27. tweoirlravro: they were entering upon the Arabian desert.
