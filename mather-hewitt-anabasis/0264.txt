#252 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1.3
other modifier of the omitted subject is in the nominative.1 — ὅπου ἂν ὦ:
as secondary protasis to ἂν εἶναι, this would naturally be less vivid also,
ὅπου εἴην. To secure greater vividness, the subjunctive with ἂν is used
instead, may be for might be. —ὑμῶν: genitive of separation.

65, 11. ὦν: that the participle implies condition is shown by the ἄν
of the following clause. The complete condition in direct discourse
would be εἰ εἴην ἔρημος, οὐκ ἂν ἱκανὸς εἴην. — ἂν. .. εἶναι: as in l. 10.
Note the repetition of ἄν2 after οὔτ᾽... οὔτ᾽; it still belongs with εἶναι.

ὅ5, 12. ὠφελῆσαι, ἀλέξασθαι : with an adjective. — ὡς: introduces the
genitive absolute, which takes the place of a participle in indirect dis-
course after οὕτω τὴν γνώμην ἔχετε (equivalent ἰο γιγνώσκετε τοῦτο),
make up your minds to this, that, etc. (lit., in the belief (as) that, etc.,
so make up your minds).—ἐμοῦ... ἰόντος: genitive absolute with
future force; translate I shall go; cp. ἰέναι, 64, 4, and see note.

65, 13. ὅπῃ ἂν καὶ ὑμεῖς : sc. ἴητε. — καί: Zoo, too, translate only by
emphasis upon ὑμεῖς.

65, 14. αὐτοῦ: intensive with ἐκείνου, his own.

65, 15. ταῦτα: explained by the clause in indirect discourse, ὅτε...
πορεύεσθαι, and best omitted in translating. — οὐ φαίη... πορεύεσθαι:
said he was not going (cp. οὐκ ἔφασαν ἰέναι, 64, 4, said they would not
go), refused to go. —παρά: to, not against (cp. ἐπί, πρός). Note the
three uses of παρά, ll. 15-18.

65, 17. πλείους: nominative.3

65, 19. τούτοις: dative of cause. — μετεπέμπετο: note the tense.

65, 21. στρατιωτῶν: genitive of separation with an adverb.4 — θαρ-
ρεῖν: the infinitive is used with λέγω and εἶπον, when they signify tell or
bid. — ὡς... δέον: because, as he said (see on 52, 16), this matter
would turn out all right; δέον is a participle used as a substantive; cp.
φεύγοντας, 52, 25.

65, 22. μεταπέμπεσθαι : to keep sending for him.

65, 23. αὐτός: for himself, intensifying the omitted subject of ἰέναι
(see on τίμιος, 1. 10) ; ἰέναι is future in meaning, as in 64, 4.

65, 24. θ᾽:  = τε:
65, 25. ἄλλων: partitive. — τὸν βουλόμενον: any one who wished.
66,1. τὰ... Κύρον. .. πρὸς ἡμᾶς : the relation of Cyrus to us.
