63, 19. &Oetv: he said 7AGov.

63, 20. Kupe lévar: sc. eis xetpas.—h: Ais, Cp. Tov, 51, 3.

63, 21. trace: for a finite mood with zpiv, see on xpiv dv ; . . coupe
BovAcionrat, 54, 7; the indicative is used of a definite past act.

63, 22. &aPe: the context makes it clear that Syennésis is the
subject. If there were room for doubt, the new subject would be
expressed.

63, 25. wapd Bactdet: af court; see on Bacrr€ws, 52, 6. :

63, 27. xpvoodv (with dxiwaxynv): gold-mounted. The first three
presents mentioned here could be given only by the king (see Cyropae-
dia 8. 2. 8). Cyrus was thus playing the king already. — oroAhv
Tlepouxhy: probably the xavdvs, a long silk robe with sleeves. See
Fig. 2, p. 18.

64, 1. SvaprdterGar: in the same construction as the preceding accu-
satives (cp. d06jva1, 53, 4), and the assurance that his country should
not again be plundered. Ue had in mind the looting of Tarsus. — qv

Eng. “I am going,” “are you going?” etc., which refer to the future more
often than to the present). In 1. 7 and in mpoievar, |. 9, the infinitive is
not in indirect discourse, and so has no idea of time; see on wapayeve-
oa, 54, 11. — rot wpéow: genitive of place.”

64, 5. trémrevov: their suspicions were now brought to a head,
because to reach Pisidia from Tarsus they would have to fetrace their
steps and march west. — lévat, pro@w0fAvac: observe that, unlike the
usage of Latin, the subject of an infinitive in indirect discourse is
