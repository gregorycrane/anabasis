248 XENOPHON'’S ANABASIS [1, 2

63, 5. ZéAoug: originally a Greek colony, and hence it had nothing to
fear. —’Ieaots: near the scene of Alexander’s great battle with the Per-
sians in 333 B.c. The inhabitants of these two towns remained to trade
with the fleet and army. Such plurals as these and Tapoovs (62, 25)
are thought to be the name of the inhabitants applied to the city.

63, 6. wporépa: adjective equivalent to an English adverb; see on
éxovoa, 53, 26.— Ktpov: genitive of comparison with aporépa.?

63,7. npéparcs: dative of degree of difference.”

63, 8. Adxot: the Adyxos consisted normally of one hundred men (In-
trod. § 56), but it seems here that the two missing Aoxo together con-
tained only that number (see |. 12). Perhaps the Aoyot were not full,
or possibly éxawros should be read before éxarov, one hundred each.

63,9. of pev. . . of 5€: see on 52, 24. —dpwafovrds te: circumstan-
tial participle of time and cognate accusative, while engaged in some act
of depredation. — karaxorfivar: cp. the construction after @yyc® with
that after A€yw, 62, 12.

with cad, 1. 15.

63, 14. Stffpwacav: an act not authorized by Cyrus and probably dis-
continued on his arrival.

63, 16. pereméurero: the tense denotes repetition.

63,17. wpds daurév: to his presence. — obre... tpn: the ov of ovre,
though grammatically belonging with édy, goes in sense with the infini-
tive, sad that he had not before up to this time come, etc.; cp. the use
of Lat. zegd, as negat sé... posse, he says that he cannot, Caesar, Gal-
lic War 1.8. Translate ovre... ovre, etc., he said that he had not...
and he did not wish either. 7Oede is in the same construction as épy.

63, 18. mpérepov: superfluous with zw. — otSevl: being a compound
negative, it does not make an affirmative with ovre, but strengthens the
negation.4 Translate the dative ® as a possessive genitive, of anybody,
with eis yetpas. — éavrod: see on Kupov, |. 6.
