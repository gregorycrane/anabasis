1, 3] : NOTES 253

66, 2. SAov [€orivy] Sri: often equivalent to an adverb and printed
as one word, dyAovéri. — obras txer. . . domep: 25 precisely the same as;
for €yw with an adverb instead of eid with an adjective, see on etvoixa@s
éxouev, 52, 9; ovTws anticipates wazep, which is more precise than ds.

66, 3. tpets: sc. €opev, not a common omission.

66, 5. iptv: dative depending on the idea of giving in pucodorns. —
GScxetoOar: subject omitted because it is the same as that of the princi-
pal verb; see on iévou, etc., 64, 5.

66, 6. adore... WéAw: see On wore .. . Elvat, 52, 7.— peTameproptvov
atrod: the genitive absolute implying concession! is often strength-
ened by xai or xaizep.”

65, 7. rdpéytorrov : adverbial accusative ; so ravra, 1. 8.— alo-yvvdpevos :
from a feeling of shame, circumstantial participle of cause ; so Sedu, |. 8.

. 66, 8. epevopévos: participle in indirect discourse agreeing with the
subject.2 The tense expresses action completed at the time of the main
verb, and in direct discourse would be the perfect indicative.

66, 9. Slenv émOq: sc. wor; an object clause with a verb of fearing.‘
— ov: genitive of cause; the full expression would be dixnv rovrwr & (7
which®) vouiter 7dixnoGo,. On the attraction of the relative to the case
of its omitted antecedent, see on dv@ dv, 64, 24.

66, 10. Soxet: wpa is the subject, the personal construction (see on
Aéyerat AroAXov, 57, 4) being usual with doxéw in the meaning seem,
be thought ; the impersonal construction is often preferable in English, as, _
zt seems to me not tobe atime. The infinitive is the object of doxet and
in indirect discourse (hence the negatives ovy, o8dZ; see on 7, 54, 7)-
With doxet meaning zt seems best an infinitive is the Subject and not i in
indirect discourse. — xabedSav, dpedetv: depend on wpa.®

66, 11. fav airav: genitive with a verb of neglecting.7— 8 vm xpq:
indirect questions are often introduced by the indefinite relative.

66,12. avrot: adverb. — oxerréov : verbal adjective (Lat. vzdendum) in
the impersonal construction.’ Translate zf seems to me that it ts necessary
to consider how, etc. etvaris the subject of doxe? and in indirect discourse.
