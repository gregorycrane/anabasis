FIG. 12.— The contest of Apollo and Marsyas. Victorious Apollo, with the
cithara, is looking scornfully towards Marsyas (the second figure from the left
margin), who appears to be blowing a defiant note on the flute. The patroness of
Marsyas, Athena, armed with shield, helmet, and spear, the last partly broken off,
stands beside him. Between the contestants, intently listening to the music, sits a
Muse. The figure at the right of Apollo, with arm raised as if about to crown him,
is the goddess of victory. The river Marsyas is personified by the old man at her
feet, as the water-jar under his arm and the reed in his right hand indicate. The
next figure to the right is not understood, but beyond him two servants are prepar-
ing to flay Marsyas, one tying him firmly, the other whetting a knife. Relief on a
Roman sarcophagus, found in Tuscany,
