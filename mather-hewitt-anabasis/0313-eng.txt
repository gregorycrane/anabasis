102, 17. éwel: causal. —xard: opposite.

102, 18. edévupov: used as in 101, 22. See plan, p. 103.

102, 21. wepumrifavres: outflanking (lit., folding round).

102, 24. dvanrréccav: fold back the line to a position parallel with
the river. Apparently this maneuver was not executed, as they were
still deliberating upon it (103, 1) when the king changed the direction
of his advance.

102, 25. worfoacGa: fo put.

102, 26. év@: cp. év rovTw, 101, 18.

103, 1. Kal 8) . . . ovwvye: the king had already changed his direc-
tion and brought his line of battle opposite into the same position (lit.,
arrangement) as that in which he had met them for battle the first time;
z.é. instead of continuing in the direction in which he was marching
when the Greeks first noticed him (101, 18-23), which would have
taken him past the Greek line, he seems to have turned obliquely to the
right and approached the river, so that his line of battle, when it halted,
faced the Greeks, was at right angles to the river, and had one flank
protected by it. Of course the greater part of his line extended far
beyond the Greek army, since it was more than twice as long as the
whole force of Cyrus in the first battle (see 93, 19 f. and plan, p. 103).
— 8f,: sometimes, especially with xa/, almost equivalent to 757.

103, 6. 1d wpéoGev: adverbial accusative. For the first attack, see 92,
6 ff.— ad: once more. —te wrbovos: when at (lit., from) a greater dis-
fance from the Greeks than before, z.e. more than a bowshot; see g2, 13.

103, 8. xépyns tivds: perhaps Cunaxa, a village (not mentioned by
name in the Axadas?s) near which Plutarch says the battle was fought.

103, 12. qmefol: predicate, sc. dvres; the king was now surrounded
not by infantry but by cavalry.

103, 13. twwéwv: genitive with a verb of fullness; cp. cirov, 74, 26.

103,15. Gore. . . yryvookev: sc. rovs "EAAnvas as subject. — 7d
arovovpevov: equivalent to the more usual 76 yeyvdpevov. The Persians,
being on the hill, could be easily seen by the Greeks on the plain.

103, 18. alerév Twa... dvarerapévov: a sort of golden eagle ona shield
(as a background) raised aloft upon a pole. Possibly the object thus
vaguely described by the Greeks, who saw the standard only from a
distance, was not an eagle at all, but the upper half of a human figure
partly inclosed by wings, symbolizing the chief deity of the Persians.
See the top of Fig. 2, p. 18 (cp. Fig. 34, p. 95).

103, 22. évrai6’: used as in 54, 22. —84: of course, ironical.
