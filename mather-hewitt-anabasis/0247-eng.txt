Great care should be exercised in the translation of xaé. It is often not
connective, but intensive, z.e. not a conjunction, but an adverb. —

1. 5), but a dative of interest implying advantage, gave him their con-
tributions. — els: of purpose, for, towards.

mar reference, see on wapwy, 51, 5, and observe the different way of
