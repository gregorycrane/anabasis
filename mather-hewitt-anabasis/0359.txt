151) ὃ. αὐτοῖς. . . ἰέναι : fo be on terms of friendship with them
(cp. KAedpxy, 150, 17). :

151, 10. orparnyovs: proleptic accusative (object of ép@vras, used
instead of a nominative subject of rewovOacw) ; see on ἀπήγγειλε. ..
κρίσιν, 81, 17. --- adrots : indirect object, but in 1. 12 it depends on the
preposition of the compound verb.

151, 12. wv: the omitted antecedent is genitive of the crime or
charge! with dixyny, punishment for what.

151, 13. διὰ παντὸς. . . ἰέναι: 20 δὲ at out-and-out war with them;
cp. 1. 8. — σὺν τοῖς Oeots : note how forcibly a dependence on the gods is
expressed by the position of the phrase at the beginning of the clause. -

151, 15. Adyowros: the tense expresses continuance of the act, whzle
he was still speaking. — wrapvvra.: both Greeks and Romans, like the
Germans and some other peoples to-day, considered sneezing a sign
of good luck. Cp. Catullus 45, 8 f., Amor, sinistra ut ante, Dextra
sternuit approbatidnem, Love, as before on the left, now on the right
sneezed his approval; and Tennyson’s allusion in Edwin Morrts :

Shall not Love to me,

As in the Latin song I learnt at school,
Sneeze out a full God-bless-you right and left ?

The Germans exclaim “ Prosit!” ze. Govd luck! when a _ person
sneezes, and the French say, “ Bonne santé!” Good health! In Aris-
totle’s Problemata, 33, it is said in all seriousness that sneezing is a
god, connected with the head, the soundest part of the body, and is a
sign of good health.

151, 17. 6e6v: the god who sent the omen of the sneeze; see l. 18.

151, 18. olwvés: cp. Aristophanes’ joke in the Azrds, 720, mrappov
τ᾽ ὄρνιθα xadeire, you call a sneeze a bird.

151, 19. σωτῆρος: the sneeze was heard just as Xenophon uttered
the word owrnpias (1. 14), so that the omen was naturally referred to
Zeus the Savior. — etfacGat : ¢o vow, followed by the future infinitive in
indirect discourse, like a verb of promising; see on zpodwoev, 150, 21.
The vow was paid at Trapézus (see 224, 18).

151, 24. ératdvicav: for another use of the pzan, which seems
strange to us, see 92, 7, and 103, 5.
