402 XENOPHON'S ANABASIS [4. ὁ

224,13. §éma: in apposition with the objects. It is easy to imagine
the joy of the Greek soldiers upon finding themselves again among
people of their own blood and language. Doubtless, too, many of them
were welcome guests at homes in the city, inasmuch as the stories they
could tell of their adventures since they left Sardis would be full of
interest to their hosts.

224,14. συνδιεπράττοντο: 2:16) joined (with the Colchians) z# nego-

ethical side of Greek games. While strict rules against fouling were
enforced, yet in wrestling spraining an adversary’s fingers or toes and
throttling were allowed; and in boxing, which to be sure was generally
limited to professionals, the force of the blows was increased by strips
of leather wound round the hands, and by the latter part of the fourth
century B.c. nails and pieces of lead were attached to the leather.
