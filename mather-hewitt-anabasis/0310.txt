74,20. Cyrus was particularly fond of horses; see 95, 27 f.

99, 26. μέλλοιεν ὄψεσθαι: were likely to see him, a periphrastic future
as in 87, 16, but observe that here the future infinitive 1 is employed, —
its principal use when not in indirect discourse.

99, 27. τιμᾷ: indicative retained in an indirect question, representing
his thought ‘that I may show whom I honor.’ The relative pronoun is
rarely used to introduce indirect questions.

99, 29. Ἑλλήνων, βαρβάρων: partitive with οὐδένα.

100,1. τεκμήριον δέ: 5.5. ἐστί; the δέ correlates with μέν, 99, 28, the
proof being added to Xenophon’s private judgment. 

δούλου ὄντος:
concessive, slave though he was, see on ἧς, 84, 2.

100, 2. πλήν, etc.: but see 62, 4-6, which shows that Orontas was
not the only one to prove unfaithful to Cyrus.

100, 3. καὶ οὗτος... ἑαντῷ: for the circumstance see 81, 7 f. — οἱ:
see on οἷ, 53, 4.

100, 7. ὄντες: equivalent to the protasis of a less vivid future con-
dition.

100, 8. τιμῆς: for the genitive with τυγχάνειν, see on ἄλλου. . .
Κύρου, 74, 4.

100, 9. τὸ... αὐτῷ γενόμενον: what befell him, subject of an implied
ἐστί; τεκμήριον is predicate.

100, 10. ὅτι: with rexunpiov.

καὶ... καί: not only... but also.

100, 11. τούς: used only once because the three adjectives apply to
only one class of people. — 

ἀποθνήσκοντος : note the tense.

100, 15. ἱππικοῦ: see on αὐτῶν, 53, 5. ---

πεπτωκότα : ἴῃ indirect dis-
