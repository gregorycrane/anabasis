Aedrool, -d», Delphi, a city of central
Greece, famed for the oracle of
Apollo, which was consulted on all
sorts of matters by both Greeks and
foreigners. The importance of the
oracle was diminished in Roman
times, and shortly before 400 A.D.
it was abolished by the emperor
Theodosius the Great. In 1892 the
French began excavations there, the
village of Kastri, which covered the
site, having been removed. Among
the discoveries are the foundations
of the temple of Apollo.
