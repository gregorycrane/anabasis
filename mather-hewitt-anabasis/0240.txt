#228 XENOPHON’'S ANABASIS (4,1

51,3. ἠσθένει : the imperfect denotes the continuance of the state.
Darius was at this time engaged in quelling a revolt in Media.—
ὑπώπτευε: note the augment.! — τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου: the article, as often,
is used for a possessive pronoun, — an end of his life; English prefers
a Clause, as that his life was drawing to an end.

51, 4. τὼ παῖδε: with the dual, cp. παῖδες δύο, 1. 1; here the number
two is emphasized. The accusative is subject of the infinitive.2— ἀμ-
φοτέρω: regularly takes the predicate position. This order of words
gives a colloquial effect, his two sons, both of them. — παρεῖναι: observe
the violation of the rule4 that the accent of verbs is recessive. —
οὖν: now. 

51,5. παρών: supplementary participle, best translated by an infinitive,
happened to be there.5 — μεταπέμπεται: for the reason of the summons,
see Introd. § 1; cp. this genuine historical present with γίγνονται, l. 1.

51,6. ἀρχῆς: for the province of Cyrus, see map (frontispiece) and
Introd. § 3.— σατράπην: predicate accusative, accompanying an object
accusative.® — ἐποίησε: translate as pluperfect. Greek simply refers
the act to the past without stating (as English does) the completeness
of the act in the past. — καί: too; δέ, and, is the connective. — στρατη-
γόν: see on σατράπην, 1.6. Cyrus was appointed to this office when
only seventeen. He superseded Tissaphernes, in whom he found a
rival and a bitter though secret foe; see Introd. § 3.

51, 7. ὅσοι: emphasizes the idea of number already suggested in
πάντων. --- εἰς: in; the Greek point of view is that of place ¢o which,
the English that of place in which. —Καστωλοῦ πεδίον: without the
article, equivalent to a proper name.

51, 8. ἁθροίζονται: not historical present.7—ὁ: the article is fre-
quently used with proper nouns, especially with the names of persons
well known or previously mentioned. —λαβών: the commonest use of
the circumstantial participle.® English uses the present tense, but Greek
is more accurate, the aorist participle expressing simple occurrence and
