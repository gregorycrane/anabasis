169, 12. rére, etc.: and for the time being they led along their com-
panies apart from (t.e. behind) the wings. The wings in Il. 10-13 (as
in 168, 15, 23, 26) are the ends of the front and rear divisions of the
square; see plan, p. 169. It seems to be clearly implied that both divi-
sions received relief from crowding by the falling behind of these six
special companies. Probably three companies marched in the center
of each division (in 174, 12, Chirisophus is said to have three hundred
of the picked men in the front division). In some cases it might be
possible, after the three companies of the front division had fallen
behind and the wings had drawn together, for the passage to be made
without further maneuvers; at other times one wing might be obliged
to march behind the other, and the number of men marching abreast
would depend on the width of the passageway. Behind the wings
would come the three companies, abreast or one behind another ac-
cording to circumstances, followed by the baggage, light-armed troops,
and the flanks of the square in such order as was most practicable.
The wings and three special companies of the rear division of the
Square, maneuvering in the same way as those of the front, would pass
through last, the three companies forming a rear guard against attacks
by the pursuing enemy.
