96,6. τὰ μέν: sc. πάθη, cognate accusative, he received some inju-
ries; τέλος δέ correlates with it. — ὧν καί: omit καί in translation.

ο6, 8. πολλοῖς μακαριστόν : cp. τοῖς οἴκοι ζηλωτόν, 84, 10.

Vocab. 

ἐπίστενον: as the keynote of the passage, this verb occurs

αἱ πόλεις:

96, 17. μηδέν: would be οὐδέν in direct discourse, and is therefore

96, 22. ἔλεγεν: we might have had λόγῳ corresponding to ἔργῳ. —

προοῖτο : formed as if from a verb in -έω or -όω.2 There was a tendency
for verbs in -μι to take on forms of the -ω conjugation. Compare the
tendency in English whereby many irregular verbs have become regular,
as ‘clomb,’ an old past form of ‘climb,’ has given way, except in poetry,
to ‘climbed.’ The potential optative in indirect discourse changes from
the form of direct discourse only in person.

ἐπεὶ... ἐγένετο: an aorist
indicative in a subordinate clause does not become optative in indirect
discourse.4

96, 23. εἰ... πράξειαν: less vivid future conditions, quoted without
