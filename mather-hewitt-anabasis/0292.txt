#280 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS __ 2,7

83, 23. ἀνθρώπων: genitive with a verb of want.1 Observe that ἄνδρες
is used of the Greeks, and note the difference in the significance of the
two words. — ἀπορῶν, νομίζων: causal.

83, 24. κρείττους: stronger.

83, 25. διὰ τοῦτο: sums up νομίζων. .. εἶναι.

84, 1. ὅπως. .. ἔσεσθε: the future indicative with ὅπως in an urgent
command,2 de sure, therefore, to be men, etc. Although this construction
probably arose from the use of ὅπως depending on a verb of striving or
caring for (see on ἔσται, 52, 2), it is unlikely that in Xenophon’s time
any ellipsis was felt. — 

ἐλευθερίας: see on πολλοῦ, 66, 16. 

ἧς: attracted
from the accusative,3 in which it would naturally stand as object of
κέκτησθε.

84, 2. ἧς: genitive of cause. According to the Persian notion, Cyrus
himself was the slave of the king (100, 1), who alone, of all the Persians,
was free. — τήν: with an abstract noun; cp. 77, 20.

84, 3. ἀντὶ ὧν, εἰς. : 2.6. ἀντὶ πάντων ἃ ἔχω; the antecedent is taken
into the relative clause and attracts the relative to its own case.5— 

καὶ ἄλλων, etc.: with ἀντί.

84, 4. ὅπως. .. εἰδῆτε: a purpose clause, depending on διδάξω.

84, 5. εἰδώς: cp. 83, 7.— γάρ: omit, or render namely (see Vocab.).
— πολύ: predicate after ἐστί understood.

84, 6. εἰδώς: with future force ; the change to plural with a collective
noun is natural in English too. — 

ἄν: at the beginning of a clause always = ἐάν, for ἄν with the optative never stands first (see 1. 3 for instance).

84, 7. τὰ ἄλλα: as for the rest, accusative of specification. — 

καί: as
in 83, 1.— 

αἰσχύνεσθαί μοι δοκῶ: I feel ashamed (to think).— ol

οἵους . ..
ἀνθρώπους: predicate of ὄντας, a participle in indirect discourse after
γνώσεσθε, what sorry folk, upon my word, you will discover those in our
country to be.—

ἣμῖν: ethical dative or dative of feeling, a weakened
dative of interest, giving a colloquial touch to the language, like upon
my word, bless us, dear me, don’t you know.6

84, 8. ὑμῶν... ὄντων : implies condition, as does the following εὖ τῶν
ἐμῶν (5.5. πραγμάτων) γενομένων, if my undertaking turns out weld.
