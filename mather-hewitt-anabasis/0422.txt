᾿Αμαζών, -όνος, ἡ, Amazon, one of a
mythical race of women warriors,
whose home, at first of indefinite
location in the far north or east,
was commonly placed in classical
times about the Thermodon River
on the south shore of the Black
Sea (see map, frontispiece). Their
exploits, including their assistance
to King Priam under their queen
Penthesiléa (Virgil, Aeneid 1. 491)
in the Trojan War, and their battles
with Bellerophon, Hercules, and
Theseus, were the subjects of many
legends. As types of female strength
and beauty they were often repre-
sented in painting and sculpture,
sometimes with a crescent-shaped
shield, helmet, quiver, bow and ar-
rows, and spear or double-edged
battle-ax (σάγαρις). The Amazon
River in South America received its
name from the report of the Span-
ish discoverers that they found a
race of warlike women living there.
