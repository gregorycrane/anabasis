2, 1]: NOTES 307

Atyurrov: Cambyses, son of Cyrus the Great, invaded and overcame
Egypt (525 B.c.), but the country had been a continual trouble to the
succeeding rulers of Persia, and at this time was independent, with
kings of its own. The Greeks hint that with their aid the Egyptians
may be brought again under Persian dominion.

108, 14. ovyxatacrpépawr av: better adapted in sense to orparevey
than to the more general dAXo te. . . xpnoOat, although the latter very
likely refers to assistance that they might render the king in subduing
other refractory peoples, such as the Pisidians or the Lycaonians; see
on daprdcat, 61, 13.

108,17. &AAos: in partitive apposition with otro; cp. ra pév... Ta
d€, 93, I.

108, 19. olpat: see on 98, 21; translate and, / think, all the others
have too.

108, 20. pets: sc. “EAAnvés eopev. — rorobro: . . . Seous: the fact is
emphasized that all present, without exception, were Greeks — there
was no one to report his words to the king.

108, 21. oupPovdrevdpe84 oor: Clearchus unexpectedly puts the meet-
ing in anew light. Behold Phalinus transformed from drillmaster and
messenger of Artaxerxes to one of the advisory committee of the Greek
army!

108, 27. dvdyKn: SC. éori.

108, 29. Kal... mperPebovra: even the very man who was acting as
ambassador, etc.

109, 3. troorpépas: the plan of Clearchus was well laid, but Greek
has met Greek. Observe the idea of craft suggested by tzo- in ta7yero,
108, 29, and here.

109, 4. tév: article with a round number, as in 58, 16. — pla nts (sc.
€Azris) : a single one, more indefinite than pu.—éom: in this simple
condition, and in its corresponding negative supposition in l. 6 f.,
Phalinus gives no hint as to whether he believes there is or is not a
hope for the Greeks, so that Clearchus is not a whit farther ahead than
before.

109, 5. cwbfjvar: = owrypias, 1. 6. It depends on é€Amis, to be sup-
plied from éAzidwy, 1. 4; for the infinitive with a substantive, see on
xabevoewv, 66, 10. — rodepotvras : agrees with iyas implied as the subject
of cwhjvat; see on AaBovra, 55, 4.

109, 7. G&kovtos: Cp. 67, 26, and see note. — tptv: with cvpPovdAciw.
