#264 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,4

by a credible person who went up to the king [at Susa] that he passed
through a large tract of excellent land, extending for nearly a day’s
journey, which the people of the country called the queen’s girdle, and
another, which they called her veil” (Jowett’s translation).

72,14. Συρίας: see on αὐτῶν, 53, 5. — ἄρξαντος: observe the tense,
the former ruler. Belésys had evidently fled, so that Cyrus considered
him no longer the ruler.

72,16. πάντα ὅσα: emphasizes the idea of quantity.

72,17. ὧραι: the article is often omitted in common designations
of time. — 

αὐτόν: the park.

72, 22. σταδίων: it is now only about 400 feet. Perhaps σταδίων is
a copyist's error for πλέθρων. 

φκεῖτο: see on οἰκουμένην, 69, 7.

72,25. ἔσοιτο: he said ἔσται, i.e. from now on, intimating what was
of course untrue, that his resolve to attack the king had only just then
been taken; cp. ἁλώσοιντο, 71, 3, and see note. Cyrus had enticed the
Greeks to a point whence they could not retreat without his aid and he
was now ready to throw off the mask. Undoubtedly their indignation
would have been far greater had they not before this more than sus-
pected that they were bound for Babylon (68, 21). They had perhaps
already made up their minds to follow Cyrus against the king if they
should succeed in securing a largess, and their anger may have been
more or less feigned to induce their generals to aid them in this. See
Introd. § 11. 

73, 4. τοῖς στρατηγοῖς: indirect object. See Introd. § 68.

73. 5. πάλαι... κρύπτειν: had (have in direct discourse) long been
concealing it.1

εἰδότας: concessive. This charge was true only of
Clearchus.

73,6. διδῷ: retains the mood of direct discourse. — 

τὶς : refers to Cyrus,
whose name is purposely not mentioned; cp. ὃ ἀνήρ, 66, 16. --- 

ὥσπερ:
here just as; contrast 67, 18.— 


τοῖς προτέροις... ἀναβᾶσι: = τοῖς
πρότερον... ἀναβᾶσι; for the event, see 51, 9 f., and cp. 68, 4 ff.

73, 8. καὶ ταῦτα... ἰόντων: with the participle sc. ἐκείνων ; ταῦτα
has no grammatical construction,2 and that too although they were going.
The participle might be in the dative, agreeing with τοῖς προτέροις. —
καλοῦντος: causal; the present participle represents the imperfect; see
On ἀκούοντες, 71, 18.
