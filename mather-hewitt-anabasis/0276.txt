264 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,4

by a credible person who went up to the king [at Susa] that he passed
through a large tract of excellent land, extending for nearly a day’s
journey, which the people of the country called the queen’s girdle, and
another, which they called her veil” (Jowett’s translation).

72,14. Zvplas: see on avrwy, 53, 5. — &pfavros: observe the tense,
the former ruler. Belésys had evidently fled, so that Cyrus considered
him no longer the ruler.

72,16. wavra Soa: emphasizes the idea of quantity.

72,17. @pat: the article is often omitted in common designations
of time. — airév: the park.

72, 22. σταδίων: it is now only about 4oo feet. Perhaps σταδίων 15
a copyist's error for 7A€Opwv. — @xetro: see on olxovperny, 69, 7.

72,25. toro: he said écraz, z.¢. from now on, intimating what was
of course untrue, that his resolve to attack the king had only just then
been taken; cp. dAwcowro, 71, 3, and see note. Cyrus had enticed the
Greeks to a point whence they could not retreat without his aid and he
was now ready to throw off the mask. Undoubtedly their indignation
would have been far greater had they not before this more than sus-
pected that they were bound for Babylon (68, 21). They had perhaps
already made up their minds to follow Cyrus against the king if they
should succeed in securing a largess, and their anger may have been
more or less feigned to induce their generals to aid them in this. See
Introd. § 11. .

73, 4. tots orparnyois: indirect object. See Introd. § 68.

73. 5. πάλαι... κρύπτειν: ad (have in direct discourse) long been
concealing it.1—et8éras: concessive. This charge was true only of
Clearchus.

73,6. 88: retains the mood of direct discourse. — ts : refers to Cyrus,
whose name is purposely not mentioned; cp. ὃ ἀνήρ, 66, 16. --- ὥσπερ:
here just as; contrast 67, 18.— Tots mporépos . . . dvaBaow: = Tois
πρότερον... ἀναβᾶσι; for the event, see 51, 9 f., and cp. 68, 4 ff.

73, 8. wal raira ... iédvrwv: with the participle sc. éxe(vwv; ταῦτα
has no grammatical construction,? and that too although they were going.
The participle might be in the dative, agreeing with rots mporépots. —
Kadotvros: causal; the present participle represents the imperfect; see
On aKovovTes, 71, 18.
