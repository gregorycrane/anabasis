PREFACE ne

Tuts volume contains the text, with notes and vocabulary, of

the first four books of the Anaéasts, together with an introduc-
tion on the expedition of the Ten Thousand Greeks, Xenophon’s
life. and the army of Cyrus. In the division of the work
Mr. Hewitt has written the notes on Books I and II, Mr. Mather
those on Books III and IV. The writing of the Introduction
and the selection of the illustrations rested chiefly with Mr.
Mather, while for the preparation of the text and of the Vocabu-
lary the editors were equally responsible.

It is the aim in the Introduction to give briefly the story of
the expedition, its causes and results, to sketch with considerable
fullness Xenophon’s career both as a man of action and as a
writer, and to describe the military antiquities connected with
the expedition sufficiently to make all references to them in the
first four books of the Anaédasis intelligible to the pupil. The
short list of books at the end of the Introduction will provide
interesting collateral reading for those pupils and teachers who
wish to make a more thorough study of the expedition, of Persia,
and of Xenophon.

The text is based on a comparison of Marchant’s edition
(Oxford, 1904) with Gemoll’s editio maior (Leipzig, 1899). In
some details, however, neither of these authorities has been
followed. For instance, the genitive plural of neuters in -os,
like dpos, is spelled regularly with contraction, as ὀρῶν 62, 14.
Again, in order to avoid variations in spelling, like ἀεί αἰεί, εἰς
és, ow vv, — occurring in the Mss. and properly adopted in
text editions, but which in a book of this sort merely add to the
difficulties of the young pupil,—only the commoner form has
been admitted. In 162, 24 Cobet’s conjecture rovrois has been
