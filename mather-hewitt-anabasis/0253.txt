56, 23. Κελαινῶν: a poetical use, in which the genitive takes the
place of a noun in apposition; so regularly in English, as ‘city of Lon-
don,’ ‘state of Maine.’—éere: observe the accent.1— peydrov βασι-
λέως : the adjective is usually omitted, as with βασιλέα, 1. 3.

from the base of a rocky cliff. The cave from which it once flowed has
now fallen in. — καὶ οὗτος: this too, as well as the Meander (56, 22 f.).

57,4. λέγεται ᾿Απόλλων: the personal construction (Apollo is said)
with the passive of verbs which take an infinitive of indirect discourse,
and with some other expressions, is more frequent than the impersonal

Athena, after inventing the flute, threw it away in disgust because she
found that the act of blowing it distorted her comely features. If was
discovered by Marsyas, the god of the river which rises at Celaenae.
He was so delighted with his discovery and his musical ability that he
had the presumption to challenge Apollo, the leader of the Muses and
patron of the fine arts, who was proficient with the far more melodious
lyre. The challenger, defeated, was punished for his arrogance in the
manner mentioned by Xenophon. The story is given by Ovid, Meta-
morphoses 6. 382 ff., Hastd 6. 697 ff. — νικήσας: expresses simple occur-

denotes time when, like the Latin ablative.
