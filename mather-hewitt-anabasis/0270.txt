#258 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,3

68, 9. ἀφιέναι: distinguish from amévar; sc. ἡμᾶς as object. --- ἑπό-
μένοι, ἀπιόντες : serve as protases to the following optatives, hence are
equivalent to εἰ and the optative in less vivid future conditions.

68, 10. φίλοι: agreeing as predicate adjective with the. subject of
ἑποίμεθα.

68, 11. ἀπαγγεῖλαι δεῦρο: that they report here; the subject is still
ἄνδρας, l. 2.

68, 13. ἔδοξε ταῦτα: this was resolved upon; cp. τὰ δόξαντα, l. 14,
the questions resolved upon.

68, 14. στρατιᾷ: see on αὐτῷ, 54, 19, but to be rendered by the army.

68, 15. dἀκούει : Cyrus said ἀκούω, using present for perfect, as in Eng-
lish ‘I hear you have been away’ for ‘I have heard,’ etc. — ἐχθρόν: here
an adjective (cp. 66,17). An attack on Abrocdmas as a personal en-
emy would not be equivalent to a declaration of war against Artaxerxes.
For the royal policy in such matters, see on αὐτῶν πολεμούντων, 53, 8.

68, 16. εἶναι : for a different construction with dxovw, see ἔχοντα,
62, 15.— ἀπέχοντα: refers to Abrocomas. On this plea Cyrus suc-
ceeded in luring the Greeks nineteen stages farther before he declared
his real intention.

68,17. κἄν: crasis for καὶ ἐάν.1

68, 18. τὴν δίκην: δίκη regularly appears in this phrase without the
article, as in 66, 9; here the proper punishment, the punishment he
deserved.

68, 19. φύγῃ : equivalent to the Latin future perfect, Aas (shall have)
fied; see on πρὶν ἂν... συμβουλεύσηται, 54, 7. --- ἡμεῖς, etc.. : as is
intimated in l. 21, the answer was not fully satisfactory, but the sol-
diers decided that the difficulties of advance were less than those of
retreat.

68, 20. αἱρετοί: the ἄνδρας of 1. 2.

68, 21. τοῖς δέ: dative of possessor; see on ὁ δέ, 51, 14.

ὅτι ἄγει: indirect discourse, the verb keeping the form which it had in the direct
discourse (He is leading); English requires a past tense (he was lead-
ing) when the main verb is past.

68, 22. προσαιτοῦσι: in translation, combine the force of προσ- with
the noun rather than with the verb, asked for more pay.

68, 23. πᾶσι: we might expect ἑκάστῳ. --- δώσειν: the usual tense
after a verb of promising, as in Latin. 

οὗ: as object of ἔφερον the
