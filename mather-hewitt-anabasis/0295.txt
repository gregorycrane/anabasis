#283

for the battle (see 1. 5), only 900,000 of the king’s forces can have
taken part in the fighting. Even this number is probably an exagger-
ation. Ctesias, a Greek physician in the king’s suite, is said by Plu-
tarch (Life of Artaxerxes, 13) to have given the number as 400,000.
See Introd. § 13.

86,3. τῇ μάχῃ: the battle of Cunaxa, which soon followed.

86, ς. ὑστέρησε τῆς μάχης: was too late for (lit., later than1) the
battle. This is in harmony with his previous conduct (see on 70, 2, 74,
21). He had the start of Cyrus and should have arrived before him.
If Cyrus had been successful, Abrocomas would scarcely have failed to
claim credit for keeping his contingent out of the battle. — ἡμέραις:
dative of degree of difference; cp. 63, 7.

86, 8. οἵ: those who; it is limited by the partitive, τῶν πολεμίων.

86, 9. ταὐτά: contrast with ταῦτα, l. 6, and cp. τὰ αὐτά, 52, 23.

86, 11. συντεταγμένῳ τῷ στρατεύματι: dative of military accompani-
ment,2 wth his army drawn up in battle array.

86, 13. βασιλέα: subject of the infinitive.— 

κατά: along about; cp. 78, 11. 

μέσον: see on 56, 21.

86, 15. ὀργναί: in apposition with τάφρος, instead of the usual geni-
tive of measure (see l. 19) ; εὖρος and βάθος are accusatives of specifica-
tion.

86,17. Μηδίας τείχους: see Vocab. Evidently the wall was here in
ruins, or the ditch would have been unnecessary.

86, 18. ὡς: with εἴκοσι. Why the passage was left is not clear.

Probably the king had been prevented from completing the trench by
the approach of Cyrus.
86, 22. παρῆλθε καὶ ἐγένοντο: the author’s thought suddenly changes.
With the singular verb, Cyrus and the army are conceived of as a unit ;
with the plural, they are taken separately and the soldiers making up
the army are in mind.

86, 24. ἦσαν: note the number, and see on ἦσαν, etc., 69, 25.

87, I. δαρεικοὺς τρισχιλίους: about $16,200, but with a purchasing
power several times greater. 

87, 2. ἀπ᾽ ἐκείνης : before that. — 

θυόμενος: for the distinction between
the active and middle, see Vocab.

87, 3. ἡμερῶν : time within which.
