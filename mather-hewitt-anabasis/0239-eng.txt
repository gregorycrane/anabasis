NOTES

TITLE. "AvéBacrg: this title applies strictly only to the first book of
the narrative. The word means ‘a going up.’ The Greeks considered
any progress away from the coast, whether out to sea (dvazAeciv) or
inland, as here (avaBaiveyv), to be ‘a going yp.’ Conversely, to return
from the interior to the coast was to ‘go down’ (xaraPaivety), just as
to put in to shore from the high sea was to ‘sail down’ (xaramdX¢iv).
The march of the Ten Thousand became therefore a Catabasis (xara-
Baots) as soon as they turned their steps coastward, which they did
shortly after the battle at Cunaxa.

BOOK I

Page 51,1.* CHAPTERI. Aapelov, etc. : genitive of source.1— ylyvov-
rat: historical present,? here better called the annalistic or notebook
present, which is used as in diaries or notebooks to record incidents,
especially births, deaths, and accessions. — wat&es 5vo: a plural noun is
often used with dvo. Darius and Parysatis had in all thirteen children,
nine of whom died young. Of the surviving four, these two only are
of importance for the narrative. See Introd. § 1.

51, 2. pev.. . &€: here, as often, these particles are to be trans-
lated only by stress of voice on the words which they follow. — Kipos:
not to be confused with his more famous ancestor, Cyrus the Great.
The following amusing lines are quoted by Robert Browning (Works,
Riverside edition, IV, p. xi) as the beginning of a young friend’s
poetical translation of the Anadbasis:

Cyrus the Great and Artaxerxes

(Whose temper bloodier than a Turk’s is)
Were children both of the mild, pious,
And happy monarch King Darius.
