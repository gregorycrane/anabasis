dative of interest, denoting the one upon whom rests the necessity of
doing the act.

67, 14. wowntéov: sc. ori and see on oxerréov, 66, 12; it is impossi-
ble to determine whether we have here the personal or the impersonal

Gv5pl.. . weloopar: the dative is used of the one for whom a person
persuades himself, z.e. the one whom he obeys?; cp. értorevov yap

padtora: sc. éoriv, fo the best of my ability.

67, 15. &pxerOar: passive.

67,16. &s rs, etc.: as well as anybody else in the world; padsora

superfluous after ws tts Kal dAAos, yet it adds emphasis. dvOpwzrwyv is
partitive with the superlative. «ac is not translatable.

but the construction changes at once to direct discourse.

ing on airety, see ]. 5.—w: dative of interest implying disadvantage ;
cp. ovdevt, 63, 18, and see note. —el .. . morevoopev: not expressing
a future condition, but a present intention‘ of doing something in the
future; 2f we are thinking of trusting, if we are going to trust.

ironical, amounting to ‘If we make such senseless and unreasonable
