1,.7] NOTES 283

for the battle (see 1. 5), only go0,000 of the king’s forces can have
taken part in the fighting. Even this number is probably an exagger-
ation. Ctesias, a Greek physician in the king’s suite, is said by Plu-
tarch (Life of Artaxerxes, 13) to have given the number as 400,000.
See Introd. § 13.

tion.

86,17. Mndlas trelxovs: see Vocab. Evidently the wall was here in
ruins, or the ditch would have been unnecessary.

86, 18. os: with exoot. Why the passage was left is not clear.

Probably the king had been prevented from completing the trench by
the approach of Cyrus.
- 86, 22. wapfA0e kal éyévovro: the author’s thought suddenly changes.
