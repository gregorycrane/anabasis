#248 XENOPHON'’S ANABASIS [1, 2

63, 5. Σόλοις: originally a Greek colony, and hence it had nothing to
fear. —Ἰσσοῖς: near the scene of Alexander’s great battle with the Per-
sians in 333 B.c. The inhabitants of these two towns remained to trade
with the fleet and army. Such plurals as these and Ταρσούς (62, 25)
are thought to be the name of the inhabitants applied to the city.

63, 6. προτέρα: adjective equivalent to an English adverb; see on
ἑκοῦσαι, 53, 26.— Κύρον: genitive of comparison with προτέρα.1

63, 7. ἡμέραις: dative of degree of difference.2

63, 8. λόχοι: the Adyxos consisted normally of one hundred men (In-
trod. § 56), but it seems here that the two missing λόχοι together con-
tained only that number (see l. 12). Perhaps the λόχοι were not full,
or possibly ἕκαστος should be read before ἑκατόν, one hundred each.

63,9. οἱ μὲν... οἱ δέ: see on 52, 24. ἁρπάζοντάς τι: circumstan-
tial participle of time and cognate accusative, while engaged in some act
of depredation. — κατακοπῆναι: cp. the construction after φημί3 with
that after λέγω, 62, 12.

63, 10. Κιλίκων: see on ὑπὸ. .. ἀντιστασιωτῶν, 54, 2.

63,11. τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα: the rest of the army, of Menon’s command.

63,12. foav: amounted to. —8 ovv: see on 59, 9. .

63, 13. οἱ δ᾽ ἄλλοι: -- τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα, 1. 11.— τε: correlative
with καί, l. 1.

63, 14. διήρπασαν: an act not authorized by Cyrus and probably dis-
continued on his arrival.

63, 16. μετεπέμπετο : the tense denotes repetition.

63,17. πρὸς ἑαυτόν: 20 his presence. — οὔτε... ἔφη: the οὐ of οὔτε,
though grammatically belonging with ἔφη, goes in sense with the infini-
tive, said that he had not before up to this time come, etc.; cp. the use
of Lat. nego, as negat sé... posse, he says that he cannot, Caesar, Gal-
lic War 1.8. Translate οὔτε... , etc., he said that he had not...
and he did not wish either. ἤθελε is in the same construction as ἔφη.

63, 18. πρότερον: superfluous with πω. — οὐδενί: being a compound
negative, it does not make an affirmative with οὔτε, but strengthens the
negation.4 Translate the dative 5 as a possessive genitive, of anybody,
with εἰς χεῖρας. — ἑαυτοῦ: see on Κύρου, l. 6.
