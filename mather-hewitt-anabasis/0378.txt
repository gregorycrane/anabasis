306 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [3, 4

171, 3. ἄκρον: of the first hill, which the enemy had occupied after
the Greeks had begun to descend.

171, 6. dmloev: the optative (see on 56, 20) shows that they adv anced
against the enemy more than once, being assailed with a volley of
missiles each time they went back to their main army.

171, 13. ἀνήγαγον: 566 Οἢ ἔπεισε, 63, 21.

171, 14. ὄρος : 566 170,4. This mountain was evidently parallel with
the road and on the right of it.

171, 19. woddwior: it is rather careless writing to use the same word
within two lines to reter first to the Persians and then to the Greeks,
but the context makes it clear. By going back along the mountain-
side the peltasts could easily come down on the road in the rear of the
Persians.

171, 20. οἱ μὲν. .. οἱ δέ: one arty (the mainarmy) .. . ¢theother
(the peltasts) ; cp. 167, 23. Tq ὁδῷ: dative of means, by the road ower
the hills.

on beside them, but at some distance above the road.

171) 22. xatéorncav: appointed, from the common soldiers. Medical
practice at this time was largely quackery. Surgical operations were
limited to cutting and burning. Xenophon says (Anabasts 5. 8. 18),
oi larpot Kaiovot Kal Téuvovow éx adyabe, surgeons burn and cut for
the patient’s good. — woddXol, etc.: the article distinguishes the subject
from the predicate; see on 7AnOos, etc., 148, 17.

1719), 25. καὶ. .. εἶχον: an independent construction, similar to the
usage in compound relative sentences; see on éoTparevoaper, 144, 3-
Translate as if kat dua ore (because) were written.

171, 26. Yarmos: dative of interest implying advantage. — mwodAds: 71
great guantities,somewhat emphasized by being separated from its noun.

171, 27. watpamevovtt: participle, acting governor, dative of agent
with pluperfect passive, showing well the original force of the construc-
tion as dative of interest.! — xépas: for case, see ἡμῶν, 156, 2

172, I. a&vdyxyn: necessity was the mother of invention.

172, 3. Terpwpévor, etc.: note the tenses of these participles, the per-
fect expressing completion (Aad been wounded), the present continu-
ance (were carrying), and the aorist simple occurrence (¢o0#), at the
time of ἦσαν.
