2, 1]: NOTES 307

Atyurrov: Cambyses, son of Cyrus the Great, invaded and overcame
Egypt (525 B.c.), but the country had been a continual trouble to the
succeeding rulers of Persia, and at this time was independent, with
kings of its own. The Greeks hint that with their aid the Egyptians
may be brought again under Persian dominion.

108, 14. συγκαταστρέψαιντ᾽ av: better adapted in sense ἴο στρατεύειν
than to the more general dAXo τι. . . xpnoOat, although the latter very
likely refers to assistance that they might render the king in subduing
other refractory peoples, such as the Pisidians or the Lycaonians; see
Οἱ διαρπάσαι, 61, 13.

108,17. &AAos: in partitive apposition with otro; cp. τὰ μὲν... τὰ
d€, 93, I.

108, 19. οἶμαι: see on 98, 21; translate and, / think, all the others
have too.

108, 20. ἡμεῖς : 80. Ἕλληνές ἐσμεν. --- rorobro: . . . Seous: the fact is
emphasized that all present, without exception, were Greeks — there
was no one to report his words to the king.

108, 21. συμβουλενόμεθά oor: Clearchus unexpectedly puts the meet-
ing in anew light. Behold Phalinus transformed from drillmaster and
messenger of Artaxerxes to one of the advisory committee of the Greek
army!

108, 24. Aeyspevov: when reported as follows, limiting 6.

1ο8, 27. ἀνάγκη: 5ς. ἐστί.

108, 29. καὶ... πρεσβεύοντα : even the very man who was acting as
ambassador, etc.

109, 3. troorpépas: the plan of Clearchus was well laid, but Greek
has met Greek. Observe the idea of craft suggested by ὕπο- ἴῃ ὑπήγετο,
108, 29, and here.

109, 4. τῶν: article with a round number, as in 58, 16. — pla nts (sc.
€Azris) : a single one, more indefinite than pu.—éom: in this simple
condition, and in its corresponding negative supposition in l. 6 f.,
Phalinus gives no hint as to whether he believes there is or is not a
hope for the Greeks, so that Clearchus is not a whit farther ahead than
before.

109, 5. cwbfjvar: = owrypias, 1. 6. It depends on ἐλπίς, to be sup-
plied from éAzidwy, 1. 4; for the infinitive with a substantive, see on
καθεύδειν, 66, το. ---- πολεμοῦντας : Ἄρτα 65 ΜΙ ὑμᾶς implied as the subject
οὗ σωθῆναι: 566 οὔ λαβόντα, 55. 4.

109, 7. ἄκοντος : ΟΡ. 67, 26, ἀη4 566 ποία. --- ὑμῖν : ψΊ συμβουλεύω.
