3, 1] NOTES 341

145, 10. Kayo 8: see on Kat, 51, 6.

145, II. iyeto@ar: as the context shows, used here merely of taking
the lead in rousing their comrades to action, not of military leadership.

145, 12. od$v: adverbial accusative ; see 53, 8. — fAuclav: as in 143,
14, Xenophon’s reference to his age shows that he was still a young
man, and helps to determine approximately the date of his birth. See
Introd. § 28.

145, 13. époxew: depends on dxpalev. — xaxd: dangers, arising not
only from the jealousy of some of his comrades but also from the plots
of Persian sympathizers among the Greeks.

145, 14. Aekev, éxérevov: the aorist of a simple statement of past fact,
the imperfect of repetition (one after another urging him).

145, 15. wdvreg: the emphasis should be retained in translation, they
bade him take the lead, all of them except that there was a fellow, etc.

145, 16. gewvq: dative of respect. — prvapolyn, Adyer: an illustration
of the principle that the indicative may, or may not, be changed to the
optative in indirect discourse depending on a past tense.!

145,17. gwwrnplas: partitive genitive with a verb of attaining.?

145, 20. GvOpwre: fellow, with contempt; cp. Lat. omd.—ot8&...
ot8: distinguish from otvre...ovre. Translate the participles by rela-
tive clauses, what you see, etc. The idea expressed here was prover-
bial. It occurs several times in the Old and New Testaments; cp.
“ Seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they under-
stand,” Matthew 13. 13.

145, 21. év rair@ . . . robros: with these gentlemen (lit., in the
same place with them*®; cp. 91, 16).

145, 22. dméBave: = passive of dmoxreivw; translate as pluperfect
(see on 140, 1). —péya: cognate accusative, equivalent to an adverb.

145, 23. &x&Meve: the tense represents the continuance of the de-
mand during the parley of the Greeks with Phalinus; see 106, 23 ff.

145, 25. érolynce: note the aorist, simply stating the fact, where we
might have had the imperfect to express the continued action which
the context clearly indicates.

146, 2. atrots: cp. col, 126, 16.

146, 3. od: interrogative, expecting the answer yes,‘ like Latin ndnme.
