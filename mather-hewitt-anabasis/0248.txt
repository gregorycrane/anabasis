236 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,1

54, 3. αὐτόν, μισθόν : double accusative with a verb of asking!; both
are direct objects; cp. carpdayy, 51, 6.— εἰς. .. ξένους: since Cyrus
would hardly have been willing to send to such a distance as Thessaly
troops which he had at hand, already assembled in Asia, it seems best to
take closely with μισθὸν not only τριῶν μηνῶν but also εἰς . . . ξένους,
pay for 2000 mercenaries (and) for three months (cp. εἰς, 53, 24) ; that
is, Aristippus was to raise the forces himself with money furnished by
Cyrus. Later he sent 1500 men under Menon to take part in the
expedition of Cyrus; see 56, 13.

54, 4. μηνῶν: genitive of measure.2 — ὡς... περιγενόμενος ἄν : Decause
(expressed by the circumstantial participle of cause), as he said, he would
thus, etc. For as, see on ws ἀποκτενῶν, 51, 15. The participle with
ἄν 3 is equivalent to the potential optative,4 representing the apodosis
of a less vivid future condition, of which the protasis (‘if he should give
them to him’) is implied in οὕτως.

54,5. ἀντιστασιωτῶν : genitive of comparison.5— Swe: Cyrus may
have been the more willing to grant this request because Aristippus
belonged to the noble family of the Aleuadae, who had been the first
of the Greeks to submit to Xerxes when he invaded Greece in 480 B.c.

54,6. αὐτοῦ: the genitive serves as one object of οὗ δεῖται, μὴ...
καταλῦσαι Being another object; cp. “let him ask of God,” James
I. 5.

54,7. μή: the regular negative with the infinitive when it is not in
indirect discourse.’ — πρόσθεν: anticipates the following πρίν and is not
to be translated. καταλῦσαι: weds: fo come to terms with. πρὶν ἂν
. .. συμβουλεύσηται: πρίν takes the finite moods chiefly after nega-
tives. The subjunctive® refers vividly to the future (cp. more vivid
future conditions) and expresses the thought as it existed in the mind of
Cyrus when he made the request (implied indirect discourse 10) ; the
aorist subjunctive expresses simple occurrence in the future, and so may
