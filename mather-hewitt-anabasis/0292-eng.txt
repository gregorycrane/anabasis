280 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS __ 2,7

83, 23. dvOpérev: genitive with a verb of want.! Observe that dvdpes

two words. — dwopév, vopl{ev: causal.

83, 24. xpélrrovs: stronger.

83, 25. Sa robro: sums up vouilwv ... elvat.

84, 1. bres... iveorGe: the future indicative with ows in an urgent
command,? de sure, therefore, to be men, etc. Although this construction
probably arose from the use of 6zws depending on a verb of striving or
caring for (see on €orat, 52, 2), it is unlikely that in Xenophon’s time
any ellipsis was felt. — &evOeplas: see on zroAAov, 66, 16. — ys : attracted
from the accusative,? in which it would naturally stand as object of
Kextno Oe. |

84, 2. ys: genitive of cause. According to the Persian notion, Cyrus
himself was the slave of the king (100, 1), who alone, of all the Persians,
was free. — rv: with an abstract noun; cp. 77, 20.

84, 6, émlacw: with future force ; the change to plural with a collective
noun is natural in English too. — 4v: at the beginning of a clause always

= éav, for dv with the optative never stands first (see 1. 3 for instance).

84, 7. Ta GAAa: as for the rest, accusative of specification. — «al: as
in 83, 1.— aloxbver Gal por 80nd: / feel ashamed (to think).— olovs ...
