1, 1] NOTES 235

535 17. δίδωσιν: 566 on ἀνέβη, 51, 10.—μυρίους δαρεικούς: nearly
$55,000, but it should be kept in mind that the purchasing power of
money was much greater then than now.

53, 19. ἀπὸ. .. χρημάτων: viewed as the source whence sprang his
ability to collect an army; the dative of means might have been used.

53, 21. ὁρμώμενος: Clearchus used this country as a base.

53, 22. Θρᾳξί: for the case, see on Τισσαφέρνει, 1. 7. --- τοῖς ὑπὲρ
“Ἑλλήσποντον οἰκοῦσι: for the position of this attributive phrase, cp.
τῇ . . Ἀβύδου, 1. 13.

53, 24. Ἕλληνας: they were Greek colonists of the Chersonese and
the Thracian shore of the Propontis, who, being regarded by the natives
as intruders, had to wage a continual struggle to maintain their posi-
tion. — καί: even, i.e. money as well as supplies and other assistance.
Great care should be exercised in the translation of καί. It is often not
connective, but intensive, i.e. not a conjunction, but an adverb. —
συνεβάλλοντο: for the mood, see on ὥστε . ... εἶναι, 52,7. The tense
shows that they gave not only once but repeatedly. The aorist would
indicate that they gave a single lump sum. —αὐτῷ: not dependent on
the preposition of the compound verb (contributed with him, cp. αὐτῷ,
1. 5), but a dative of interest implying advantage, gave him their con-
tributions. — εἰς: of purpose, for, towards.

53, 25. τῶν στρατιωτῶν: objective genitive; cp. αὐτῶν, 51, Io.

53, 26. ἑκοῦσαι: usually best translated as an adverb; here it might
be rendered and were glad to do it. — τοῦτο... τὸ στράτευμα: observe
how, in a highly inflected language like Greek or Latin, words widely
separated (for emphasis or other considerations of style) are shown to
belong together by agreement in gender, number, and case. In Eng-
lish, where inflection gives little help in determining the agreement, the
order of words is more restricted. — οὕτω: note how this differs from
ὧδε, 52, 13. --- τρεφόμενον ἐλάνθανεν: was secretly supported ; for gram-
mar reference, see on παρών, 51, 5, and observe the different way of
translating the participle. — αὐτῷ: for him, i.e. Cyrus ; see on αὐτῷ, l. 12.

54, 1. ξένος: predicate nominative.

54, 2. ὑπὸ... ἀντιστασιωτῶν: the regular construction of the agent;
cp. ἐκ βασιλέως, 52, 19, and see note. —οἴκοι: in attributive position.1
Note the quantity of the final syllable.2
