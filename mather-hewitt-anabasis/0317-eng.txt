106, 15. noav éperGar (middie): were (there for them) to carry off.
The infinitive depends on joav and denotes that for which the sub-
ject serves. Cp. éxel oxia T éori kai oa xabilecOau, there is shade and
grass to sit down on, Plato, Phaedrus 229 B. The infinitive is origi-
nally a dative, and this usage with eiui, which was commoner in poetry
than in prose, may be compared with the Latin dative in such phrases
as Clirae esse, auxtlid esse, etc. — épynpor: predicate, having been aban-
