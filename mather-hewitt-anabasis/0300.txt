θορύβον. ..
ἰόντος: partitive genitive of the sound heard2; the person heard is
the source, as Κύρου, 1. 8. The participle is circumstantial, not supple-
mentary in indirect discourse; see on διελαύνοντα, 79, 10.

σύνθημα: see Introd. § 66.

92, 1. δεύτερον: fur the second time, 2.6. it was repeated back from
the last man to the first in order to avoid mistakes, just as a telegraphic
message is ‘repeated.’ —

he. 

ἐθαύμασε: the watchword would naturally have been given out by
him, the commander in chief. 

παραγγέλλει, εἴη : ΟΡ. μέλει, ἔχοι, 91, 14.

92, 8. ἤρχοντο: from ἄρχω.—

verb; see on ἑκοῦσαι, 53, 26. For the case, see on τίμιος, 65, 10. —
πολεμίοις : dative with an adjective.4

ὡς: temporal conjunction with
ἐξεκύμαινε. ---- 

πορευομένων : σψ. αὐτῶν, genitive absolute of time.

the tense, was being left behind.

92, 10. οἷον: adverb (originally cognate accusative with ἐλελίζουσι,
the sort of battle cry they raise).

92, If. ἐλελίζουσι: the war cry was distinct from the war song (cp.
