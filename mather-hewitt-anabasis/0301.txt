92, 13. φόβον ποιοῦντες: thus frightening; the participle has a touch
of purpose, though it is present; cp. ἐπιδεικνύντες, 66, 24, and see note.
- πρὶν... ἐξικνεῖσθαι : see on εἶναι, 73, 14.

92, 16. μὴ θεῖν: see on ἄγειν, 91, 5. They feared a rally and sudden
attack by the enemy.

93, 1. τὰ μὲν... τὰ δέ: in partitive apposition with ἅρματα.

93, 2. ἡνιόχων: genitive with an adjective of want. In the panic
the charioteers had fled from their posts.

93, 3. προΐδοιεν: saw them coming; for the force of προ-, cp. προ-
αἰσθόμενος, 52, 22, and for the optative, see on ὅπότε . .. βούλοιτο, 56,
20. --- 

διίσταντο : they opened up gaps; cp. the use of this word in 76, 1.
This maneuver was afterwards performed by the soldiers of Alexander
in the battle with the Persians at Arbela; cp. Introd. § 48.— 

ἔστι δ᾽
ὅστις : 507,16 0716; we might expect ἦν, but the use of the past, as in
77, 9, is exceptional.

93, 4. οὐδὲ τοῦτον : οὐδέ is intensive, not even he; like the preceding
οὐδέν, it belongs grammatically with ἔφασαν (see on οὔτε . .. ἔφη, 63,
17), but in sense with παθεῖν. Note the emphatic repetition of nega-
tives in these three lines (see on οὐδενί, 63, 18). The scythe chariots,
fearful as was their appearance, were seldom more efficient than here.
See Introd. § 51.

93, 5. οὐδ᾽... δέ: the negative of καὶ. .. δέ (see 51, 6f.), and no
one else either, strengthened by οὐδείς, 1. 6.

93, 8. νικῶντας, διώκοντας : in indirect discourse, that the Greeks
had conquered and were pursuing; the present of νικάω and some
other verbs often refers to a continuous state rather than to an act, and
the present may then be translated as the perfect of the corresponding
act 2; as ‘I am victorious over’ or ‘I have conquered.’ — 

τὸ καθ᾽ αὑτούς: sc. μέρος, the division opposite them.

93, 9. ἡδόμενος: concessive.

93, 10. οὐδ᾽: see on |. 4.— 

ὧς: distinguish from ὡς .3

93, 11. συνεσπειραμένην: circumstantial participle of manner.

93, 12. ἐπεμελεῖτο: watched to see, followed by an indirect question.

93, 13. ᾔδει αὐτὸν ὅτι... ἔχοι: see on ἀπήγγειλε . .. κρίσιν, 81, 17.

93, 15. ἔχοντες : translate as the main verb, hold their own center
