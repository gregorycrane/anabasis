to the optative, as does the final clause (originally ἵνα... ὠφελῶ), after
a past tense. For the subjunctive retained, cp. ἐντυγχάνωσιν, l. 2. τι
is cognate accusative. — ἀνθ᾽ ὧν εὖ ἔπαθον: the full form would be ἀντὶ
τούτων ἃ εὖ ἔπαθον ; the antecedent is omitted, while the relative, as often
in English, is attached to the preposition and attracted to the case of the
omitted word; in return for the benefits which I had received from
him. 

64, 25. ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου : εὖ ἔπαθον, as passive of εὖ ἐποίησα,1 takes the
genitive of agent. — ἐπεί : causal. — ὑμεῖς: emphatic by contrast with
ἐμοί, 1. 15, and expressed only for that reason.

65, I. ἀνάγκη: sc. ἐστί. — προδόντα: goes in sense with μοι, but
agrees with the omitted subject of the infinitive; see on λαβόντα, 55, 4.

65, 2. φιλίᾳ: dative of means with ypdouar; cp. ablative of means with
utor in Latin. — ψευσάμενον: proving false.

65, 3. εἰ: whether, introducing an indirect question.2 — δίκαια: what
ts right (lit., right things). —δ' οὖν: i.e. whether right or wrong; see
on 59, 9.

65, 4. ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ: a conditional relative clause equivalent to a more
vivid future condition ; 3 sc. πάσχειν with δέῃ. Distinguish ὅ τι from ὅτι."

65, 5. οὐδείς: see on οὐδενί, 63, 18.

65, 6. προδοὺς... εἱλόμην: use two finite verbs, betrayed and chose;
cp. the translation of συλλέξας, 52, 25.

65, 7. ὑμεῖς ἐμοί... ἐγὼ... ὑμῖν: observe the emphasis of the pro-
nouns and the resulting strong antitheses. — ἐμοί: indirect object of a
verb of obeying.

65, 8. σὺν... ἕψομαι: well accompany. 

65, 9. πατρίδα: predicate accusative. The fact that he was an exile,
a man without a country, lends added significance to the word.

65, 10. ἄν: not with οἶμαι, —for it is never found with the present
indicative, — but with εἶναι, expressing in indirect discourse the apodosis
of a less vivid future condition, of which σὺν ὑμῖν represents the prota-
sis. The ἄν of the direct discourse is retained.5 — τίμιος: if the sub-
ject of an infinitive is omitted because it is the same as the subject of
the principal verb (see on ἰέναι, etc., 64, 5), a predicate adjective or
