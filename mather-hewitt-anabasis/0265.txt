1, 3] : NOTES 253

66, 2. δῆλον [ἐστίν] ὅτι: often equivalent to an adverb and printed
as one word, δηλονότι. --- οὕτως ἔχει. .. ὥσπερ: 25 precisely the same as;
for ἔχω with an adverb instead of εἰμί with an adjective, see on εὐνοϊκῶς
ἔχοιεν, 52,9; οὕτως anticipates ὥσπερ, which is more precise than ὡς.

66, 3. ἡμεῖς: sc. ἐσμέν, not a common omission.

66, 5. ἡμῖν: dative depending on the idea of giving in μισθοδότης. —
ἀδικεῖσθαι: subject omitted because it is the same as that of the princi-
pal verb; see on ἰέναι, etc., 64, 5.

66, 6. ὥστε... ἐθέλω: 566 οἡ ὥστε... εἶναι, 52, 7. ---- μεταπεμπομένου
αὐτοῦ: the genitive absolute implying concession! is often strength-
ened by καί or καίπεῤ.3

65, 7. rdpéytorrov : adverbial accusative ; so ravra, 1. 8.— alo-yvvdpevos :
from a feeling of shame, circumstantial participle of cause ; 80 δεδιώς, ]. 8.

. 66, 8. epevopévos: participle in indirect discourse agreeing with the
subject.2 The tense expresses action completed at the time of the main
verb, and in direct discourse would be the perfect indicative.

66, 9. δίκην ἐπιθῇ : 56. wor; an object clause with a verb of fearing.‘
— ov: genitive of cause; the full expression would be δίκην τούτων ἃ (27:
which®) νομίζει ἠδικῆσθαι. On the attraction of the relative to the case
of its omitted antecedent, see on dv@ dv, 64, 24.

66, 10. Soxet: wpa is the subject, the personal construction (see on
λέγεται ᾿Απόλλων, 57, 4) being usual with doxéw in the meaning seem,
be thought ; the impersonal construction is often preferable in English, as, _
zt seems to me not tobe atime. The infinitive is the object of doxet and
in indirect discourse (hence the negatives ovy, o8dZ; see on μή, 54, 7)-
With doxet meaning zt seems best an infinitive is the Subject and not i in
indirect discourse. — xabedSav, dpedetv: depend on wpa.®

66, 11. fav airav: genitive with a verb of neglecting.7— 8 τι χρή:
indirect questions are often introduced by the indefinite relative.

66,12. avrot: adverb. — oxerréov : verbal adjective (Lat. vzdendum) in
the impersonal construction.’ Translate zf seems to me that it ts necessary
to consider how, etc. etvaris the subject of doxe? and in indirect discourse.
