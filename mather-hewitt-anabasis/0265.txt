1, 3] : NOTES 253

66, 2. δῆλον [ἐστίν] ὅτι: often equivalent to an adverb and printed
as one word, δηλονότι. --- οὕτως ἔχει. .. ὥσπερ: 25 precisely the same as;
for ἔχω with an adverb instead of εἰμί with an adjective, see on εὐνοϊκῶς
ἔχοιεν, 52,9; οὕτως anticipates ὥσπερ, which is more precise than ὡς.

66, 3. ἡμεῖς: sc. ἐσμέν, not a common omission.

66, 5. ἡμῖν: dative depending on the idea of giving in μισθοδότης. —
ἀδικεῖσθαι: subject omitted because it is the same as that of the princi-
pal verb; see on ἰέναι, etc., 64, 5.

66, 6. ὥστε... ἐθέλω: 566 οἡ ὥστε... εἶναι, 52, 7. ---- μεταπεμπομένου
αὐτοῦ: the genitive absolute implying concession! is often strength-
ened by καί or καίπερ.3

65, 7. τὸ μέγιστον : adverbial accusative ; so πάντα, 1. 8.— αἰσχυνόμενος :
from a feeling of shame, circumstantial participle of cause ; so δεδιώς, l. 8.

66, 8. ἐψευσμένος: participle in indirect discourse agreeing with the
subject.3 The tense expresses action completed at the time of the main
verb, and in direct discourse would be the perfect indicative.

66, 9. δίκην ἐπιθῇ : 56. μοι; an object clause with a verb of fearing.4
— ὧν: genitive of cause; the full expression would be δίκην τούτων ἃ (in:
which5) νομίζει ἠδικῆσθαι. On the attraction of the relative to the case
of its omitted antecedent, see on ἀνθ᾽ ὧν, 64, 24.

66, 10. δοκεῖ: ὥρα is the subject, the personal construction (see on
λέγεται Ἀπόλλων, 57, 4) being usual with δοκέω in the meaning seem,
be thought ; the impersonal construction is often preferable in English, as, _
it seems to me not to be a time. The infinitive is the object of δοκεῖ and
in indirect discourse (hence the negatives οὐχ, οὐδέ; see on μή, 54, 7)-
With δοκεῖ meaning it seems best an infinitive is the Subject and not in
indirect discourse. — καθεύδειν, ἀμελεῖν: depend on ὥρα.6

66, 11. ἡμῶν αὐτῶν: genitive with a verb of neglecting.7— ὅ τι χρή:
indirect questions are often introduced by the indefinite relative.

66,12. αὐτοῦ: adverb. — σκεπτέον : verbal adjective (Lat. videndum) in
the impersonal construction.8 Translate it seems to me that it ts necessary
to consider how, etc. εἶναι the subject of δοκεῖ and in indirect discourse.
