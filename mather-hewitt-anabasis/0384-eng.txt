372 XENOPHON'’S ANABASIS [3, 5

177, 24. SiaBduri: after you cross; with the case, cp. epwpevors,
176, 20.

177, 26. rerpappévyn: which went (English ‘ went’ was originally past
of ‘wend’ = ¢urn).— 6m: repeated from I. 21, to make prominent the
route which was actually taken.

178, 2. Baorréws ... dxovew: see on 135, 26.

178, 5. éwére . . . oweloaivro: for érdray oreiowvrat of direct dis-
course, which is shown by the apodosis émtpecyvuvan (for émipecyvvace
of direct discourse), to be equivalent to a present general condition ;
see on dvvyrat, 52, 3. The tense expresses simple occurrence of the
customary act, not past time.

178, 6. odév, ikelvav: partitive with revas implied as subject of the
infinitive ; op@wy and éavrovs are used as indirect reflexives.?_ For clear-
ness, translate the pronouns as nouns, some of their own people even
had dealings with the Carduchians, and some of the Carduchians with
their people.

178, 9. &kacraxdoe .. . elSévan : that they knew the way in every direction.

178, 12. rovrovs: object of dueAPdvras.2 —%pacav: the captives are
the subject.

178, 14. wopeverOat: serves both as subject of efvas and as object of
eG €Xor.

179, I. @voravro: the subject changes again. — Spas: partitive with
nvixa. This clause, being part of the purpose, is implied indirect dis-
course, representing qvix’ av doxy of direct discourse.

179, 2. trepBodfv: cp. ywpayv, 177, 20, where English also allows the
proleptic construction, but here it is not admissible.

179, 4. Sevmvicayv, rapayy&Ay: in implied indirect discourse, forms
of direct and indirect discourse being used together, as-in 177, 16 f.
Since the tense of deurvyoaev expresses simple occurrence and of zapay-
yéAAy continuance, while the context shows that both refer to the
future, the former is equivalent to a future perfect, the latter to a future.
