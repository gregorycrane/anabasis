force; but the perfect may be used in translation. — épav . . . otidos:

guard of 6000 cavalry, 85, 22 f.

ΟἹ, 13. αὐτῷ μέλει: he was taking care; péAe retains the form
actually used by Clearchus, but the change to the optative would be as
regular as in ἔχοι, 1. 14; see on 81, 3. These words were naturally
interpreted by Cyrus as a promise to comply with the order. The dis-
obedience of Clearchus left Cyrus and his bodyguard unsupported to
contend against overwhelming odds. See Introd. § 14.

91, 14. €xou: in indirect discourse for the present subjunctive éyy of
direct discourse,‘ that all should be well. \f Clearchus had used the
