91, 7. ἡμῖν: dative of agent (which is really a dative of interest 1). —


πεποίηται: the perfect sometimes gains from the context future perfect
force; but the perfect may be used in translation. 

ὁρῶν... στῖφος:
although he saw the crowded mass at the center, i.e. the king’s body-
guard of 6000 cavalry, 85, 22 f.

91, 8. Κύρου: see on Τισσαφέρνους, 56, 5.

ὄντα: participle in
indirect discourse; βασιλέα is its subject.

91, 10. μέσον: in its substantive use, but lacking the article. For
the king’s superiority in numbers, see Introd. § 13.

91, 11. ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως: yet 22 spite of all, notwithstanding all this ; ὅμως
stamps the participle as concessive.2

91,12. μὴ κυκλωθείη: object of a verb of fearing, the optative depend-
ing on the main verb ἡθελεν.3 The present participle denotes action
going on at the time of ἤθελεν.

91, 13. αὐτῷ μέλει: he was taking care; μέλει retains the form
actually used by Clearchus, but the change to the optative would be as
regular as in ἔχοι, 1. 14; see on 81, 3. These words were naturally
interpreted by Cyrus as a promise to comply with the order. The dis-
obedience of Clearchus left Cyrus and his bodyguard unsupported to
contend against overwhelming odds. See Introd. § 14.

91, 14. ἔχοι: in indirect discourse for the present subjunctive ἔχῃ of
direct discourse,4 that all should be well. If Clearchus had used the
future indicative, which is the common construction (see on ἔσται; 52,
2), the future optative would have been required.

91, 15. τὸ μὲν βαρβαρικὸν στράτευμα: that of the king.

91. 16. ὁμαλῶς : -- ἐν ἴσῳ, 1. 2. — ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ: sc. χωρίῳ.

91,17. μένον: participle. 

συνετάττετο. .. προσιόντων: was forming its ranks from those who were still coming up, a state of affairs
resulting from the disorderly way in which they had been marching
(87, 10-14).

91, 18. οὐ πάνν πρός: at some distance from (lit., not very near).

91,20. Ξενοφῶν: this is the first mention of the author. He never
speaks of himself in the first person. Cp. Caesar’s practice, and see
Introd. § 44 end.
