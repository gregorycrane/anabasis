260 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,4

69, 21. ’ABpoxépa: a Doric form.! The genitive is used rather than
the dative because of the influence of dwoordyres. This was the last
addition to the Greek force of Cyrus. See Introd. § 8.

69, 25. wtdAas: the article is omitted because the word is practically
a proper name; cp. Bacwéws, 52,6. This pass is south of Issus, be-
tween the Amanus range and the sea. It was fortified by two walls.
-- ἦσαν δὲ ταῦτα : Xenophon violates more often than any other Attic
writer the rule that a neuter plural subject takes a singular verb.2 ταῦτα
agrees with the predicate substantive reiyy; cp. avry, 53, I.

70,1. τὸ μὲν ἔσωθεν: 50. τεῖχος, defined further by the appositive
phrase τὸ πρὸ τῆς Κιλικῶς. --- pd: on the side of.

70, 2. elye: agrees with the nearer subject (cp. 7, 55, 28), καὶ. ..
φυλακή being added as an afterthought. Syennésis doubtless thought
that he must keep up the appearance of defense in the eyes of Abrocé-
mas, the king’s general (1. 13), who, however, was no more sturdy a
defender than Syennésis. In fact, the fleet rendered the pass untenable.

70, 3. vdakh: subject of éAéyero. — 81a phoou: detween.

70, 4. wAOpov: predicate genitive of measure; cp. 7A€Opwr, 63, I.

subject.’ — ordBtor: see on orddtov, 69, 4.

70, 7. καθήκοντα: υ866, [Κα στενή, 45 a predicate adjective with 7yv;

70,9. widkar: here in its usual meaning, gates; cp. 69, 25. — wapé-
Sov: genitive with ἕνεκα.

70, 10. pereréuaro: translate as pluperfect, for it probably refers
to the summoning of the fleet from Ephesus. Cyrus had foreseen the
possibility of a blockade at the pass, and had prepared to overcome it.
—elow wal &w: both between the two walls and on the Syrian side, so
as to take the Persian in front and rear.
