#260 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,4

69, 21. ᾿Ἁβροκόμα: a Doric form.1 The genitive is used rather than
the dative because of the influence of ἀποστάντες. This was the last
addition to the Greek force of Cyrus. See Introd. § 8.

69, 25. πύλας: the article is omitted because the word is practically
a proper name; cp. βασιλέως, 52,6. This pass is south of Issus, be-
tween the Amanus range and the sea. It was fortified by two walls.
-- ἦσαν δὲ ταῦτα : Xenophon violates more often than any other Attic
writer the rule that a neuter plural subject takes a singular verb.2 ταῦτα
agrees with the predicate substantive τείχη; cp. αὕτη, 53, I.

70,1. τὸ μὲν ἔσωθεν: sc. τεῖχος, defined further by the appositive
phrase τὸ πρὸ τῆς Κιλικῶς. 

πρό: on the side of.

70, 2. εἶχε: agrees with the nearer subject (cp. 7, 55, 28), καὶ. ..
φυλακή being added as an afterthought. Syennesis doubtless thought
that he must keep up the appearance of defense in the eyes of Abroco-
mas, the king’s general (1. 13), who, however, was no more sturdy a
defender than Syennesis. In fact, the fleet rendered the pass untenable.

70, 3. φυλακή: subject of ἐλέγετο. 

διὰ μέσου: detween.

70, 4. πλέθρου: predicate genitive of measure; cp. πλέθρων, 63, 1.

70,5. ἦσαν : agrees with the predicate nominative instead of with its
subject.3 

στάδιοι: see on στάδιον, 69, 4.

70, 6. καθήκοντα: subject of ἦν; see on οὐκ ἔσται, 67, 25.

70, 7. καθήκοντα: used, like στενή, as a predicate adjective with ἦν;
lit., down-reaching. Translate as a verb, extended down (καθῆκε).

70, 8. ἀμφοτέροις : see on ἀμφοτέρω, 51, 4.

70,9. πύλαι: here in its usual meaning, gates; cp. 69, 25. 

παρόδου: genitive with ἕνεκα.

70, 10. μετεπέμψατο: translate as pluperfect, for it probably refers
to the summoning of the fleet from Ephesus. Cyrus had foreseen the
possibility of a blockade at the pass, and had prepared to overcome it.

εἴσω καὶ ἔξω: both between the two walls and on the Syrian side, so
as to take the Persian in front and rear.

70, 1 βιασομένους : to overpower; for the tense, see on ἀποκτενῶν,
51, 15.


εἰ φυλάττοιεν: more vivid future condition in implied indirect
discourse after a past tense μετεπέμψατο, representing ἐὰν φυλάττωσι,
the thought of Cyrus when he sent for the ships. For a similar change
