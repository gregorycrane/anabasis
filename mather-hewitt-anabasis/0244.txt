232 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1.1

ἐποιεῖτο: the tense indicates that the action was prolonged over a
period of time.

52,14. φυλακάς: from φύλαξ οὐ φυλακή? The antecedent is taken
into the relative clause.1 Translate as if we had ὁπόσων φυλακῶν,
which might have been used, of whatever garrisons he had, etc. —
παρήγγειλε: note the force of the preposition, passed the word along,
sent word.

52, 15. Πελοποννησίους: the Greek force of Cyrus was largely com-
posed of Peloponnesians, at this time the best soldiers among the
Greeks. See Introd. §§ 8, 53.

52, 16. ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους: genitive absolute of cause.2
ὡς indicates the cause as that assigned by Cyrus, not by Xenophon; see
on ὡς φίλον, 51, 9, and ὡς ἀποκτενῶν, 51,15. Translate because, as he
said, Tissaphernes was plotting.

52, 17. πόλεσι : See on αὐτῷ, 51, 14.

52, 18. καὶ γάρ: and in fact (γάρ being an adverb), though often it
may best be rendered by for. The theory of an ellipsis (as and [this
was so] for), which could easily be supplied from the context, arose
from the idea that γάρ was always a conjunction. See γάρ in Vocab. —
ἦσαν: with predicate genitive, Aad belonged to (lit., used to be of ).—
Ἰωνικαί: Ionia (see map, frontispiece) contained some of the wealth-
iest and most populous cities in Asia Minor, among them Ephesus,
Miletus, and Smyrna.

52,19. Τισσαφέρνους: predicate genitive of possession.2— τὸ ἀρχαῖον :
adverbial accusative. — ἐκ βασιλέως : ἐκ instead of ὑπό, which is regularly
used of the agent, emphasizes the giver as the source of the gift rather
than as the agent of the giving. Translate having been a gift from the
king.

52, 20. ἀφειστήκεσαν : the pluperfect of ἵστημι is found with or with-
out augment.5

52, 21. Μιλήτου: it was important for Tissaphernes to hold this, the
chief Greek city of Asia Minor, where he had built a fortress. He had
pursued a policy of banishment and execution. See Introd. § 4.

52, 22. προαισθόμενος: aorist, expressing simple occurrence.
