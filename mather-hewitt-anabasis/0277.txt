73,10. ἑκάστῳ δώσειν : cp. πᾶσι δώσειν, 68, 23, and notes. — πέντε
ἀργυρίον μνᾶς: about $112, if, as is likely, not the Attic, but the heavier
Persian mina is meant. Note the genitive of material.

73, 11. ἐπὰν. ... ἥκωσι: a temporal clause referring vividly to the
future, and so equivalent to a more vivid future condition; cp.  ὅ τι ἂν
δέῃ, 65,4. The mood of direct discourse is retained. Since the pres-
ent indicative of ἥκω is equivalent to a perfect (cp. οἴχονται, 71, 7, and
note), the present subjunctive, with its added idea of futurity, has the
force of a future perfect. — τὸν μισθόν: the pay agreed upon (68, 23 f.).

73, 12. ἐντελῆ: predicate; the largess is not to be deducted. 

μέχρι ἂν καταστήσῃ: a temporal clause referring vividly to the future, and
retaining the mood of direct discourse.1 See Introd. § 11 and footnote.

εἶναι: the infinitive is the regular construction with πρίν
in Attic prose if the main verb is affirmative.2— 

τί ποιήσουσιν: both
the interrogative (cp. ὅ τι χρή, 66, 11, and see note) and the mood
of the direct discourse are retained. 

οἱ ἄλλοι: the soldiers of the
other generals.

73,15. πότερον . . . ἤ: an indirect alternative question.3—

οὔ: note the accent.4

73, 17. μοι: see on ἀνδρί, 67, 14. --- 

πεισθῆτε: see on δύνηται, 52, 3.
Since the aorist middle of this verb is not in use, the aorist passive with
middle meaning supplies its place. — 

οὔτε κινδυνεύσαντες οὔτε πονήσαν-
τες: without danger or toil.

73, 18. τῶν ἄλλων... στρατιωτῶν: genitive depending on the idea
of comparison in προτιμήσεσθε ;5
