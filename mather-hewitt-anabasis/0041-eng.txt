LIFE OF XENOPHON 29

love of beauty, justice, and temperance or self-control. From
his military experience he felt the need of good discipline, and
seeing that the democracy at Athens was unable to secure a
stable government, he became convinced that one head or king
was necessary. The result was that he looked to Sparta, with
its cut-and-dried system of education and training, as his model
state, and was prejudiced against Athens.

and accuracy. He has been severely criticised for his neglect
of important events, such as the founding of Megalopolis and of
Messene; but as Holm remarks (History of Greece, III. 14 f.),
he had no gift for universal history, and sometimes failed to
comprehend the significance of matters of which he had no
personal knowledge. The charge that he was partial to the
Spartans is not altogether undeserved, but he blamed them for
their oppression of Thebes, and told other truths not pleasant
for them to read. Although he was not always able to sink
personal or political prejudices, yet on the whole he is “‘a can-
did, amiable writer, who, as a genuine Socratic, eschews all
phrase making, and his critics themselves recognize his excel-
lence by reproducing his best narratives at length.”

Raphael’s fresco, called ‘‘ The School of Athens,” in the Vatican
at Rome, gives at the left of the center of the picture an imagi-
nary representation of Socrates and half a dozen of his pupils
and followers, including Xenophon. Socrates’ has the un-
comely features attributed to him by Alcibiades in Plato’s
Symposium (215), while Xenophon, a fair and modest young
man, stands leaning on his elbow, intently drinking in the words
of the great teacher.
