INTRODUCTION

THE TEN THOUSAND GREEKS
Cause of the Expedition of Cyrus

1. When Darius II., king of Persia, died, in 405 B.c., he left
the throne to his son, Artaxerxes II. A younger son, Cyrus,
who was far more capable and energetic than his brother, had
been confident of being selected by Darius as his successor,
partly because he was the favorite of his mother, Parysatis, who
had great influence over the king, and partly because he was
born after his father came to the throne, whereas Artaxerxes
had been born before the accession.’ So strong was his confi-
dence, that in the early part of 405 B.c. he had put to death two
of his own cousins, who appeared before him without thrusting
their hands into their sleeves —an act of deference shown only
to the king, and serving as a safeguard against attack upon his
person. Darius, who lay sick in Media, upon hearing of this
presumption, had summoned Cyrus to his presence. Not long
after his arrival his father died, refusing — partly perhaps owing
to his recent high-handed conduct—to appoint him his successor.

2. Cyrus’s disappointment was of course known, and his en-
emy, Tissaphernes, took advantage of it to lay an accusation
before Artaxerxes that his brother was plotting to assassinate
him at the ceremonies of coronation. This charge, though dis-
credited by Xenophon (p. 51, l. 13), may well have been true.
Cyrus was not a man to pocket his chagrin, and more than one
king of Persia, including the father of Cyrus himself, had ob-

1 A hope based on this ground was not unreasonable, since the same con-
sideration had contributed to place Xerxes I. on the throne in 486 B.c., to the
exclusion of an older brother not born in the purple.
