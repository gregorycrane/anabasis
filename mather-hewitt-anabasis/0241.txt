usually implying the completion of the action of the participle before
the time of the main verb. Cyrus ad taken Tissaphernes before he
started.1

51,9. ὡς φίλον: as a friend, so he said. By the use of ὡς Xenophon
means to imply that Cyrus, the subject of the sentence, believed, or at
least pretended to believe, that Tissaphernes was his friend, without
implying that Xenophon himself held that opinion. He knew, in fact,
that Tissaphernes was no friend to Cyrus, as we see from 1. 13 f. — τῶν
Ἑλλήνων: of his Greeks, mercenaries in his service. The genitive is
partitive. — ἔχων: wth; a present participle expresses continuance ;
cp. λαβών, l.8. The act of taking preceded the going, but the having
continued. — ὁπλίτας: see Introd. §§ 56,58. These soldiers were taken
as a bodyguard.

51, 10. ἀνέβη: an aorist and a historical present (άναβαίνει, l. 8) are

inhabit a similarly mountainous and isolated country, have been in
demand in more modern times.

51,13. ἐτελεύτησε . . . αὐτῷ: accused Cyrus to his brother of plotting
against him; see Introd. § 2. ὡς introduces indirect discourse following
the idea of saying implied in διαβάλλει, which is historical present.3
Hence the mood4 of ἐπιβουλεύοι.

51,14. τόν: like τοῦ, 1. 3, and τῶν, 1. 9, equivalent to a possessive
pronoun. — αὐτῷ: dative with a compound verb. — ὁ δέ: and he, in Attic
usually indicates a change of subject, a survival of the old use of the
article as a demonstrative pronoun.

51, 15. ὡς ἀποκτενῶν: future participle implying purpose,5 wth the
