1, 1] NOTES 233

52, 23. Ta adrd rabra: note the article.’ Where English uses a
singular, indicating the whole, Greek often employs a plural, emphasiz-
ing the parts. The accusative is cognate, forming this same plan. —
BovAcvopévous: sc. rivas; the participle is supplementary in indirect dis-
course,? the present tense representing the present indicative of direct
discourse. — &woorfjvar: in apposition with airda; it may be introduced
in translation by #amely or that ts.

52, 24. rovs piv... rots 8: some... others; note the difference
in meaning between the article with pév . . . S€8 and the article with
dé alone; cp. 51,14. In either case the article has its original demon-
strative force.

52,25. debyovras: equivalent to a substantive, ertles.— ovddéfas:
since there is no connective (such as xai) codrdinating this participle
with ὑπολαβών, we must subordinate the latter to it, and understand
that the act expressed in toAaBwv was previous to that of ovAAéas,
having taken .. ., he collected . . . and besteged, etc.

53, I. τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας: those who had been banished; see on hev-
yovras, 52,25. éxmimrrw is used as a passive of éxBdAAw* (cp. ἐξέβαλεν,
52, 24).—atry: note the breathing and accent. It agrees in gender
with the predicate substantive, otherwise it would be rovro. .

53,) 2. αὐτῷ: dat. of possessor, and in this again he had, etc. — rod
dOpolfew: for collecting, objective genitive with rpodacis. The infinitive
(as in English, Latin, and other languages) is often used as a noun; at
the same time it may take an object, like a verb.

53, 3- ἀδελφὸς Sv: the ground of the demand; see on duAovon, §2, 4.
— atrod: with this use 5 of ards cp. Ta avrd, 52, 23.

53, 4. So0fAvar, &pxeaw: objects of a verb of asking. — of: = szdz, the
indirect reflexive.® It is accented because emphatic,’ being opposed to
Τισσαφέρνην. --- πόλεις : 5 )]εοἱ οἵ δοθῆναι, that these cities be given.

53) δ. αὐτῶν: [ἢς genitive depends on the idea of ruler contained i in
the verb. — atrg: see on avra, 51,14. —tabra: object of συνέπραττεν,
cobperated with him in this.
