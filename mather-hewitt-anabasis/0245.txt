52, 23. τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα: note the article.1 Where English uses a
singular, indicating the whole, Greek often employs a plural, emphasiz-
ing the parts. The accusative is cognate, forming this same plan. —
βουλευομένους: sc. rivas; the participle is supplementary in indirect dis-
course,2 the present tense representing the present indicative of direct
discourse. — ἀποστῆναι: in apposition with airda; it may be introduced
in translation by namely or that ts.

52, 24. τοὺς μὲν... τοὺς δ᾽: some... others; note the difference
in meaning between the article with μὲν... δέ3 and the article with
δέ alone; cp. 51,14. In either case the article has its original demon-
strative force.

52,25. φεύγοντας: equivalent to a substantive, exiles.— συλλέξας:
since there is no connective (such as καί) codrdinating this participle
with ὑπολαβών, we must subordinate the latter to it, and understand
that the act expressed in ὑπολαβών was previous to that of συλλέξας,
having taken .. ., he collected . . . and besteged, etc.

53, 1. τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας: those who had been banished; see on φεύ-
γοντας, 52,25. ἐκπίπτω is used as a passive of ἐκβάλλω4 (cp. ἐξέβαλεν,
52, 24).—αὕτη: note the breathing and accent. It agrees in gender
with the predicate substantive, otherwise it would be τοῦτο. 

53, 2. αὐτῷ: dat. of possessor, and in this again he had, etc. — τοῦ
ἁθροίζειν: for collecting, objective genitive with πρόφασις. The infinitive
(as in English, Latin, and other languages) is often used as a noun; at
the same time it may take an object, like a verb.

53, 3- ἀδελφὸς ὢν: the ground of the demand; see on φιλοῦσα, §2, 4.
— αὐτοῦ: with this use 5 of αὐτός cp. τὰ αὐτά, 52, 23.

53, 4. δοθῆναι, ἄρχειν: objects of a verb of asking. — οἷ: = sibi, the
indirect reflexive6 It is accented because emphatic,7 being opposed to
Τισσαφέρνην. --- πόλεις : subject of δοθῆναι, that these cities be given.

53,5. αὐτῶν: the genitive depends on the idea of ruler contained in
the verb. — αὐτῷ: see on αὐτῷ, 51,14. —ταῦτα: object of συνέπραττεν,
cooperated with him in this.
