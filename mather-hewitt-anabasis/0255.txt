of Cyrus).— ἔχοντα: the participle implies condition ;! it agrees with
the unexpressed subject of the infinitive. — μή : 566 Οἢ 54, 7. --- ἀποδιδό-
ναι: for the force of ἀπο-, see on ἀπήτουν, 1. 4; translate not to pay his
debts, if he had the money.

59, 7. Συεννέσιος: used as a proper name (see Vocab.). For the
position of the Cilician kings, see Κιλικία in Vocab. It will be seen from
the map that the route of Cyrus lay directly through Cilicia. This fact
put Syennésis in a trying position. As a dependent of the king, his
clear duty was to obstruct and delay the passage of Cyrus by all possi-
ble means. Should he do so, however, and should Cyrus after all suc-
ceed in his attempt on the throne, the Cilician kingdom would be given
to another. So he trimmed between the two rivals, sending one son to:
Cyrus, the other to Artaxerxes. He made a pretense of resisting the
advance of Cyrus, and sent the king assurances of his fidelity. To
Cyrus, on the other hand, he despatched his wife with a large sum of
money and the promise that any resistance to his passage through
Cilicia should be only perfunctory.

59, 8. Κιλίκων: article omitted, as with Midas, 54, 12.

59, 9. δοῦναι: cp. ἀποδιδόναι, 1.6. The queen owed Cyrus nothing.
The fact that the subject of δοῦναι: is not expressed shows that ἐλέγετο
is personal, she was said; cp. λέγεται, 57, 4, and see note. — χρήματα:
it seems likely that Syennésis had promised this beforehand, for other-
wise Cyrus would hardly have started on such a journey with so little
money. — δ᾽ οὖν: at any rate; a common phrase after the mention of a
rumor or an uncertainty.

59, 10. εἶχε: note the augment.2

59, 11. αἁτήν: observe the breathing.3

59, 12. ἐλέγετο: here in the impersonal construction4 (cp. l. 8), its
subject being the phrase indirectly quoted. — τῇ Κιλίσσῃ: for the case,
Cp. αὐτῷ, 53. 5.

59, 16. παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν: dy the roadside; the accusative indicates that
the water flowed beside the road. — κρήνη... καλουμένη : the so-called
spring of Midas.
