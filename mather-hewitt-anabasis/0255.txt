59, 7. Σνεννέσιος: used as a proper name (see Vocab.). For the
position of the Cilician kings, see Kurxia in Vocab. It will be seen from
the map that the route of Cyrus lay directly through Cilicia. This fact
put Syennésis in a trying position. As a dependent of the king, his
clear duty was to obstruct and delay the passage of Cyrus by all possi-
ble means. Should he do so, however, and should Cyrus after all suc-
ceed in his attempt on the throne, the Cilician kingdom would be given
to another. So he trimmed between the two rivals, sending one son to:
Cyrus, the other to Artaxerxes. He made a pretense of resisting the
advance of Cyrus, and sent the king assurances of his fidelity. To
Cyrus, on the other hand, he despatched his wife with a large sum of
money and the promise that any resistance to his passage through
Cilicia should be only perfunctory.
