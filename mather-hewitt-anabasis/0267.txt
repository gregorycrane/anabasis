#255

ἢ δ᾽ ἀγορά, etc.: inserted by Xenophon to show the absurdity of the
advice. The barbarian and the Greek forces of Cyrus were in every
way distinct and not altogether friendly to one another. For the mar-
ket, see Introd. § 60.

67, 3. ἐλθόντας... αἰτεῖν: and for men (sc. τινάς as subject of
αἰτεῖν) to go and ask. For the accusatives with αἰτεῖν, see on 54, 3.

67, 4. ὡς ἀποπλέοιεν: he said ὡς ἀποπλέωμεν, a purpose clause,
changed to optative after εἶπε in implied indirect discourse; see on
πρὶν ἂν... συμβουλεύσηται, 54, 7. —ἐὰν... διδῷ: retains the form of
the direct discourse; the apodosis is αἰτεῖν, which, being dependent
upon εἶπε, acquires the future force suitable for the apodosis of a future
condition. 

67, 5. ὅστις. .. ἀπάξει: relative clause of purpose.1 — φιλία: predi-
gate adjective,2 implying that the country would be hostile to them unless
they were seen to be under the protection of Cyrus. Translate shrough
his country, which would thus become friendly.

67,6. μηδέ: not .. . either. — τὴν ταχίστην: adverbial accusative ; cp.
61, 15.

67, 7. προκαταληψομένους (sc. ἄνδρας 45 object of πέμπειν) : denotes
purpose. — ἄκρα: of Mt. Taurus, through which they had entered Cili-
cia. —  ὅπως μὴ φθάσωσι: purose3; but cp. ὅπως. .. μενοῦμεν, 66, 13.

67, 8. καταλαβόντες: supplementary participle with φθάσωσι; see on
παρών, 51, 5.

67,9. ὧν... χρήματα: many of whose men and much of whose prop-
erty; ὧν is partitive genitive with πολλούς, but possessive genitive with
χρήματα. --- ἔχομεν : with a participle ἔχω is not a mere auxiliary like
English ‘have,’ but keeps its full force4; we have in our possession,
having gained them by plunder. If Syennésis made any search for his
kidnapped Cilicians (64, 2), it had evidently not been very successful.

67. 11. τοσοῦτον : (only) so much, merely, an allusion to Laconian
brevity. This word ordinarily refers to what precedes. — ὡς... στρα-
τηγήσοντα: a circumstantial participle with ὡς is sometimes equivalent
to a participle in indirect discourse,5 let none of you mention me as (i.e.
say that I am) the one who is to hold this command.
