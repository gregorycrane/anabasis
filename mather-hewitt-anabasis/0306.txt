204 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,9

change from the form of direct discourse. Contrast the meaning of
kaxas mpattw! with that οὗ κακῶς ποιῶ, 71, 11.

96, 25. φανερὸς δ᾽ ἦν... πειρώμενος : (ρ. δῆλος ἦν... ἀνιώμενος, 59,
5, and see note. — wowjoeev: in a past general condition, a type fre-
quent in this chapter. The apodosis is zretpwevos, which denotes con-
tinuance in the past (at the time of jv).

97, 1. εὔχοιτο. .. ἔστε νικῴη : in indirect discourse for evyerar... €or
av vixa (a temporal clause equivalent to a more vivid future condition).

Q7, 2. GdeESpevos: returning like for like. But Cyrus had ill requited
his brother’s forbearance, to which he had owed his life (51, 16).

97, 3. kalydp ovv: see on 96, 15. — wdetoron, etc. : translate freely, fo
him far (8n) more were eager to intrust ... than to any other one man
in our time. ἑνί γε avdpi is somewhat parenthetical and modifies wAci-
orot Oy (although grammatically in apposition with aire), ‘the number
of persons who were eager to intrust their possessions to him was the
very (67) greatest, at least for one man.’ trav ép pov is partitive
genitive limiting avre.

97,5. ob... elmor: and yet, of course (dn), nobody would say either.
τοῦτ᾽, which is explained by the appositive clause ὡς . .. εἴα καταγελᾶν,
may be omitted in translation.

97, 8. qv: as in 78, 6, with an infinitive as subject. — wodav: genitive
of separation.

97,9. orepopévouvs: the present passive, as in English ‘deprived,’
has the perfect meaning ; otherwise the form required to denote a condi-
tion or state would be éorepyeévous ; see on éLevypevy, 56, 10. In Persia
severe punishments were in vogue, such as scourging, cutting off the
ears and nose, hewing off the hands and feet, and putting out the eyes.

97. 10. ἐγένετο : zt became possible; the subject is zopeverOar.

97, 11. pydev dbtxodvre: the negative u7 shows the conditional force
of the participle.2 — 70eAev: in a conditional relative clause equivalent
to a simple past condition. In such a clause the optative is more usual,
giving a general meaning, as in 1. 12, where we have the past general
form of conditional relative clause 6 rt rpoywpotn (sc. éxetv.), whatever
zt was to his advantage to have. But such words as oorts, ὅπῃ. etc.,
in themselves convey sufficiently the idea of generality and indefinite-
ness, and so are sometimes found with the indicative.®
