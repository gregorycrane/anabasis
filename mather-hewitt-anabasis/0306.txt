#204 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,9

change from the form of direct discourse. Contrast the meaning of
κακῶς πράττω1 with that of κακῶς ποιῶ, 71, 11.

96, 25. φανερὸς δ᾽ ἦν... πειρώμενος : cp. δῆλος ἦν... ἀνιώμενος, 59,
5, and see note. — 

ποιήσειεν: in a past general condition, a type fre-
quent in this chapter. The apodosis is πειρώμενος, which denotes con-
tinuance in the past (at the time of ἦν).

97, 1. εὔχοιτο. .. ἔστε νικῴη : in indirect discourse for εὔχεται... ἔστ᾽
ἂν νικᾷ (a temporal clause equivalent to a more vivid future condition).

Q7, 2. ἀλεξόμενος: returning like for like. But Cyrus had ill requited
his brother’s forbearance, to which he had owed his life (51, 16).

97, 3. καὶ γὰρ οὖν: see on 96, 15. — 

πλεῖστοι, etc. : translate freely, to
him far (δή) more were eager to intrust ... than to any other one man
in our time. ἑνί γε ἀνδρί is somewhat parenthetical and modifies πλεῖ-
στοι δή (although grammatically in apposition with aire), ‘the number
of persons who were eager to intrust their possessions to him was the
very (δή) greatest, at least for one man.’ τῶν ἐφ᾽ ἡμῶν is partitive
genitive limiting αὐτῷ.

97,5. οὐ... εἴποι: and yet, of course (δή), nobody would say either.
τοῦτ᾽, which is explained by the appositive clause ὡς . .. εἴα καταγελᾶν,
may be omitted in translation.

97, 8. ἦν: as in 78, 6, with an infinitive as subject. — 

ποδῶν: genitive
of separation.

97,9. στερομένους: the present passive, as in English ‘deprived,’
has the perfect meaning ; otherwise the form required to denote a condi-
tion or state would be ἐστερημένους ; see on ἐζευγμένη, 56, 10. In Persia
severe punishments were in vogue, such as scourging, cutting off the
ears and nose, hewing off the hands and feet, and putting out the eyes.

97. 10. ἐγένετο : it became possible; the subject is πορεύεσθαι.

97, 11. μηδὲν ἀδικοῦντι: the negative μή shows the conditional force
of the participle.2 — 

ἤθελεν: in a conditional relative clause equivalent
to a simple past condition. In such a clause the optative is more usual,
giving a general meaning, as in 1. 12, where we have the past general
form of conditional relative clause ὅ τι προχωροίη (sc. ἔχειν.), whatever
it was to his advantage to have. But such words as ὅστις, ὅπῃ. etc.,
in themselves convey sufficiently the idea of generality and indefinite-
ness, and so are sometimes found with the indicative.®
