#256 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1, 3

67, 12. στρατηγίαν: cognate accusative. — μηδείς... λεγέτω: see on
μὴ θαυμάζετε, 64, 14.

67, 13. ἐμοί: the so-called dative of agent1—really a form of the
dative of interest, denoting the one upon whom rests the necessity of
doing the act.

67, 14. ποιητέον: sc. ἐστί and see on σκεπτέον, 66, 12; it is impossi-
ble to determine whether we have here the personal or the impersonal
construction. — 

ὡς: sc. λέγετε from λεγέτω; but say rather that. —

ἀνδρὶ... πείσομαι: the dative is used of the one for whom a person
persuades himself, i.e. the one whom he obeys2; cp. ἐπίστευον γὰρ
αὐτῷ, 55, 16. --- 

ὃν ἂν ἕλησθε: see on ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ, 65, 4. --- 

ἦ δυνατὸν
μάλιστα: sc. ἐστίν, fo the best of my ability.

67, 15. ἄρχεσθαι: passive.

67,16. ὥς τις, etc.: as well as anybody else in the world; 

μάλιστα ἀνθρώπων belongs with ἄρχεσθαι ἐπίσταμαι, and while it is of course
superfluous after ὥς τις καὶ ἄλλος, yet it adds emphasis. ἀνθρώπων is
partitive with the superlative. καὶ is not translatable.

67, 17. ἐπιδεικνύς : 566 on ἐπιδεικνύντες, 66, 24.

67, 18. αἰτεῖν: object infinitive with κελεύοντος ; sc. αὐτούς as direct
object of κελεύοντος. — 

ὥσπερ... Κύρον ποιουμένον: genitive absolute
with ὥσπερ; just as if Cyrus were making the journey back home again.

67, 19. εἴη: impersonal, the subject being αἰτεῖν; indirectly quoted,
but the construction changes at once to direct discourse.

67, 20. παρὰ τούτου: for a different construction of the person depend-
ing on αἰτεῖν, see l. 5.—w: dative of interest implying disadvantage ;
cp. ovdevt, 63, 18, and see note. —

ᾧ .. . πιστεύσομεν : not expressing
a future condition, but a present intention4 of doing something in the
future; if we are thinking of trusting, if we are going to trust.

67,21. ἡγεμόνι: See on αὐτῷ, 55, 16.— 

τί... προκαταλαβεῖν: intensely
ironical, amounting to ‘If we make such senseless and unreasonable
requests of Cyrus, why not ask him to obviate all the difficulties of our
return ?’ Sc. ἡμᾶς as direct object of κωλύει.

67,22. ἣμῖν: dative of interest implying advantage. — 

κελεύειν: object
infinitive with a verb of hindering ; for a different construction, see μὴ
καταπετρωθῆγκαι, 64,9, and note. —ty

ἐγώ: for my part ; see on ὑμεῖς, 64, 25.
