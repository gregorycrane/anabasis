189. 4. @owep: just as. The Greeks were careful always to observe
burial rites, since it was believed that if the body were not buried, the
soul would be refused passage across the Styx. To pay the ferryman,
Charon, an obol (three cents) was put into the mouth of the corpse.
A eulogy was not pronounced at private burials, but was a part of the
ceremonies at public funerals for those who fell in battle. This much
could probably be done for these men. On the other hand, the bath-
ing and anointing of the bodies, the laying out in a white shroud and
crowning with a wreath, as well as the funeral procession, accompanied
by a flute and singing of a dirge, together with the other mourning
customs and burial usages, must all or in large part have been omitted.
