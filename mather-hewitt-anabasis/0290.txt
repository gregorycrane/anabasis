#278 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1, 6

82, 12. οὐδὲν ἀδικηθείς : 55. ἐπιβουλεύων αὐτῷ φανερὸς γέγονε, but
translate merely he had not been wronged at all. 

82, 13. ἄδικος: for the nominative, see on τίμιος, 65, 10. Observe
how the idea of repeated offense is emphasized. Theoretically, no Per-
sian might be put to death for a single crime; his whole life had to be
considered and a balance struck between his good and his evil deeds.

82,14. ἦ γὰρ ἀνάγκη: sc. ἐστίν, really, there's nothing else to do (lit.,
it 7s, in fact, certainly necessary).

82,15. ἂν γένοιο: potential optative, with the implied protasis “if I
should pardon you.” ,

82, 17. ὅτι: see on ὅτι οὔ, 1. 2.

σοί. .. δόξαιμι: should I ever 
again seem so, at least to you. Orontas had at least been consistently
faithful to the king, to whom his allegiance primarily belonged, and it
is possible that the agreements which he had failed to keep with Cyrus
were forced. He stands in favorable contrast with such trimmers as
Syennésis. 

82,18. πρὸς ταῦτα: may be rendered in reply fo this, though Cyrus
addresses the company, not the culprit.

82, 20. ἀπόφηναι: 1 aorist imperative middle. — 

γνώμην ὅ τι σοι δοκεῖ:
either the first word or the last three might be omitted, but they can
all be translated.

82, 23. ἡμῖν: Clearchus identifies himself with the rest of the com-
pany.

82, 24. τὸ κατὰ τοῦτον εἶναι: a substantive infinitive used absolutely 1;
τοῦτον twice repeated, instead of αὐτόν, lends.a touch of contempt. —
ἐθελοντάς: a noun, not a participle, as the accent shows.

82, 28. ἔφη: the subject is Clearchus, giving his account of the
trial. 

82, 26. ἔλαβον... Ὀρόνταν: seized Orontas by the girdle, the Persian
way of sentencing a man to death. ζώνης is partitive genitive with
a verb of taking hold of.2 It would have sufficed for Cyrus alone to
take hold of the girdle, but he may have extended the ceremony to the
rest in order to test their fidelity.

82, 27. ἐπὶ θανάτῳ: thus voting for death (lit., on terms of death, i.e.
on the understanding that it meant his death). 

83, 1. καί: even.

οἷς: its antecedent is the subject of ἐξῆγον. —
