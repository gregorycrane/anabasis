278 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1, 6

82, 12. οὐδὲν ἀδικηθείς : 55. ἐπιβουλεύων αὐτῷ φανερὸς γέγονε, but
translate merely he had not been wronged at all. ὦ

82, 13. &&uxos: for the nominative, see on rijuos, 65, Io. Observe
how the idea of repeated offense is emphasized. Theoretically, no Per-
sian might be put to death for a single crime; his whole life had to be
considered and a balance struck between his good and his evil deeds.

82,14. "H ydp dvayxn: sc. éoriv, really, there's nothing else to do (lit.,
it 7s, in fact, certainly necessary).

82,15. Gv yévoro: potential optative, with the implied protasis “if I
should pardon you.” ,

82, 17. ὅτι: 566 on Gre ov, 1. 2.— ool . . . Sd—aun: should J ever |
again seem so, at least to you. Orontas had at least been consistently
faithful to the king, to whom his allegiance primarily belonged, and it
is possible that the agreements which he had failed to keep with Cyrus
were forced. He stands in favorable contrast with such trimmers as
Syennésis. .

82,18. wpds taira: may be rendered zx reply fo this, though Cyrus
addresses the company, not the culprit.

82, 20. dardgnyvac: I aorist imperative middle. — yvopunv ὅ τι σοι δοκεῖ:
either the first word or the last three might be omitted, but they can
all be translated.

82, 23. ἡμῖν: Clearchus identifies himself with the rest of the com-
pany.

82, 24. td Kara Tobrov elvar: a substantive infinitive used absolutely !;
Tovrov twice repeated, instead of avrov, lends.a touch of contempt. —
€@eXowrds: a noun, not a participle, as the accent shows.

82, 28. ἔφη: the subject is Clearchus, giving his account of the
trial. |

82, 26. DAaPov... Opdvrav: sezzed Orontas by the girdle, the Persian
way of sentencing a man to death. Cavys is partitive genitive with
a verb of taking hold of.2 It would have sufficed for Cyrus alone to
take hold of the girdle, but he may have extended the ceremony to the
rest in order to test their fidelity.

82, 27. ἐπὶ θανάτῳ: thus voting for death (lit., on terms of death, 1.6.
on the understanding that it meant his death). .

83, 1. Kal: even.—ols: its antecedent is the subject of é&jyov. —
