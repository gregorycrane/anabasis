time he disclaims all responsibility for its truth.1 See ws in Vocab.,
and cp. as tAoy, |. 9, and note. —: not the; cp. rév, |. 14.

51,16. eatrnoapévyn: observe the force of the preposition (ot of his
brother's power). The wife of a deceased king held a peculiarly pow-
erful position in the Persian court. She ranked above the king’s chief
wife, and often exercised more authority as queen mother than she had
wielded as queen consort.

52,2. phwore: distinguish from ovzore.2—éorrat: in an object clause
(as distinct from a purpose clause) the future is the usual construction
with dws? after a verb denoting striving or caring for.—éml: with
dative of person, 7 the power of.

52, 3. Stvnrar: the subjunctive is used in the protasis of both pres-
ent general‘ and future more vivid ® conditions. A clear distinction is
always made, however, by the form of the verb used in the apodosis, or
by the context. The recessive accent of dvvyrac is irregular.6— pév:
correlative with 8, 1.5. The measures of Parysatis are set off against
those of Cyrus himself.

52,4. Kipw: cp. aira, 51, 14.— drotea: circumstantial participle
of cause, because she loved.’ For the tense, see on éxwv, 51,9. See
Introd. §§ 1, 5.

52,5. Bactdevovra: the attributive participle. — &duxvetro : a more usual
construction here would be the optative,® but the idea of indefinite-
ness denoted by that mood is sometimes felt to be sufficiently expressed
by the indefinite relative doris. — rdv mapa Baciréws: of those from the
king. The article, with or without a substantive, is often followed bya
prepositional phrase equivalent to an attributive adjective.

52,6. Baoidéws: without the article (see Vocab.).—mévras: owing
to the distributive meaning of darts, it is easy for a word referring back
to it to slip into the plural. adyras serves as object of the participle as
well as of dzreréurrero. — dreréurrero: note the force of the tense ;® for
the voice, cp. peraméurrerat, 51, 53 contrast dzroméprret, 51, 16.
