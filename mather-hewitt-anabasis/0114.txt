New Front

An Enomoty executing the Countermarch.

As the leaders (1) of the files were the best men,
it was desirable that upon the appearance of an
enemy in the rear they should still occupy the
post of danger. Accordingly a change of front was
effected as follows. Each man faced about. The
rear leaders (8) made no further movement than
this, thus remaining in the rear at the completion
of the maneuver. The file leaders (1), passing to
the right of their files, advanced as far to the
front of the rear rank (8) as they had been before
facing about. The second rank (2) fell in behind
the first, the third behind the second, and so on,
until each man was in the same relative position
in his file as at first.
