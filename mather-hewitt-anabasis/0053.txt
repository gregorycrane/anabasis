THE ARMY OF CYRUS 41

Sometimes two spears were carried, one, probably for hurling, the
other for thrusting. Other forms of sword than the &pos were
also used : the cutlass or saber (udéxarpa) was longer and had only
one sharp edge, somewhat curved ; like the é/pos, it hung at the
left side by a strap over the right shoulder; a straight dagger
(éyxetpidtov), or a curved dagger (ξυήλη), was worn by some.

It is clear from the hoplite’s outfit that he could engage only
in close combat.

59. EQUIPMENT OF THE LIGHT INFANTRY AND THE CAVALRY. —
For skirmishing, or fighting with an enemy at some distance, the
light-armed troops and the
cavalry had to be called
upon. Of the former only
the targeteers or peltasts
had defensive armor, con-
sisting of a small, light,
crescent - shaped _ shield
(πέλτη), whence their
name was derived; they
fought with light spears
and possibly a_ sword.
The archers carried a bow
(τόξον), arrows (τοξεύ-
para), and a quiver (dape-

(ἀκόντια) for hurling. At
the center of gravity of these spears a thong (dy«vAy) was attached,
which the thrower wound several times round the spear and
held tight by inserting one or two fingers through a loop at the
end. By sharply twitching the thong at the moment of throw-
ing, he gave a rotary motion to the spear, increasing the accuracy
of aim! (see Fig. 62, p. 196). The slingers were armed only with
slings (cevddva) and leaden bullets (woAvBdides).

1 The same effect is obtained in modern firearms by spirally grooving the bore.
