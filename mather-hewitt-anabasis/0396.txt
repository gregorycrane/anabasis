195, 18. ἐπὶ φάλαγγος: into line of battle. There is no indication
what the formation of Xenophon’s division was before this maneuver,
but if we assume that it had been by companies in column, —z.e. the four
enomoties of each company one behind another, see on 186, 25,—the
new arrangement was effected for each company by the leading enom-
oty’s standing still, while the other three advanced and successively
took position in the line on the left. In like manner any other previous
formation could be brought into line, with the enomoties all side by
side. Thus a long front was opposed to the Carduchians, barring them
from the ford at which the Greeks were crossing (H on the plan).

Even Greek music, a few fragments of which have been preserved, fails
to please modern taste.
