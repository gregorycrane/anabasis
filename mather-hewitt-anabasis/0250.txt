#238 XENOPHON’S ANABASIS [1,2

54, 21. ἐκ: repeated after ἐκβαλεῖν; cp. ‘cast out first the beam out
of thine own eye,’ Matthew 7. 5. In translating, omit the preposition
in the compound verb. — ὡς ἐπὶ τούτους: ostensibly against them ; cp.
ὡς, 51, 9, and see note.

54, 22. βαρβαρικόν, Ἑλληνικόν : 5.0. στράτευμα. --- ἐνταῦθα: thither,
there, i.e. to Sardis, capital of Lydia and chief city of his province.

54, 23. ὅσον... στράτευμα: all the army he had. For the antece-
dent taken up into the relative clause, see on @vAaxas, 52, 14.

55,1. αὐτῷ: see on aire, 53, 2. — συναλλαγέντι πρός : having become
reconciled with ; cp. πρός, 54, 7-

55, 2. τοὺς οἴκοι : Cp. τῶν οἴκοι ἀντιστασιωτῶν, 54, 2. In such an
expression a noun denoting merely men or things is often omitted ;
cp. τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως, 52, 5.—5 εἶχε στράτευμα: what he had in
the way of an army; the antecedent is taken up into the relative
clause.

55, 3- αὐτῷ: see on αὐτῷ, 53, 12. --- προειστήκει: 5866 on ἀφειστήκε-
σαν, 52,20. When the perfect has a present meaning, the pluperfect is
equivalent to the imperfect.1— τοῦ... ξενικοῦ: see on βαρβαρικόν, 54,
22; for the genitive, see on αὐτῶν, 53, 5.

55, 4. ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι: with the position of this attributive phrase cp.
παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ@, 52, 8.— λαβόντα: agrees with the omitted subject of ἥκειν ;
it might have been dative agreeing with Reviga? (cp. συναλλαγέντι, l. 1,
and λαβόντι, 54, 23).

55, 5. ὁπόσοι: with omitted antecedent τοσούτων, depending on πλήν
(cp. 52, 21), except as many as.

55,0. τοὺς φυγάδας : -- τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας, 53, 1.

55, 12. καταπράξειεν : in indirect discourse after a past tense3 repre-
senting ἐὰν καταπράξω of direct discourse. When a subjunctive with ἂν
is changed to the optative, ἂν is omitted.4 — ἐφ᾽ ἅ : in translating supply
the antecedent ταῦτα. —ἐστρατεύετο: he said στρατεύομαι. Such a
change of tense in indirect discourse, while regular in English, is un-
usual in Greek.

55, 13. μή: a verb of promising is sometimes not felt as implying
indirect discourse; the negative of the infinitive is then μή, not οὐ, and
