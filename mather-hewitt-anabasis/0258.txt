ning to betray Cyrus into the hands of the king. The temptation to
do this must have been great. The betrayer of Cyrus would doubtless
be liberally rewarded by the king, and it is a striking indication of his
personal popularity that more treachery was not attempted. The in-
finitive is in indirect discourse.

62, 7. ἐπειρῶντο: made repeated attempts. — εἰσβάλλειν : see on παρα-
γενέσθαι, 54, 11. ---- εἰς τὴν Κιλικίαν : the road to Babylon lay directly
through this mountainous country, where the advance of Cyrus could
easily have been checked. The pass, 3300 feet above sea level, is so
narrow that hardly four men can walk through it abreast. It commands
the entrance into Asia Minor on this side.

62, 8. ἁμαξιτός, ἀμήχανος : feminine.

62,9. εἰσελθεῖν: infinitive with an adjective.1 —στρατεύματι: dative
of relation or interest ; see on 60, 24. — εἴ τις: Observe the accent of the
proclitic.2 — εἰ. . . ἐκώλνεν: a simple condition with conative imperfect,3
tried to prevent.

62, 10. καί: 200, i.e. in addition to the natural difficulties of the pass.
Syennesis stayed there, however, only long enough to keep up appear-
ances, and then, probably by agreement made through his wife with
Cyrus, withdrew and left the strong position undefended.

62, II. τῇ δ᾽ ὑστεραίᾳ: dative of time when.

62, 12. ὅτι: commonly used to introduce indirect discourse depend-
ing on the active of λέγω.4 λελοιπὼς εἴη: he said λέλοιπε, has left;
note the periphrastic form of the optative.5

62, 13. ἐπεὶ ἤσθετο: causal. The aorist indicative in subordinate
clauses of direct discourse, the imperfect (see ἤκουε, 1. 14) and pluper-
fect in both principal and subordinate clauses, tend to remain unchanged
in indirect discourse.6

62,14. ἦν: ἐστί or εἴη would be more usual ; see on ἐστρατεύετο, 55,12.
— εἴσω: on the Cilician side. — ὁρῶν: genitive with an adverb ; cp. Ἀβύ-
δου, 53, 13. — ὅτι: because. — τριήρεις : object of ἔχοντα, its prominent posi-
tion in the sentence being due to its importance in the thought. — ἤκουε:
the imperfect shows that repeated reports came to him, he kept hearing.
