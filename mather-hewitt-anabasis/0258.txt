246 XENOPHON'’S ANABASIS [1,2

ning to betray Cyrus into the hands of the king. The temptation to
do this must have been great. The betrayer of Cyrus would doubtless
be liberally rewarded by the king, and it is a striking indication of his
personal popularity that more treachery was not attempted. The in-
finitive is in indirect discourse.

62, 7. trepavro: made repeated attempts. — elo Baddaw : see Οὔ παρα-
γενέσθαι, 54, 11. ---- εἰς τὴν Κιλικίαν : the road to Babylon lay directly
through this mountainous country, where the advance of Cyrus could
easily have been checked. The pass, 3300 feet above sea level, is so
narrow that hardly four men can walk through it abreast. It commands
the entrance into Asia Minor on this side.

62, 8. ἁμαξιτός, ἀμήχανος : feminine.

62,9. eloedOetv: infinitive with an adjective.1—orparevpari: dative
of relation or interest ; see on 60, 24. — e€ rg: Observe the accent of the
proclitic.2 — et. . . é&eéAvev: a simple condition with conative imperfect,’
tried to prevent.

62, 10. Kal: 200, ¢.e. in addition to the natural difficulties of the pass.

ances, and then, probably by agreement made through his wife with
Cyrus, withdrew and left the strong position undefended.

62, 12. 8m: commonly used to introduce indirect discourse depend-
ing on the active of A€yw.4 —dehovmds ely: he said A€Aoere, has left;
note the periphrastic form of the optative.®

62, 13. éwel yoero: causal. The aorist indicative in subordinate
clauses of direct discourse, the imperfect (see yxove, 1. 14) and pluper-
fect in both principal and subordinate clauses, tend to remain unchanged
in indirect discourse.®

62,14. 4v: éori or ety would be more usual ; see on ἐστρατεύετο, 55,12.
— low: on the Cilician side. — dpav: genitive with an adverb ; cp. ’Afv-
Sov, 53, 13. — Sr: because. — tprfpes : object of éxovra, its prominent posi-
tion in the sentence being due to its importance in the thought. — ἤκονε:
