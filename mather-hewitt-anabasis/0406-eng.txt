and Chirisophus in their jokes were twitting on facts. The Spartan
boys were taught to steal as a part of their training for strategy in war.
There is a familiar story of a boy who stole a young fox, and hiding it
under his tunic allowed it to tear out his vitals without betraying him-
self. In Athens at this period public life appears to have been honey-
combed with corruption. Many of the officials were mere demagogues
who throve on graft and bribery. Chirisophus is sarcastic in his use of
Kpaticro., a word properly referring to earlier times. when the nobles,
who styled themselves “the good ” and “the best,’’ had control of the
government.
