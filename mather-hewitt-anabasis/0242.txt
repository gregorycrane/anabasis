#230 XENOPHON'’S ANABASIS [1.1

time he disclaims all responsibility for its truth.1 See ὡς in Vocab.,
and cp. ὡς φίλον, 1. 9, and note. —: not the; cp. rév, |. 14.

51, 16. ἐξαιτησαμένη: observe the force of the preposition (out of his
brother's power). The wife of a deceased king held a peculiarly pow-
erful position in the Persian court. She ranked above the king’s chief
wife, and often exercised more authority as queen mother than she had
wielded as queen consort.

52,2. μήποτε: distinguish from οὕποτε.3 --- ἔσται: in an object clause
(as distinct from a purpose clause) the future is the usual construction
with ὅπως after a verb denoting striving or caring for.—ἐπί: with
dative of person, in the power of.

52, 3. δύνηται: the subjunctive is used in the protasis of both pres-
ent general4 and future more vivid 5 conditions. A clear distinction is
always made, however, by the form of the verb used in the apodosis, or
by the context. The recessive accent of δύνηται is irregular.6— μέν:
correlative with 8, 1.5. The measures of Parysatis are set off against
those of Cyrus himself.

52,4. Κύρῳ: cp. αὐτῷ, 51, 14.— φιλοῦσα: circumstantial participle
of cause, because she loved.7 For the tense, see on ἔχων, 51,9. See
Introd. §§ 1, 5.

52,5. βασιλεύοντα: the attributive participle. —  ἀφικνεῖτο: a more usual
construction here would be the optative,8 but the idea of indefinite-
ness denoted by that mood is sometimes felt to be sufficiently expressed
by the indefinite relative ὅστις. — τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως: of those from the
king. The article, with or without a substantive, is often followed by a
prepositional phrase equivalent to an attributive adjective.

52,6. βασιλέως: without the article (see Vocab.).—πάντας: owing
to the distributive meaning of ὅστις, it is easy for a word referring back
to it to slip into the plural. πάντας serves as object of the participle as
well as of ἀπεπέμπετο. ---- ἀπεπέμπετο : note the force of the tense ;9 for
1ῃ6 νοΐςε, ορ. μεταπέμπεται, 51, κ ; contrast ἀποπέμπει, 51, 16.
