52, 7. ὅστε... εἶναι: expresses the result as fending to follow the
action of οὕτω διατιθείς, with such treatment as to make them, etc. It
implies, but does not definitely state, that they were actually more
friendly to him. To emphasize the attainment of a result, Greek uses
gore with the indicative.1— αὐτῷ: depends on the adjective; the indi-
rect reflexive αὑτῷ might have been used.3— μᾶλλον: rather (not form-
ing a comparative with φίλους).

52, 8. καί: see καί kal, 51, 6.— τῶν βαρβάρων: genitive with a verb
of caring for.2 We might expect ἐπεμελεῖτο ὡς οἱ παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ βάρβαροι
πολεμεῖν, etc., but the substantive is transferred to the main clause and
made to depend on ἐπεμελεῖτο. Any one not a Greek was styled a
βάρβαρος, and even now foreigners traveling in Greece are sometimes
so called. — παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ: a prepositional phrase used attributively, like
παρὰ βασιλέως, l. 6. ---- ὡς ... εἴησαν: an object clause depending on
a past tense of a verb of caring for. The regular Attic usage would be
ὅπως with the future indicative, as in 1. 2. ὡς instead of the more usual
ὅπως in this construction is peculiar to Xenophon. See Introd. § 43,
p. 33-— πολεμεῖν: depends on an adjective of ability.®

52,9. τε. .. καί: wot only... but also. — εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν: not
infrequently Greek uses ἔχω intransitively with an adverb instead of
εἰμί with an adjective, to hold (keep, stay) in a well-disposed condition,
rather than 20 de well disposed. But translate in the latter way. —rhv:
see on Τόν, 51, 14.

52, 10. ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο : as best (lit., most) he could.

52, 11. ἐπικρυπτόμενος : circumstantial participle of manner. Note the
voice.6 The whole phrase may be translated as secretly as he could.
See Introd. § 6.—ὅπως . .. λάβοι: a purpose clause depending on a
past tense. ὅτι: often used, like ὡς, to strengthen a superlative
adjective or adverb; cp. Latin guam in quam plurimi, as many as
possible.

52, 13. ὧδε: bear in mind the difference between ὧδε and οὕτω. In
this instance ὧδε includes everything to the end of the chapter. —
