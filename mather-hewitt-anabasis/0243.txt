1, 1] NOTES 231

52, 7. dove. . . evar: expresses the result as fending to follow the
action of ovrw dvaribets, with such treatment as to make them, etc. It
implies, but does not definitely state, that they were actually more
friendly to him. To emphasize the attainment of a result, Greek uses
gore with the indicative.1— atrg@: depends on the adjective; the indi-
rect reflexive avr@ might have been used.?— p&ddov: rather (not form-
ing a comparative with diAovs).

52, 8. wal: see on kal, 51, 6.— rdw BapBdpwv: genitive with a verb
of caring for.2 We might expect érepeXetro ὡς οἱ παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ βάρβαροι
πολεμεῖν, etc., but the substantive is transferred to the main clause and
made to depend on émepeAciro. Any one not a Greek was styled a
BapBapos, and even now foreigners traveling in Greece are sometimes
so called. — wap éavr@: a prepositional phrase used attributively, like
παρὰ βασιλέως, ]. 6. ---- ὡς ... εἴησαν: δὴ object clause depending on
a past tense of a verb of caring for. The regular Attic usage would be
O7vrws with the future indicative, as in 1. 2. ὡς instead of the more usual
orws in this construction is peculiar to Xenophon. See Introd. § 43,
P- 33-— woAepetw: depends on an adjective of ability.®

52,9. te... wal: wot only... but also. — eovoixds orev: not
infrequently Greek uses éyw intransitively with an adverb instead of
eiui with an adjective, fo hold (keep, stay) in a well-disposed condition,
rather than 20 de well disposed. But translate in the latter way. —rhv:
see On roy, 51, 14.

52, 10. ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο : “5 best (lit., most) he could.

52, 11. ἐπικρυπτόμενος : circumstantial participle of manner. Note the
voice.6 The whole phrase may be translated as secretly as he could.
See Introd. § 6.—8mrws . .. λάβοι: a purpose clause depending ona
past tense.’—8r: often used, like ws, to strengthen a superlative
adjective or adverb; cp. Latin guam in quam plurimi, as many as
possible.

52, 13. oS: bear in mind the difference between ®de and ovrw. In
this instance &de includes everything to the end of the chapter. —
