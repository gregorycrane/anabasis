63, 19. &ἐλθεῖν: he said ἦλθον.

63, 2ο. Κύρῳ ἰέναι : 56. εἰς χεῖρας.—ἧ: his, Cp. τοῦ, 51, 3.

63, 21. ἔπεισε: for a finite mood with πρίν, see on πρὶν ἂν ; . . συμ-
βουλεύσηται, 54, 7; the indicative is used of a definite past act.

63, 22. &ἔλαβε: the context makes it clear that Syennésis is the
subject. If there were room for doubt, the new subject would be
expressed.

63, 25. παρὰ βασιλεῖ: af court; see on βασιλέως, 52, 6. :

63, 27. χρυσοῦν (with ἀκινάκην): gold-mounted. The first three
presents mentioned here could be given only by the king (see Cyropae-
dia 8. 2. 8). Cyrus was thus playing the king already. — στολὴν
Περσικήν: probably the κάνδυς, a long silk robe with sleeves. See
Fig. 2, p. 18.

64, 1. διαρπάζεσθαι : ἴῃ the same construction as the preceding accu-
satives (cp. δοθῆναι, 53, 4), and the assurance that his country should
not again be plundered. Ue had in mind the looting of Tarsus. — ἣν
. . . ἐντυγχάνωσιν: more vivid future condition1 in indirect discourse ;
plural because it refers to Syennésis and any or all of his followers.
Cyrus said qv που ἐντυγχάνητε, and the subjunctive is retained.

64, 2. ἀπολαμβάνειν: forms the apodosis of the condition; in the
same construction as διαρπάζεσθαι, 1. 1, the right to take back. Cyrus
favors the Greeks in not giving strict orders that the booty be returned
at once.

64, 4. CHAPTER 3. οὐκ ἔφασαν: 566 On οὔτε . . . ἔφη, 63, 17. ---
ἱέναι: with future meaning in indirect discourse (see Vocab., and cp.
Eng. “I am going,” “are you going?” etc., which refer to the future more
often than to the present). In 1. 7 and in προϊέναι, l. 9, the infinitive is
not in indirect discourse, and so has no idea of time; see on wapayeve-
oa, 54, 11. — τοῦ πρόσω: genitive of place.2

64, 5. ὑπώπτενον: their suspicions were now brought to a head,
because to reach Pisidia from Tarsus they would have to retrace their
steps and march west. — ἰέναι, μισθωθῆναι: observe that, unlike the
usage of Latin, the subject of an infinitive in indirect discourse is
omitted if it is the same as the subject of the principal verb.

64, 6. ἐπὶ τούτῳ: on this understanding. — πρῶτος... Κλέαρχος...
