At
this
time,
when
nearly
two
months
had
passed,
a
mission
came
from
Thimbron,
Charminos
the
Laconian
and
Polyneicos.
They
said
that
the
Lacedaimonians
had
resolved
to
make
a
campaign
against
Tissaphernes,
and
Thimbron
had
sailed
for
the
war;
that
he
wanted
this
army,
and
offered
pay
one
daric
per
man
per
month,
two
for
a
lieutenant,
and
four
for
a
captain.
As
soon
as
these
men
arrived
Heracleides
heard
they
were
visiting
the
army,
and
said
to
Seuthes,
“Here’s
a
great
piece
of
luck!
The
Lacedaimonians
want
the
army
and
you
don’t;
then
give
them
the
army,
and
they
won’t
ask
for
any
more
pay—they
will
just
clear
out
of
the
country.”
Seuthes,
on
hearing
this,
told
him
to
bring
the
men
in.
They
said
they
were
visiting
the
army;
and
he
said
he
would
give
it
up,
and
wished
to
be
their
friend
and
ally,
and
invited
them
to
a
banquet,
which
was
magnificent.
But
he
did
not
invite
Xenophon
or
any
other
of
the
captains.
The
Lacedaimonians
asked,
“What
sort
of
a
man
is
Xenophon?”
“Not
a
bad
sort,”
he
said,
“but
too
fond
of
his
men.
So
much
the
worse
for
him!”
“What,”
said
they,
“does
he
harangue
the
men?”
Heracleides
said,
“I
should
think
he
does!”
“Well,
then,”
they
said,
“perhaps
he
will
object
to
our
carting
them
off?”
“Just
you
collect
them,”
said
Heracleides,
“and
promise
the
pay;
much
they
will
care
for
him!
Off
they
will
run
with
you.”
“Then
how
could
we
get
them
together?”
they
wanted
to
know.
“To-morrow,”
said
Heracleides,
“early
in
the
morning
we'll
take
you
to
them;
and
I
am
sure,”
says
he,
“as
soon
as
they
see
you,
they
will
run
together
glad
enough.”
Thus
ended
that
day.
Next
morning
the
Laconians
came
to
the
army,
led
by
Seuthes
and
Heracleides,
and
the
men
collected.
Then
two
Laconians
said,
“The
Lacedaimonians
have
resolved
to
make
war
on
Tissaphernes,
who
has
wronged
you;
then
if
you
will
go
with
us,
you
shall
punish
your
enemy,
and
every
man
shall
receive
a
daric
per
month,
every
lieutenant
two
darics,
and
every
captain
four.”
The
men
were
delighted
to
hear
it.
At
once
an
Arcadian
rose
to
accuse
Xenophon.
Seuthes
was
there
also,
wanting
to
hear
what
would
be
done,
and
stood
with
an
interpreter
within
hearing;
but
he
understood
himself
a
good
deal
of
Greek.
Then
the
Arcadian
said:
“We
should
have
been
with
you
long
ago,
Lacedaimonians,
if
Xenophon
had
not
persuaded
us
and
brought
us
here,
and
what
a
place!
Through
this
dreadful
winter
we
have
been
campaigning
night
and
day
without
rest,
and
he
enjoys
our
labours;
Seuthes
has
made
him
a
rich
man
privately,
and
he
keeps
our
pay
from
us.
If
I
could
only
see
this
man
punished
and
stoned
for
dragging
us
about,
I
should
call
it
pay
in
full,
and
I
wouldn’t
worry
about
my
labours.”
After
this
another
got
up
and
another,
just
the
same,
and
at
last
Xenophon
spoke:
“Then
there
is
nothing
a
man
must
not
expect
in
this
world,
as
it
seems,
when
I
stand
here
now
to
be
accused
by
you,
and
in
something
where
I
know
in
my
conscience
that
I
have
used
my
utmost
endeavours
on
your
behalf.
I
was
already
on
my
way
home,
when
I
was
turned
aside
by
hearing
of
you—not
because
I
heard
you
were
in
luck,
not
at
all;
no,
I
heard
you
were
at
your
wits’
end,
and
hoped
to
help
you
if
I
could.
When
I
came
to
you,
Seuthes,
who
is
here
present,
sent
messenger
after
messenger
to
me,
and
made
great
promises
to
me
if
I
would
persuade
you
to
join
him.
Yet
I
did
not
try
to
do
that,
as
you
know
yourselves;
I
led
you
to
the
place
where
I
thought
you
could
cross
most
quickly
to
Asia.
I
believed
that
to
be
best
for
you,
and
you
wished
it,
as
I
knew.
Then
Aristarchos
came
with
ships
of
war
and
stopt
that.
“Next
I
did
the
natural
thing,
I
suppose,
and
called
you
together
that
we
might
consider
what
we
must
do.
Aristarchos
ordered
you
to
go
into
the
Chersonese.
Seuthes
tried
to
persuade
you
to
join
his
expedition:
you
heard
both,
and
all
said
go
with
Seuthes,
all
voted
for
that.
What
wrong
did
I
do
you,
then,
when
I
led
you
where
you
all
decided
to
go?
However,
Seuthes
deceived
you
about
your
pay:
if
I
praise
him
for
that,
you
would
have
a
right
to
hate
me
and
accuse
me;
if
I
am
now
wholly
estranged
from
him,
having
been
formerly
his
especial
friend,
what
right
could
you
have
to
blame
me
for
this
estrangement
when
I
chose
you
instead
of
Seuthes?
“Well,
perhaps
you
might
say
that
it
is
possible
I
got
your
money
from
Seuthes,
and
I
am
just
pretending.
Then
one
thing
is
clear:
if
Seuthes
paid
me
anything,
he
did
not
expect
to
have
to
pay
it
again
to
you,
and
so
throw
away
what
he
gave
to
me.
Not
so,
I
think;
if
he
gave
it,
he
would
give
it
on
the
understanding
by
paying
me
less
he
might
avoid
paying
you
more.
Very
well,
if
you
believe
that
happened,
you
have
the
power
here
and
now
to
make
the
transaction
worth
less
for
both
of
us
by
demanding
and
getting
the
money
from
him.
It
is
clear
that
if
I
have
had
any
of
it
from
him,
he
will
ask
for
it
back,
and
quite
right
too,
if
I
do
not
carry
out
the
transaction
for
which
I
took
the
bribe.
“Far
from
it—I
have
nothing
of
yours.
I
swear
to
you
solemnly
by
gods
and
goddesses
all,
that
I
have
not
even
what
Seuthes
promised
me
personally.
He
is
present
himself,
and
hears
me,
and
knows
whether
I
am
forsworn.
What
will
surprise
you
more,
I
swear
that
I
did
not
receive
even
what
the
other
captains
did,
no
indeed,
not
even
as
much
as
some
of
the
under-officers.
Why
did
I
behave
so?
I
believed,
gentlemen,
that
the
better
I
helped
him
to
bear
the
poverty
he
had
then,
the
better
friend
he
would
be
when
he
should
become
powerful.
But
now
I
see
him
in
his
prosperity,
and
now
I
understand
his
mind,
“One
might
well
ask
whether
I
am
not
ashamed
to
be
deceived
like
a
fool.
Upon
my
word,
I
should
be
ashamed
indeed
if
an
enemy
had
deceived
me;
but
for
a
friend,
I
think
it
more
disgraceful
to
deceive
than
to
be
deceived.
If
we
can
speak
of
precautions
against
a
friend,
I
know
we
took
every
precaution
to
give
him
no
just
excuse
not
to
pay
what
he
promised;
for
we
have
done
him
no
wrong,
we
never
were
slack,
never
dawdled
over
what
he
asked
us
to
do,
“But,
you
might
say,
security
ought
to
have
been
taken,
that
he
might
not
have
been
able
to
deceive
if
he
wished.
Then
listen
to
me
while
I
tell
what
I
should
never
have
said
in
his
presence,
if
you
had
not
shown
yourselves
altogether
stupid
or
else
wholly
ungrateful
to
me.
Just
remember
what
a
state
you
were
in
when
I
brought
you
out
to
Seuthes.
You
went
to
Perinthos,
but
you
couldn’t
get
in—
Aristarchos
the
Lacedaimonian
shut
the
gates
in
your
faces.
You
were
outside
in
the
open
air,
it
was
midwinter,
you
had
a
market,
but
there
was
little
to
buy
and
little
to
buy
with;
you
were
forced
to
remain
in
Thrace—for
shipsof-war
were
there
to
prevent
a
crossing;
but
if
you
did
remain,
you
would
be
in
an
enemy
country;
there
were
large
forces
of
cavalry
against
you,
and
large
forces
of
light
troops,
and
what
had
we?
A
force
of
heavy-armed
men,
yes,
and
if
we
had
taken
it
in
a
body
to
the
villages
perhaps
we
could
have
got
some
corn,
nothing
much;
but
to
pursue
and
capture
prisoners
or
sheep—we
had
nothing
at
all
for
that:
I
found
no
regular
body
at
all
of
horse
or
targeteers
with
you.
In
such
a
necessity,
if
I
had
asked
no
pay
at
all
from
Seuthes
and
only
got
him
for
an
ally,
when
he
had
the
cavalry
and
light
troops
which
you
wanted,
would
you
have
thought
I
made
a
bad
bargain
for
you?
Only
by
sharing
in
those,
of
course,
you
found
any
amount
of
corn
in
the
villages,
because
the
Thracians
were
compelled
to
run
away
in
a
hurry,
and
you
took
more
cattle
and
captives.
Enemies
—we
never
saw
one
of
them
any
longer
as
soon
as
the
horse
was
added
to
us;
before
that,
the
enemy
followed
us
boldly
with
horse
and
light
infantry,
and
we
could
not
break
into
small
bodies
and
scatter
anywhere
to
get
more
abundant
provisions.
And
if
the
man
who
provided
this
safety
for
you
did
not
really
give
you
very
large
pay
for
this
safety,
that
is
really
dreadful
treatment!
And
that’s
why
you
think
I
must
never
leave
the
place
alive!
“And
how
are
you
off
now?
You
are
leaving
this
place;
you
have
spent
the
winter
in
the
midst
of
abundance,
and
whatever
you
got
from
Seuthes
is
so
much
to
the
good,
for
what
you
spent
the
enemy
paid.
Yes,
and
while
this
was
your
lot,
you
saw
none
of
your
comrades
killed
and
you
lost
none
alive.
Besides,
any
fine
feat
you
may
have
done
against
the
barbarians
in
Asia,
you
have
that
safe
and
sound,
haven’t
you?
And
now
you
have
won
a
new
glory
by
fighting
the
Thracians
in
Europe
too
and
conquering
them.
I
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
thank
God
for
the
very
things
you
complain
of,
since
they
are
blessings.
“So
much
for
you;
now
be
so
kind
as
to
consider
my
side
of
the
question.
When
I
set
out
for
home
that
time
I
had
your
good
wishes
and
best
thanks,
and
through
you
I
had
a
high
reputation
among
all
parts
of
our
nation.
I
was
trusted
by
the
Lacedaimonians,
or
they
would
not
have
sent
me
back
to
you.
I
go
now,
reprobated
by
you
before
the
Lacedaimonians,
and
disliked
by
Seuthes
on
your
account,
whom
I
hoped
to
serve
along
with
you
and
to
find
in
him
an
honourable
refuge
for
myself
and
my
children,
if
I
should
have
any.
And
you,
on
whose
behalf
I
have
made
many
enemies
and
those
more
powerful
men
than
I
am,
you
for
whom
I
have
never
ceased
working
and
still
work
now
to
do
you
what
good
I
can,
that
is
your
feeling
for
me.
Well,
you
have
me.
I
did
not
avoid
you,
I
did
not
run
from
you
and
let
you
catch
me,
If
you
do
to
me
what
you
say,
you
will
have
slain
a
man
who
has
spent
many
a
sleepless
night
for
you,
who
has
shared
many
toils
and
dangers
with
you,
in
my
turn
and
out
of
turn,
one
who
when
the
gods
were
gracious
has
set
up
very
many
trophies
of
the
barbarians
by
your
side,
and
strained
against
you
with
all
my
strength
to
save
you
from
becoming
enemies
to
any
of
your
countrymen,
Indeed
even
now
it
is
possible
for
you
without
reproach
to
travel
where
you
please
both
by
land
and
sea.
But
you,
at
the
time
when
you
have
everything
open
to
you,
when
you
are
sailing
to
the
very
place
you
have
long
desired,
when
great
potentates
want
you
and
you
can
see
your
pay,
when
your
leaders
are
the
Lacedaimonians,
by
common
consent
the
dominant
power—this
is
exactly
the
time
you
think
to
be
just
right
for
putting
me
to
death.
But
not
in
the
time
of
our
troubles:
you
have
the
best
of
memories,
you
never
forget.
No,
then
you
called
me
father,
and
vowed
always
to
speak
of
me
as
your
benefactor.
But
these
men
who
have
come
for
you
now
are
not
hard-hearted
themselves.
As
I
take
it,
they
will
not
think
the
better
of
you
when
you
behave
so
to
me.”
He
spoke,
and
ceased.
Then
Charminos
the
Lacedaimonian
rose
and
spoke.
He
said:
“No,
be
the
twa
gads!
I
for
one
think
you
have
no
right
to
complain
of
this
man.
I’m
a
witness
myself
on
his
side.
What
Seuthes
said
when
I
and
Polynicos
asked
about
Xenophon,
what
sort
of
a
man
he
was,
what
he
said
was
he
had
only
one
fault
to
find;
he
said
he
was
too
fond
of
the
soldiers,
that’s
the
reason
why
he
didn’t
get
on
with
us
Lacedaimonians
or
with
himself.”
On
this
an
Arcadian
got
up,
Eurylochos
of
Lusia,
and
said
to
the
two
envoys,
“My
opinion
is,
that
you
begin
being
our
captains
here,
and
first
get
us
the
pay
from
Seuthes
whether
he
will
or
no,
but
don’t
take
us
away
before.”
Polycrates
the
Athenian
said
(prompted
by
Xenophon),
“Why,
man,”
says
he,
“I
see
Heracleides
here
too!
That
man
was
entrusted
with
the
property
which
we
won
by
hard
work,
and
he
sold
it,
and
did
not
give
the
proceeds
either
to
Seuthes
or
to
us.
He
stole
it
and
keeps
it
himself!
Let’s
get
hold
of
him,
if
we
have
any
sense;
for
this
fellow,”
says
he,
“is
not
a
Thracian,
he’s
a
Hellene
and
he
cheats
his
own
countrymen!”
When
Heracleides
heard
this,
he
was
dismayed;
he
found
Seuthes,
and
said,
“Let’s
get
out
of
the
claws
of
these
men,
if
we
are
wise.”
They
jumped
on
their
horses
and
galloped
away
to
their
own
camp.
Then
Seuthes
sent
Abrozelmes,
his
own
interpreter,
to
Xenophon,
and
asked
him
to
stay
behind
with
a
thousand
men-at-arms,
and
promised
to
give
him
the
forts
by
the
sea
and
others
besides.
Then
he
told
him
as
a
secret,
which
he
had
heard
from
Polynicos,
that
if
he
came
into
the
hands
of
the
Lacedaimonians
Thibron
certainly
meant
to
put
him
to
death.
Many
others
sent
similar
messages
to
Xenophon,
and
they
warned
him
he
was
calumniated
and
he
must
look
out.
On
hearing
all
this
he
took
two
victims
and
sacrificed
to
Zeus
the
King,
asking
whether
it
was
better
to
stay
with
Seuthes
on
the
terms
he
offered,
or
to
leave
along
with
the
army.
The
answer
was
to
leave.
