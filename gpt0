BOOK
ONE
1.1
Dareios
and
Parysatis
had
two
sons,
the
elder
Artaxerxes,
the
younger
Cyros,
When
Dareios
was
ill
and
expected
to
die,
he
wished
both
his
sons
to
be
present.
The
elder
was
there,
as
it
happened,
but
Cyros
had
to
be
sent
for
from
the
province
where
he
was
governor
and
general-in-chief
over
all
the
troops
that
are
stationed
in
the
plain
of
the
Castolos.
Cyros
then
came
up
to
the
capital,
taking
with
him
Tissaphernes
as
his
friend,
and
he
brought
up
300
men-at-arms
of
the
Hellenic
mercenaries
under
their
captain
Xenias,
a
Parrhasian.
But
when
Dareios
died
and
Artaxerxes
succeeded,
Tissaphernes
slandered
Cyros
to
his
brother
and
said
he
was
plotting
against
him.
The
king
believed
him,
and
seized
Cyros
to
put
him
to
death,
but
his
mother
begged
him
off
and
sent
him
back
to
his
province.
When
Cyros
got
clear
of
this
danger
and
disgrace,
he
determined
never
again
to
be
in
his
brother’s
power,
but
to
make
himself
king
instead,
if
he
could.
Cyros
had
his
mother
behind
him
to
begin
with,
for
she
loved
him
more
than
the
reigning
Artaxerxes.
Whenever
anyone
came
to
Cyros
from
the
court,
he
treated
them
all
so
well
that
they
went
away
friends
to
him
rather
than
to
the
king.
And
the
native
troops
he
had
he
carefully
trained
to
take
the
field,
and
made
them
loyal
to
himself.
Hellenic
mercenaries
again
he
assembled
in
as
great
force
as
possible,
secretly,
in
order
to
keep
the
king
quite
unprepared.
This
is
how
he
collected
them.
He
sent
word
to
the
governors
of
all
the
garrisons
he
had
in
various
cities,
to
enlist
as
many
Peloponnesians
as
they
could
find,
and
the
best,
pretending
that
Tissaphernes
was
plotting
against
the
cities,
For
in
fact
the
Ionian
colonies
had
belonged
to
Tissaphernes
originally,
being
given
him
by
the
king;
but
then
they
had
gone
over
to
Cyros,
all
except
Miletos.
In
Miletos,
however,
Tissaphernes
had
got
wind
beforehand
that
the
people
were
going
to
do
the
same,
and
revolt
to
Cyros,
and
he
had
killed
some
and
banished
others.
Cyros
gave
refuge
to
the
banished
men,
and
collected
an
army,
and
laid
siege
to
Miletos
by
land
and
sea,
and
tried
to
restore
the
banished:
this
was
another
excuse
for
him
to
assemble
his
army.
He
sent
also
to
the
king,
and
asked
him
as
his
brother
to
give
him
those
cities
rather
than
let
Tissaphernes
rule
over
them;
and
his
mother
worked
to
help
him.
Thus
the
king
did
not
see
the
plot
against
himself,
but
he
thought
that
war
with
Tissaphernes
was
why
he
spent
so
much
money
on
the
army.
He
did
not
worry
about
fighting
between
Cyros
and
Tissaphernes,
especially
as
Cyros
was
careful
to
send
in
the
proper
tribute
from
the
cities
that
Tissaphernes
had
in
his
province.
Another
army
was
being
collected
for
him
in
the
Chersonese,
opposite
Abydos,
in
the
following
manner.
Clearchos
was
a
Lacedaimonian
exile;
Cyros
met
him,
and
admired
him,
and
gave
him
10,000
darics.
a
Persian
gold
coin
weighing
about
128
grains
Using
this
money
to
collect
a
force,
he
made
war,
with
the
Chersonese
as
his
base,
upon
the
Thracians
who
are
settled
farther
up
above
the
Hellespont,
and
since
he
thus
helped
the
Hellenes,
the
Hellenic
cities
willingly
contributed
to
the
support
of
his
men.
In
such
way
this
army
again
was
being
secretly
kept
for
Cyros.
Besides,
Aristippos
the
Thessalian
was
his
friend;
and
he
being
hard
pressed
by
the
opposing
party
at
home,
came
to
Cyros
and
asked
him
to
provide
three
months’
pay
for
2,000
men,
which
he
thought
would
be
enough
to
get
the
better
of
his
rivals.
Cyros
gave
him
six
months’
pay
for
4,000,
and
requested
him
not
to
make
friends
with
his
rivals
without
consulting
him.
There
again
was
an
army
in
Thessaly
being
kept
ready
unnoticed.
Proxenos
the
Beotian
was
another
friend;
Cyros
begged
him
to
get
as
many
men
as
he
could
and
join
him,
since
he
was
about
to
attack
the
Pisidians
who
were
making
themselves
a
nuisance
to
his
country.
Two
other
friends,
Sophainetos
the
Stymphalian
and
Socrates
the
Achaian,
he
told
to
join
him
with
as
large
forces
as
possible,
because
he
was
going
to
make
war
on
Tissaphernes
along
with
the
Milesian
exiles.
And
so
they
did.
1.2
When
he
thought
the
time
had
come
to
march
up
country
he
made
the
excuse
that
he
wanted
to
expel
the
Pisidians
from
the
land
altogether;
and
he
summoned
both
his
national
forces
and
the
Hellenic
to
meet
for
this
purpose.
He
also
sent
word
to
Clearchos
to
bring
up
all
his
army;
and
to
Aristippos,
to
make
terms
with
his
rivals
at
home
and
to
send
the
whole
army
to
himself.
He
ordered
Xenias
also,
who
was
in
general
command
of
the
foreign
troops
in
the
cities,
to
bring
them
all
up
except
as
many
as
were
enough
to
garrison
the
fortresses,
and
except
those
who
were
besieging
Miletos;
the
exiles
he
told
to
come
too,
promising
them
that
if
he
should
succeed
in
his
purpose,
he
would
not
cease
until
he
could
restore
them
to
their
home.
They
obeyed
gladly,
for
they
trusted
him,
and
proceeded
to
Sardis
under
arms.
Accordingly
Xenias
came
also
to
Sardis
with
about
4,000
men-at-arms;
Proxenos
was
there
with
1,500
and
500
light-armed
men,
Sophainetos
the
Stymphalian
with
1,000
men-at-arms,
Socrates
the
Achaian
with
about
500,
Pasion
the
Megarian
with
300
men-at-arms
and
300
targeteers;
he
and
Socrates
had
been
among
those
besieging
Miletos.
This
was
the
force
that
assembled
at
Sardis;
Tissaphernes
took
note
of
this,
and
thought
it
was
too
large
for
the
Pisidians,
and
so
he
marched
to
the
king
as
quickly
as
possible
with
500
horse.
And
the
king
made
preparations
to
resist
Cyros’s
plan,
when
he
heard
about
it
from
Tissaphernes.
Cyros
then,
with
the
forces
I
have
mentioned,
set
out
from
Sardis.
Three
stages,
22
leagues,
The
parasang
was
a
little
over
three
miles.
The
plethron
is
about
10%
feet:
I
call
it
100.
The
men-at-arms
are
hoplites
in
heavy
armour,
the
targeteers

brought
him
as
far
as
the
River
Maiandros.
The
river
is
200
feet
wide,
with
a
bridge
supported
on
floating
vessels.
Crossing
this,
he
travelled
through
Phrygia,
one
stage,
8
leagues,
to
Colossai,
an
inhabited
city,
large
and
prosperous.
There
he
stayed
seven
days;
and
there
Menon
the
Thessalian
joined
him,
with
1,000
men-at-arms
and
500
targeteers,
Dolopians
and
Ainanians
and
Olynthians.
Thence
he
passed
on
three
stages,
20
leagues,
to
Celainai,
an
inhabited
city
of
Phrygia,
large
and
prosperous.
There
Cyros
had
a
palace,
and
a
great
park
full
of
wild
animals,
which
he
used
to
hunt
on
horseback
when
he
wished
to
exercise
himself
and
his
horses.
Through
this
park
flows
the
River
Maiandros,
and
the
source
is
in
the
palace;
it
flows
also
through
the
city
of
Celainai.
There
is
also
a
palace
of
the
Great
King
in
Celainai,
deserted,
at
the
source
of
the
River
Marsyas
under
the
Acropolis;
this
river
also
flows
through
the
city
and
discharges
into
the
Maiandros:
the
width
of
the
Marsyas
is
25
feet.
There
it
is
said
Apollo
flayed
Marsyas,
Marsyas
the
satyr
picked
up
Athena's
hoboy,
which
she
threw
away
because
it
made
her
look
ugly
to
blow
it;
and
he
was
so
pleased
with
himself
that
he
challenged
Apollo
to
a
match.
who
had
challenged
him
to
a
music-match,
and
hung
up
the
skin
in
the
cave
where
the
source
is;
and
therefore
the
river
is
named
Marsyas.
This
palace
and
the
fortress
Xerxes
is
said
to
have
built
when
he
came
back
after
the
defeat
in
Greece.
There
Cyros
remained
thirty
days;
and
Clearchos
the
Lacedaimonian
exile
joined
him,
with
1,000
men-at-arms,
and
800
Thracian
targeteers,
and
200
Cretan
bowmen.
At
the
same
time
Sosis
the
Syracusan
came
in
with
300
men-at-arms,
and
Sophainetos
with
1,000
from
Arcadia.
There
Cyros
held
a
review,
and
counted
the
Hellenic
mercenaries
in
the
park;
there
were
in
all
11,000
men-at-arms,
and
about
2,000
targeteers.
From
this
place
he
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
to
Peltai,
an
inhabited
city,
where
he
stayed
three
days.
In
this
halt
Xenias
the
Arcadian
celebrated
the
feast
Lycaia
and
held
sports;
the
prizes
were
golden
skin-scrapers,
used
in
the
bath,
and
usually
made
of
iron
and
Cyros
looked
on
at
the
contest.
From
there
he
marched
two
stages,
12
leagues,
to
Potters’
Market,
an
inhabited
city,
on
the
boundary
of
Mysia.
From
there
he
marched
three
stages,
30
leagues,
to
the
plain
of
the
Caystros,
an
inhabited
city,
where
he
stayed
five
days.
More
than
three
months’
wages
were
now
due
to
the
soldiers,
and
they
came
often
to
his
door
to
ask
for
it.
He
talked
of
expectations
and
put
them
off;
but
he
was
clearly
annoyed,
for
it
was
not
the
way
of
Cyros,
if
he
had,
not
to
give.
At
this
place
came
to
Cyros
Epyaxa,
wife
of
Syennesis,
King
of
the
Cilicians,
and
she
was
said
to
have
given
him
large
sums
of
money,
so
Cyros
paid
the
army
four
months’
wages.
The
Cilician
queen
had
a
bodyguard
of
Cilicians
and
Aspendians
;
and
Cyros
was
said
to
have
been
intimate
with
her.
Thence
he
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
to
Thymbrion,
an
inhabited
city.
There
by
the
side
of
the
road
was
the
spring
named
after
Midas
the
Phrygian
king,
where
Midas
was
said
to
have
caught
the
Satyr
by
mixing
wine
with
the
water.
Thence
two
stages,
10
leagues,
to
Tyriaion,
an
inhabited
city,
where
he
stayed
three
days.
The
Cilician
is
said
to
have
begged
him
to
show
her
a
display
of
the
army.
So
he
reviewed
his
troops,
national
and
Hellenic,
on
the
plain.
He
ordered
the
Hellenes
to
put
themselves
in
battle
array
after
their
own
fashion,
each
captain
commanding
his
own
men.
So
they
paraded
four
deep;
Menon
held
the
right
wing
and
Clearchos
the
left,
the
others
in
the
centre.
First
Cyros
inspected
the
nationals;
they
marched
past
in
troops
of
horse
and
companies
of
foot.
Then
the
Hellenes,
Cyros
driving
by
in
a
car
and
the
Cilician
in
her
state
wagon.
All
the
men
wore
bronze
helmets
and
purple
tunics
and
greaves,
and
had
their
shields
uncovered.
When
he
had
driven
by
them
all
he
halted
his
car
in
front
of
the
central
line,
and
sent
Pigres
the
interpreter
to
the
Hellenic
captains,
with
the
order
to
present
pikes
and
advance
the
whole
line.
The
captains
passed
on
the
order
to
the
men;
and
when
the
trumpet
sounded
they
presented
pikes
and
advanced.
Then
the
pace
quickened.
The
men
doubled
towards
the
tents
with
cheers
of
their
own
accord.
There
was
a
panic
among
the
national
troops,
and
the
Cilician
fled
in
her
wagon,
and
the
people
from
the
market
fled
too,
leaving
their
goods
behind.
The
Cilician
was
amazed
to
see
the
brilliancy
and
discipline
of
the
army;
and
Cyros
was
delighted
when
he
saw
how
the
natives
were
scared
by
the
Hellenes.
From
this
place
he
went
three
stages,
20
leagues,
to
Iconion,
the
last
city
of
Phrygia,
where
he
stayed
three
days.
Thence
he
marched
through
Lycaonia
five
stages,
30
leagues.
He
gave
this
part
over
to
the
Hellenes
to
despoil
as
enemy
country.
After
that
Cyros
sent
the
Cilician
back
to
her
own
country
the
quickest
way,
and
with
her
he
sent
Menon
and
his
men.
But
Cyros
marched
along
with
the
others
through
Cappadocia
four
stages,
25
leagues,
to
Dana,
an
inhabited
city,
large
and
prosperous,
where
they
stayed
three
days.
Here
Cyros
put
to
death
a
Persian,
Megaphernes,
one
who
wore
the
royal
purple,
the
highest
rank,
others
wearing
purple
facings
only
and
another
high
official,
one
of
the
lieutenant-governors,
on
the
charge
of
conspiracy
against
him.
After
that
they
tried
to
break
into
Cilicia;
but
the
entry
was
a
carriage
road,
very
straight
and
impossible
for
an
army
to
enter
if
anyone
resisted.
Syennesis
was
said
to
be
on
the
heights
guarding
the
pass,
and
Cyros
therefore
stayed
one
day
in
the
plain,
But
next
day
news
came
that
Syennesis
had
left
the
heights
when
he
found
that
Menon’s
force
already
was
in
Cilicia
and
behind
the
mountains,
and
that
a
fleet
of
war
under
Tamôs
was
sailing
round
to
Cilicia
from
Tonia,
a
fleet
that
belonged
to
the
Lacedaimonians
and
to
Cyros
himself.
So
Cyros
came
up
that
pass
into
the
mountains
without
opposition,
and
saw
the
tents
where
the
Cilicians
had
been
on
the
watch.
After
that
he
came
down
into
a
large
and
beautiful
plain
well
watered,
and
full
of
all
sorts
of
trees
and
vines,
bearing
plenty
of
sesamum,
too,
and
millet
and
barley
and
wheat;
a
strong
and
lofty
wall
of
mountains
surrounds
it
everywhere
from
sea
to
sea,
Coming
down
he
marched
through
this
plain
four
stages,
25
leagues,
to
Tarsus,
a
city
of
Cilicia
both
large
and
prosperous,
where
was
the
palace
of
Syennesis,
King
of
Cilicia;
through
the
midst
of
the
city
flows
a
river
called
Cydnos,
200
feet
across.
The
inhabitants,
with
Syennesis,
had
left
it
and
gone
to
a
strong
place
in
the
hills,
except
those
who
had
goods
for
sale;
those
who
lived
by
the
sea
also
remained,
and
those
in
Soli
and
Issos.
Epyaxa,
the
wife
of
Syennesis,
had
reached
Tarsus
five
days
before
Cyros;
but
in
crossing
the
mountains
two
companies
of
Menon’s
force
had
been
lost;
some
said
they
had
been
cut
down
by
the
Cilicians
while
plundering,
others
that
they
had
been
left
behind
and
could
not
find
their
party,
and
lost
their
way
and
wandered
about
till
they
perished.
In
any
case
they
were
a
hundred
men-at-arms.
When
the
others
came
in
they
were
enraged
at
the
destruc-
tion
of
their
comrades,
and
plundered
Tarsus
and
the
palace
there.
When
Cyros
entered
the
place
he
summoned
Syennesis;
but
Syennesis
said
he
had
never
yet
put
himself
in
the
hands
of
one
stronger
than
himself,
and
he
would
not
come
to
Cyros
then,
until
his
wife
persuaded
him
and
got
promises
of
safety.
After
this,
when
they
met,
Syennesis
gave
Cyros
large
sums
of
money
for
his
campaign,
and
Cyros
gave
him
such
gifts
as
are
thought
honourable
for
a
king,
a
horse
with
golden
bit
and
bridle,
and
a
gold
necklace
and
bracelets,
and
a
gold
scimitar
and
Persian
robes,
and
promised
no
more
to
plunder
the
country;
he
should
have
back
the
captives
whenever
he
found
any.
1.3
There
Cyros
and
the
army
stayed
twenty
days,
for
the
soldiers
said
they
would
go
no
farther;
they
already
suspected
that
they
were
marching
against
the
king,
and
said
they
had
not
been
hired
for
that.
Clearchos
first
tried
to
compel
his
men
to
go
on;
but
they
pelted
him
and
his
animals
as
soon
as
they
started,
and
Clearchos
had
a
narrow
escape
then
of
being
stoned
to
death,
but
after
he
saw
he
could
not
compel
them
he
called
a
public
meeting
of
all
the
men.
He
began
by
standing
before
them
for
some
time
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks,
and
the
men
were
silent
in
surprise;
then
he
spoke
as
follows:
“Men
and
comrades,
don’t
be
surprised
that
I
am
deeply
hurt
by
what
has
happened.
Cyros
has
been
my
friend;
when
I
was
banished
from
my
country,
he
treated
me
with
respect,
and
also
gave
me
ten
thousand
darics;
and
when
I
received
this
money
I
did
not
put
it
by
as
my
own,
or
spend
it
on
luxuries,
but
I
spent
it
on
you.
Then
first
I
made
war
on
the
Thracians,
and
with
your
help
punished
them
for
the
wrongs
of
Hellas.
I
drove
them
from
the
Chersonese,
where
they
wished
to
rob
our
countrymen
of
their
land.
Afterwards,
when
Cyros
called
me,
I
marched
with
you
to
him,
that
if
he
needed
me
I
might
show
my
gratitude
for
his
benefits.
But
since
you
will
not
march
with
me,
I
must
of
necessity
either
desert
you
and
enjoy
his
friendship,
or
else
deceive
him
and
stay
with
you.
If
it
will
be
right
I
do
not
know;
but
in
any
case
I
will
choose
you,
and
with
you
suffer
whatever
I
must
suffer.
No-one
shall
ever
say
that
I
led
Hellenes
against
savages,
and
then
deserted
the
Hellenes
and
chose
the
friendship
of
savages;
but
since
you
will
not
obey
me,
I
will
go
with
you
and
suffer
whatever
I
must
suffer.
For
I
consider
that
you
are
my
country
and
my
friends
and
comrades;
and
with
you
I
think
I
shall
be
honoured
wherever
I
may
be,
but
without
you,
I
think
I
am
not
able
either
to
help
a
friend
or
hurt
an
enemy.
Where
you
go
there
I
will
go
also:
that
is
my
resolve.”
So
he
spoke,
and
the
soldiers
all
cheered
him,
both
his
own
and
the
others
who
heard,
when
he
said
he
would
not
march
against
the
king;
and
more
than
two
thousand
from
Xenias
and
Pasion
took
their
arms
and
baggage
and
encamped
beside
Clearchos.
Cyros
was
very
much
upset
and
did
not
know
what
to
do.
He
sent
for
Clearchos,
but
Clearchos
did
not
wish
to
go
himself;
he
sent
him
a
message,
however,
unknown
to
the
soldiers,
and
told
him
not
to
worry,
all
would
turn
out
well;
but
he
should
go
on
sending
for
him,
and
he
would
refuse
to
come.
After
that
he
collected
his
own
men,
and
those
who
had
joined
him,
and
anyone
else
who
liked
and
spoke
to
them
after
this
fashion:
“Men
and
comrades,
it
is
clear
now
how
things
are
between
us
and
Cyros:
we
are
no
longer
his
men,
since
we
do
not
follow
him;
and
he
no
longer
finds
our
pay.
He
thinks
you
are
in
the
wrong,
I
know;
and
that
is
why
I
will
not
go
when
he
sends
for
me.
The
chief
reason
is,
I
am
ashamed
because
my
conscience
tells
me
I
have
broken
faith
with
him
altogether;
next
I
am
afraid
that
if
he
catches
me
he
may
punish
me
for
the
wrong
he
thinks
I
have
done.
Then
I
think
it
is
no
time
for
us
to
sleep
or
neglect
ourselves;
we
must
make
some
plan.
As
long
as
we
remain
here
I
think
we
must
arrange
to
be
as
safe
as
possible;
or
if
we
decide
to
go
at
once,
we
must
arrange
to
go
as
safely
as
possible
and
to
find
provisions,
for
without
this
there’s
no
good
in
a
captain
and
no
good
in
a
man.
But
this
man
is
worth
much
as
a
friend,
and
very
dangerous
as
an
enemy:
he
has
forces
in
foot
and
horse
and
fleet,
which
we
all
see
and
understand
quite
well.
Indeed,
I
don’t
think
we
should
sit
here
any
longer.
So
now’s
the
time
to
say
what
is
best;
speak
up,
someone.”
He
said
this
and
ceased;
and
people
got
up,
some
of
themselves
to
tell
what
they
proposed,
others
prompted
by
him,
who
pointed
out
what
a
mess
they
were
in
without
the
support
of
Cyros,
whether
they
stayed
or
marched.
One
indeed
pretended
he
was
in
a
hurry
that
they
should
march
for
Hellas
as
quickly
as
they
could,
and
told
them
to
choose
captains
with
all
expedition,
if
Clearchos
did
not
want
to
lead
them;
provisions
they
must
buy
(there
was
a
market
in
the
national
army)
and
pack
up
their
traps;
they
must
go
and
ask
Cyros
for
ships
to
sail
in;
if
he
would
not
grant
this,
ask
him
for
a
guide
to
see
they
travelled
among
friends.
If
he
would
not
give
so
much
as
a
guide,
they
must
put
themselves
in
order
at
once
and
send
men
on
ahead
to
occupy
the
heights,
or
else
Cyros
might
get
there
first,
or
the
Cilicians—don’t
forget
we
have
taken
many
of
them
and
their
goods.
After
this
speech
Clearchos
got
up
and
said:
“Me
to
be
captain
of
this
march—let
no-one
say
such
a
thing!
I
see
many
reasons
why
I
cannot
do
that.
But
I
will
be
ruled
by
the
man
you
choose,
whoever
he
may
be,
to
show
you
I
know
how
to
obey
as
well
as
any
man
on
earth!”
After
this
another
got
up,
and
showed
how
silly
the
man
was
who
advised
them
to
ask
Cyros
for
ships.
Did
they
think
he
would
turn
his
feet
backwards?
How
silly
to
ask
for
a
guide
from
a
man
when
we
have
just
spoilt
his
business!
And
if
we
trust
the
guide
he
gives
us,
what
hinders
him
from
giving
orders
to
occupy
the
heights
first?
“I
should
be
sorry
myself
to
embark
in
any
ships
he
might
give.
Suppose
he
sinks
us
and
the
ships!
I
should
be
afraid
to
follow
the
guide
he
might
give.
Suppose
he
leads
us
to
a
place
we
can’t
get
out
from!
I
should
wish
to
get
away
without
his
consent,
unnoticed;
and
that
is
impossible.
I
tell
you
all
this
is
nonsense.
I
propose
that
Clearchos
go
with
suitable
people,
and
ask
what
Cyros
means
to
do
with
us;
and
if
his
business
now
is
like
what
he
did
with
other
hired
soldiers
before,
that
we
follow
him
too
and
show
ourselves
no
worse
than
those
whom
he
brought
up
country
earlier;
but
if
the
business
is
bigger
than
the
other,
and
more
difficult
and
dangerous,
demand
that
he
either
persuade
us
and
we
will
go,
or
be
persuaded
and
let
us
depart
in
friendship.
In
that
way,
if
we
follow
him
we
shall
be
friends
and
follow
willingly,
and
if
we
depart
we
shall
depart
safely.
Let
them
report
to
us
whatever
he
says;
he
will
listen
and
decide
accordingly.”
This
was
agreed;
they
chose
the
persons
and
sent
them
with
Clearchos,
and
they
asked
Cyros
the
questions
which
the
army
thought
proper.
He
answered,
that
he
heard
an
enemy
of
his,
Abrocomas,
was
on
the
River
Euphrates
twelve
stages
away;
he
said
he
wanted
to
march
against
this
man,
and
if
he
was
there
he
wished
to
punish
him,
but
if
he
were
gone,
we
will
consider
what
to
do.
The
chosen
men
reported
this
answer
to
the
soldiers;
they
had
a
suspicion
that
he
was
leading
them
against
the
king,
still
all
the
same
they
decided
to
follow.
But
they
asked
more
pay;
and
Cyros
promised
to
pay
them
all
half
as
much
again
as
they
had
had
before,
instead
of
one
daric,
one
and
a
half
each
month
per
man;
but
as
to
the
king,
no-one
heard
one
single
word
about
that,
in
public
at
least.
1.4
From
that
place
he
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
to
the
River
Pharos,
which
was
300
feet
across.
Thence
one
stage,
5
leagues,
to
the
River
Pyramos,
1
furlong
wide.
Thence
two
stages,
15
leagues,
to
Issoi,
the
last
inhabited
city
of
Cilicia,
lying
by
the
seaside,
a
large
and
prosperous
place,
where
they
stayed
three
days.
There
the
ships
from
the
Peloponnese
joined
Cyros,
thirty-five
with
a
Lacedaimonian
admiral,
Pythagoras.
Tamôs
the
Egyptian
piloted
them
from
Ephesos,
and
he
brought
five
and
twenty
other
ships
belonging
to
Cyros,
with
which
he
had
besieged
Miletos
while
it
was
friendly
to
Tissaphernes
and
fought
against
him
for
Cyros,
A
Lacedaimonian
Cheirisophos
was
also
in
this
fleet,
sent
for
by
Cyros;
and
he
brought
700
men-at-arms,
whose
captain
was
on
the
side
of
Cyros.
The
ships
were
anchored
opposite
Cyros’s
tent.
There
were
also
the
Hellenic
mercenaries
from
Abrocomas,
400
men-at-arms;
they
had
left
him
and
come
over
to
Cyros
for
his
expedition
against
the
king.
From
that
place
he
marched
one
stage,
5
leagues,
to
the
Gates
of
Cilicia
and
Syria.
These
were
two
forts;
the
inner
one,
in
front
of
Cilicia,
was
held
by
Syennesis
and
a
Cilician
garrison;
the
other
one,
in
front
of
Syria,
was
said
to
be
held
by
a
king’s
garrison.
Between
the
two
forts
runs
a
river
named
Carsos,
roo
feet
wide.
The
whole
distance
between
the
two
forts
was
3
furlongs.
No
force
could
get
through;
for
the
pass
was
narrow,
and
the
walls
ran
down
to
the
sea,
and
above
were
high-clambering
rocks:
both
fortresses
had
gates.
Because
of
this
pass
Cyros
had
sent
for
the
ships;
he
would
land
forces
both
within
and
without
the
gates,
and
fight
his
way
through
the
enemy
if
they
were
protecting
the
Syrian
Gates,
which
he
expected
Abrocomas
to
do
with
a
large
army.
But
Abrocomas
did
not
do
this:
when
he
heard
Cyros
was
in
Cilicia,
he
left
Phoenicia
and
marched
to
the
king,
with
an
army
of
300,000
as
it
was
reported.
From
here
Cyros
marched
through
Syria
one
stage,
5
leagues,
to
Myriandros,
a
city
inhabited
by
Phoenicians
beside
the
sea:
the
place
was
a
port
of
trade,
and
a
great
many
merchant
ships
were
anchored
there.
In
this
place
he
stayed
seven
days.
Here
Xenias
the
Arcadian
and
Pasion
the
Megarian
put
their
valuables
aboard
a
ship
and
sailed
off;
being
offended,
as
most
people
thought,
because
Cyros
al
lowed
Clearchos
to
keep
the
men
who
had
deserted
to
Clearchos,
when
they
meant
to
go
back
to
Hellas
and
not
against
the
king.
When
these
two
could
not
be
found,
word
went
about
that
Cyros
was
in
pursuit
with
warships;
some
hoped
the
cowards
would
be
caught,
others
pitied
them
if
they
should
be
caught.
But
Cyros
called
a
meeting
of
the
captains
and
said:
“Xenias
and
Pasion
have
left
us.
But
be
sure
they
have
not
deserted:
I
know
where
they
have
gone.
Nor
have
they
escaped:
I
have
galleys
to
catch
their
boat.
But
by
God
I
will
not
pursue
them!
No-one
shall
say
that
I
use
a
man
while
he
is
with
me,
but
if
he
wants
to
go
I
catch
him
and
maltreat
him
and
rob
him
of
his
goods.
Let
them
go,
and
remember
that
they
treat
us
worse
than
we
treat
them.
Indeed
I
have
their
wives
and
children
still,
guarded
in
Tralles
;
but
they
shall
not
lose
them.
They
shall
have
them
again
in
return
for
their
good
service
so
far.”
That
was
what
he
said.
And
when
the
Hellenes
heard
the
fine
spirit
of
Cyros,
if
anyone
was
rather
discouraged
about
the
enterprise,
they
went
on
more
happily
and
more
willingly.
After
this,
Cyros
marched
four
stages,
20
leagues,
to
the
River
Chalos,
roo
feet
wide,
which
was
full
of
lye
tame
fish,
which
the
Syrians,
revering
as
gods,
would
not
let
anyone
hurt—or
the
pigeons
either.
The
villages
where
they
encamped
belonged
to
Parysatis,
given
for
the
queen’s
girdle.
like
others,
given
her
for
such
excuses
as
perquisites
Thence
he
marched
five
stages,
30
leagues,
to
the
source
of
the
River
Dardas,
breadth
100
feet.
There
was
the
palace
of
Belesys,
the
ruler
of
Syria,
and
a
park
large
and
beautiful,
which
contains
all
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth,
But
Cyros
cut
down
the
trees
and
burnt
the
palace.
From
there,
three
stages,
15
leagues,
to
the
Euphrates,
half
a
mile
in
width;
and
a
large
prosperous
town
was
there
named
Thapsacos,
where
he
stayed
five
days.
Then
Cyros
assembled
the
Hellenic
captains,
and
told
them
their
road
was
to
the
Great
King
at
Babylon;
they
were
to
inform
the
men
and
persuade
them
to
follow.
So
they
called
a
public
meeting
and
informed
them.
The
men
were
angry
with
their
captains,
and
said
they
had
known
this
all
along
and
hidden
it
from
them;
said
they
would
not
march,
unless
they
were
paid
as
the
former
expedition
had
been
which
had
marched
up
country
with
Cyros
to
the
father
of
Cyros,
and
then
not
for
battle
but
invited
by
the
father
of
Cyros.
This
the
captains
reported
to
Cyros;
and
he
promised
to
give
each
man
five
minas
of
silver
when
they
reached
Babylon,
and
pay
in
full
until
he
should
bring
the
Hellenes
back
to
Ionia.
Most
of
them
agreed
to
this
offer.
But
Menon
mustered
his
own
detachment
apart,
before
it
was
clear
what
the
other
captains
would
do,
and
said
to
them:
“Men,
listen
to
me.
You
will
be
able
to
win
credit
with
Cyros
above
the
others,
without
danger
and
without
trouble.
Then
what
do
I
advise
you
to
do?
Now
Cyros
asks
the
Hellenes
to
follow
him
against
the
king:
I
say
you
ought
to
cross
the
Euphrates
before
it
is
clear
what
the
others
will
answer.
If
they
vote
to
follow,
you
will
be
thought
to
be
the
cause,
by
crossing
first;
Cyros
will
think
you
the
most
ready
and
willing,
and
he
will
thank
you
and
prove
his
gratitude—he
knows
how
to
do
that
better
than
anyone.
If
they
vote
against,
we
shall
all
go
back
together,
but
you
he
will
trust
most
as
the
only
ones
ready
to
obey,
and
he
will
put
you
in
charge
of
garrisons
or
other
commands;
whatever
else
you
may
want,
I
know
you
will
find
Cyros
a
friend.”
When
they
heard
this,
they
complied,
and
went
across
before
the
others
made
any
answer.
Cyros
was
delighted
when
he
heard
they
had
crossed,
and
sent
Glûs
to
tell
them
so:
he
said:
“I
am
pleased
with
you
now,
men,
and
I
will
take
care
you
shall
be
pleased
with
me,
or
my
name
is
no
longer
Cyros!”
The
soldiers
were
in
high
hopes,
and
prayed
good
fortune
for
him;
it
was
said
also
that
he
sent
magnificent
gifts
for
Menon.
Menon
figures
in
Plato
as
fond
of
money,
and
“the
spoilt
child
of
fortune."
Then
Cyros
crossed,
and
the
whole
army
followed
In
the
crossing,
no-one
was
wetted
above
the
breast.
The
people
of
Thapsacos
said
that
this
river
had
never
been
fordable
for
foot
soldiers
before
that;
it
could
be
crossed
only
by
boats,
and
Abrocomas
had
burnt
them
all
on
his
way
past,
that
Cyros
might
not
cross.
This
was
believed
to
be
a
sign
from
heaven,
and
the
river
had
plainly
made
way
for
Cyros
as
destined
to
be
king.
From
that
place
he
marched
through
Syria
nine
stages
50
leagues,
as
far
as
the
River
Araxes.
Many
villages
were
there,
full
of
corn
and
wine;
there
they
stayed
three
days
and
got
provisions.
”
1.5
Thence
he
marched
through
Arabia,
keeping
the
Euphrates
on
the
right,
five
stages
of
desert,
35
leagues.
In
this
part
the
country
was
one
great
flat
plain
like
a
sea,
but
covered
with
absinth;
whatever
there
was
besides
of
wood
or
reeds,
all
were
sweet-smelling
like
spices.
There
was
no
tree,
but
all
sorts
of
animals,
troops
of
wild
asses,
plenty
of
ostriches,
bustards
also
and
gazelles;
and
the
horsemen
often
chased
these.
The
asses,
if
they
were
chased,
ran
ahead
and
stood
still,
for
they
ran
much
faster
than
fares
again
when
the
horses
came
near
they
ran
as
before,
and
they
could
not
be
caught
unless
the
horsemen
placed
themselves
at
intervals
and
hunted
in
relays.
The
meat
of
those
caught
was
like
venison
but
more
tender.
No-one
caught
an
ostrich;
horsemen
in
chase
soon
gave
up,
for
she
got
far
away
before
them,
running
on
her
feet
and
flying
too,
using
her
wings
like
a
sail.
Bustards,
however,
can
be
caught
if
you
put
them
up
smartly,
for
they
fly
in
short
spurts
like
a
partridge
and
quickly
tire.
Their
flesh
was
very
good.
Marching
through
this
country
they
came
to
the
River
Mascas,
width
100
feet.
There
was
a
great
deserted
city
named
Corsote;
this
was
surrounded
by
the
Mascas,
and
there
they
stayed
three
days
and
got
provisions.
From
that
place
he
marched
thirteen
desert
stages,
90
leagues,
keeping
the
Euphrates
on
his
right,
until
he
reached
the
Gates.
In
these
stages
many
of
the
baggage-animals
were
starved
to
death,
for
there
was
neither
grass
nor
any
sort
of
tree,
but
the
whole
country
was
bare:
the
natives
used
to
dig
up
grinding-stones
beside
the
river
and
shape
them,
and
these
they
took
to
Babylon
and
sold
them
there,
and
bought
corn
to
feed
themselves.
Corn
failed
the
army,
and
none
could
be
bought
except
in
the
Lydian
market
which
Cyros
had
in
his
national
camp,
four
shekels
for
a
capith
of
wheat
or
barley:
the
shekel
is
worth
seven
and
a
half
Attic
obols,
and
the
capith
is
two
Attic
quarts.
The
Attic
drachma
contained
six
obols;
so
7.5
obols
is
1.25
drachmas.
The
quart,
or
choinix,
was
a
man’s
daily
allowance
of
corn,
minimum.
So
the
men
had
to
manage
by
eating
meat.
Some
of
the
stages
were
very
long,
when
he
wished
to
get
on
to
water
or
grass.
Once
indeed
when
there
was
a
narrow
way
and
deep
mud,
bad
going
for
the
carriages,
Cyros
took
charge
with
the
noblest
and
richest
of
his
staff,
and
ordered
Glûs
and
Pigres
to
take
some
of
his
nationals
and
get
the
carriages
through.
As
they
seemed
to
be
lazy
about
it,
he
was
angry,
and
told
the
noble
Persians
beside
him
to
lend
a
hand
with
the
wagons.
Then
could
be
seen
something
of
his
discipline.
Each
man
of
them
threw
off
his
purple
robe
where
he
stood,
and
away
they
went
as
one
might
run
a
race!
Down
the
steep
hill
they
went,
in
their
costly
tunics
and
embroidered
breeches,
and
some
with
necklaces
round
their
necks
and
bracelets
on
their
arms;
in
this
garb
they
jumped
straight
into
the
mud,
and
quicker
than
one
could
think
possible
they
got
the
wagons
clear.
Take
it
in
all,
Cyros
showed
himself
to
be
in
earnest
throughout
the
march,
and
wasted
no
time
except
where
he
had
to
sit
still
for
vittling
or
some
other
necessity.
For
he
thought
that
the
quicker
he
came,
the
less
prepared
for
the
fight
would
the
king
be.
And
it
was
easy
to
see
for
any
sensible
man
that
the
king’s
empire
might
be
strong
in
extent
and
population,
but
it
was
weak
by
the
long
distances
between
his
scattered
forces
if
war
were
made
suddenly
with
speed.
On
the
other
side
of
the
Euphrates
in
the
desert
was
a
city
great
and
prosperous
named
Charmande;
from
this
place
the
soldiers
bought
provisions,
and
they
crossed
on
rafts
in
this
way.
They
took
the
skins
which
they
used
to
cover
their
tents
and
stuffed
them
with
hay,
then
folded
and
sewed
them
up
to
keep
the
water
from
the
hay.
On
these
they
crossed,
and
got
their
provisions,
wine
made
from
dates
and
millet
corn,
which
was
commonest
in
that
country.
There
was
some
quarrel
there
between
Menon’s
soldiers
and
those
of
Clearchos,
when
Clearchos
judged
that
one
of
Menon’s
men
was
in
the
wrong
and
flogged
him.
Menon
went
and
told
his
party;
the
men
were
displeased
and
very
angry
with
Clearchos.
On
the
same
day
Clearchos
had
gone
to
the
crossing
place,
and
after
inspecting
the
market
there
he
rode
back
to
his
tent
with
a
few
followers
through
Menon’s
camp.
Cyros
had
not
yet
come,
but
he
was
on
the
way.
One
of
Menon’s
men
splitting
wood
saw
Clearchos
riding
past,
and
threw
the
axe
at
him.
This
man
missed
him,
but
another
threw
a
stone,
and
another,
then
many
with
shouts
and
cries.
Clearchos
got
away
into
his
own
camp,
and
at
once
called
them
to
arms;
he
told
his
own
men
to
lean
their
shields
against
their
knees,
ready
to
receive
cavalry
and
himself
with
the
Thracians
and
horsemen
he
had
in
the
camp,
more
than
forty
but
mostly
Thracians,
he
rode
for
Menon’s
division.
These
were
astounded
and
so
was
Menon,
and
all
ran
for
their
arms,
some
standing
still
on
the
spot
in
dismay.
Proxenos
happened
to
come
in
behind
them
with
a
company
of
his
men-at-arms,
and
he
went
straight
in
between
them
and
grounded
arms,
and
begged
Clearchos
to
desist.
But
Clearchos
was
angry
to
hear
his
danger
lightly
spoken
of
when
he
had
hardly
escaped
being
stoned
to
death,
and
told
him
to
get
out
of
the
way.
At
this
moment
Cyros
came
up
and
asked
what
the
matter
was.
At
once
he
took
his
javelin
in
hand
and
galloped
in
with
those
of
his
bodyguard
that
he
had
with
him
and
said:
“Now
then,
Clearchos
and
Proxenos
amd
you
others,
you
don’t
know
what
you
are
doing.
If
you
make
a
fight
among
yourselves,
understand
that
you
will
cut
me
to
pieces
this
very
day,
and
yourselves
very
soon
after
me!
For
if
anything
goes
wrong
with
us,
these
people
you
see
round
us
here
will
all
be
worse
enemies
to
us
than
the
king’s
army.”
Clearchos
came
to
himself
when
he
heard
this;
both
parties
desisted,
and
went
back
quietly
to
their
own
quarters.
1.6
As
they
moved
onwards
from
this
place
tracks
of
horses
appeared,
and
dung;
there
seemed
to
be
traces
of
something
like
two
thousand
horses.
They
were
going
in
front
and
burning
the
grass
and
anything
else
that
was
useful.
Orontas,
a
Persian
who
was
there,
himself
one
of
the
royal
family,
and
said
to
be
one
of
the
best
men
in
Persia
in
military
matters,
made
a
treacherous
proposal.
He
had
form-
erly
been
at
war
with
Cyros
but
made
it
up;
now
he
told
Cyros
that
if
he
would
give
him
a
thousand
horsemen,
he
would
either
lie
in
wait
for
this
incinerating
vanguard
and
kill
the
lot,
or
else
bring
in
a
good
many
and
stop
their
incinerating,
and
he
would
take
care
that
they
should
never
be
able
to
see
Cyros’s
army
and
take
the
news
to
the
king.
Cyros
thought
this
sounded
like
useful
advice,
and
he
told
him
to
take
a
part
from
each
of
the
commanders.
So
Orontas
thought
the
horsemen
were
there
ready
for
him,
and
wrote
a
letter
to
the
king
that
he
would
come
and
bring
with
him
as
many
horsemen
as
possible;
he
must
warn
his
own
cavalry
to
receive
him
as
a
friend.
In
the
letter
were
also
reminders
of
their
former
friendship
and
trust.
This
letter
he
gave
to
a
trusty
man,
as
he
thought;
but
the
man
took
it
and
gave
it
to
Cyros.
Cyros
read
it,
and
arrested
Orontas,
and
summoned
to
his
own
tent
seven
of
the
noblest
men
about
him,
and
directed
the
Hellenic
captains
to
bring
armed
men
and
post
them
around
his
tent.
They
did
so,
and
brought
some
three
thousand
menat-arms.
He
invited
Clearchos
in
to
be
one
of
the
court,
for
he
thought
him
to
be
the
leading
man
among
all
the
Hellenes,
and
this
was
the
public
opinion
too.
Afterwards
he
told
his
friends
how
Cyros
conducted
the
courtmartial;
for
it
was
no
secret.
Cyros
began
in
this
way:
“I
have
summoned
you,
my
friends,
that
I
may
consult
you
what
is
right
to
do
before
God
and
man,
and
so
I
may
do
about
Orontas,
who
is
here.
This
man
was
first
given
me
by
my
father
to
be
my
subject.
Then
under
orders,
as
he
said
himself,
from
my
brother,
he
made
war
against
me
when
he
held
the
fortress
of
Sardis;
and
I
took
up
the
challenge
and
made
him
decide
to
cease
war
against
me,
and
we
clasped
hands,
and
after
that,
is
there
any
wrong
I
have
done
you,
Orontas?”
He
said
“No.”
Again
Cyros
asked.
“Then
I
did
you
no
wrong
after
that,
as
you
admit
yourself,
but
did
you
desert
to
the
Mysians
and
damage
my
country
as
much
as
you
could?”
Orontas
said
“Yes.”
“Very
well,”
said
Cyros;
“when
you
found
out
your
own
weakness,
did
you
take
refuge
at
the
altar
of
Artemis,
and
say
you
were
sorry,
and
did
I
believe
you,
and
did
we
both
pledge
loyalty
and
friendship
together?”
This
also
Orontas
acknowledged.
“Then
what
wrong
have
I
done
you
now,”
said
Cyros,
“that
for
the
third
time
you
have
been
discovered
planning
treachery
against
me?”
Orontas
said
that
he
had
suffered
no
wrong,
and
Cyros
asked:
“Do
you
admit,
then,
that
you
have
done
wrong
to
me?”
“I
can’t
help
it,”
said
Orontas.
Then
Cyros
asked
again:
“And
could
you
ever
become
an
enemy
to
my
brother
again,
and
a
faithful
friend
to
me?”
He
answered,
“Even
if
I
should,
Cyros,
you
would
never
believe
it.”
Then
Cyros
turned
to
the
court
and
said,
“That
is
what
the
man
has
done,
you
hear
what
he
says.
You
speak
first,
Clearchos;
what
is
your
judgment?”
Clearchos
said,
“My
advice
is
to
get
rid
of
this
man
at
once,
that
we
need
not
be
obliged
to
watch
him,
but
we
may
have
leisure
from
him
to
do
our
best
for
these
willing
helpers.”
He
said
the
others
agreed
with
this
judgment.
After
this,
he
said,
at
the
bidding
of
Cyros,
all
those
present,
including
the
man’s
kinsmen,
rose
and
took
hold
of
the
girdle
of
Orontas
as
a
sign
that
he
must
die;
then
he
was
led
away
by
those
whose
duty
it
was.
But
those
who
did
reverence
to
him
before,
did
reverence
then,
when
they
saw
him,
although
they
knew
he
was
being
led
away
to
death.
He
was
taken
into
the
tent
of
Artapates,
the
most
trusty
of
all
Cyros’s
wandbearers,
but
after
that
no-one
ever
saw
Orontas
alive
or
dead,
and
no-one
who
knew
ever
told
how
he
died.
People
guessed
all
sorts
of
things,
but
no
tomb
of
Orontas
was
ever
seen.
1.7
From
that
place
he
marched
through
Babylonia
three
stages,
12
leagues.
In
the
third
stage
Cyros
held
a
review
of
Hellenes
and
national
troops
on
the
plain
at
midnight,
for
he
thought
the
king
would
be
there
at
the
coming
dawn
with
his
army,
to
fight.
He
ordered
Clearchos
to
lead
the
right
wing,
and
Menon
the
Thessalian
the
left,
and
he
arranged
his
own
troops
himself.
After
the
review,
with
the
daylight
deserters
came
in
from
the
Great
King,
and
reported
to
Cyros
about
the
king’s
army.
Cyros
invited
the
captains
and
other
officers
of
the
Hellenes,
and
held
council
how
he
should
arrange
the
battle,
and
offered
this
cheering
advice.
“Gentlemen,”
he
said,
“not
for
want
of
men
have
I
brought
you
here
as
my
allies,
but
I
believe
you
to
be
better
and
stronger
than
large
numbers
of
my
own
countrymen,
and
that
is
why
I
did
it.
Show
yourselves
men,
therefore,
worthy
of
the
freedom
which
you
possess
and
which
I
envy.
Be
sure
I
would
give
all
I
have
and
many
times
over
if
I
could
get
that
freedom.
But
I
understand
what
a
contest
you
have
before
you,
and
I
will
tell
you,
that
you
may
understand
also.
The
numbers
are
enormous,
and
they
will
come
on
with
loud
shouts
and
cries;
but
if
you
can
stand
that,
I
am
ashamed
to
think
what
kind
of
men
you
will
find
in
this
country.
If
you
show
yourselves
men,
and
if
all
goes
well
with
my
part,
I
will
arrange
that
any
one
of
you
who
wishes
to
return
home
will
be
the
envy
of
those
he
meets
at
home;
but
I
think
I
shall
persuade
many
of
you
to
choose
what
I
have
here
rather
than
what
he
will
find
at
home.”
Then
Gaulites,
a
Samian
exile
who
was
present,
and
a
true
friend
of
Cyros,
said,
“Oh
yes,
Cyros,
but
some
do
say
that
you
can
promise
great
things
now,
because
all
this
danger
is
threatening,
but
you
will
not
remember
if
all
goes
well,
so
they
say;
some
say
that
even
if
you
do
remember,
with
the
best
of
will
you
cannot
pay
all
you
promise.”
Cyros
listened,
and
said,
“Well,
gentlemen,
my
father’s
empire
reaches
southwards
as
far
as
where
it
is
too
hot
for
men
to
live,
and
northwards
to
where
it
is
too
cold;
all
between
is
under
the
governance
of
my
brother’s
friends.
If
we
are
victorious,
I
must
make
my
friends
masters
of
all
this.
So
I
have
no
fear
that
I
may
not
have
something
to
give
to
each
of
my
friends;
what
I
fear
is
that
there
may
not
be
friends
enough.
And
to
each
of
you
Hellenes
I
will
give
a
golden
crown.”
On
hearing
this
they
were
much
more
cheerful
and
eager
themselves,
and
they
reported
it
to
the
others.
Besides
the
Hellenic
captains,
many
others
paid
Cyros
a
visit,
asking
what
they
would
get
if
they
won,
and
he
sent
them
all
away
satisfied.
All
that
spoke
with
him
begged
him
not
to
expose
himself
in
the
battle,
but
to
take
post
behind
themselves.
At
this
crisis
Clearchos
asked
him
once,
“Do
you
really
think
he'll
fight
with
you,
Cyros,
your
own
brother?”
“I’m
sure
he
will,”
said
Cyros,
“if
he
is
really
the
son
of
Dareios
and
Parysatis,
if
he
really
is
my
brother—not
without
a
battle
shall
I
win
this
prize.”
At
the
review
the
numbers
were:
Hellenes,
shields
10,400,
targeteers
2,500;
national
troops
with
Cyros,
100,000,
and
scythe-bearing
chariots
about
20.
The
enemy
were
said
to
be
1,200,000,
with
200
scythe-bearing
chariots.
There
were
6,000
cavalry
besides,
under
Artagerses;
these
again
were
posted
before
the
king
himself.
The
royal
army
was
commanded
by
four
marshals
or
generals,
each
having
300,000
men
under
him—Abrocomas,
Tissaphernes,
Gobryas,
Arbaces.
But
of
these
not
all
were
present
in
the
battle,
only
900,000
men
and
150
scythe-bearing
chariots;
for
Abrocomas
came
five
days
too
late,
having
to
march
from
Phoenicia.
This
was
what
the
deserter
reported
to
Cyros
before
the
battle,
and
after
the
battle
those
that
were
left
of
the
enemy
said
the
same.
From
this
place
Cyros
marched
one
stage,
3
leagues,
with
the
whole
army
in
array
both
national
and
Hellenic,
for
he
thought
the
king
would
fight
on
that
day.
Half-way
through
that
stage
a
deep
trench
had
been
dug,
five
fathoms
across,
three
fathoms
deep.
The
trench
extended
inland
for
twelve
leagues
over
the
plain
as
far
as
the
wall
of
Media.
(Here
are
the
canals
bringing
water
from
the
River
Tigris;
there
are
four,
100
feet
wide
and
very
deep,
and
barges
of
corn
ply
upon
them;
they
discharge
into
the
Euphrates,
and
are
one
league
apart,
with
bridges
over
them.)
Along
the
Euphrates
was
a
narrow
path,
20
feet
in
width,
between
the
river
and
the
end
of
the
trench.
This
trench
the
Great
King
had
made
for
a
defence
when
he
learnt
that
Cyros
was
coming.
Cyros
and
his
army
now
passed
along
this
path,
and
so
they
came
inside
the
trench.
So
on
this
day
the
king
did
not
fight,
but
there
were
many
tracks
of
men
and
horses
retreating.
Here
Cyros
called
Silanos
the
Ambraciot
seer,
and
paid
him
3,000
darics
for
his
bet,
because
eleven
days
before
he
had
declared
at
the
sacrifice
that
the
king
would
not
fight
within
ten
days,
and
Cyros
said,
“Then
he
won’t
fight
at
all,
if
he
does
not
fight
within
ten
days;
and
if
your
words
come
true,
I
promise
you
ten
talents.”
So
he
paid
him
the
money
then,
because
ten
days
were
past.
But
since
here
at
the
trench
the
king
did
not
try
to
hinder
the
passage
of
Cyros
and
his
army,
both
Cyros
and
the
others
believed
he
had
given
up
the
thought
of
fighting;
so
the
next
day
Cyros
marched
more
carelessly,
and
the
day
after
he
was
leading
the
way
seated
in
his
chariot,
with
a
small
body
of
men
in
front,
while
most
of
the
army
was
in
disorder
and
the
soldiers
had
left
much
of
their
heavy
arms
to
be
carried
by
wagons
or
pack
animals.
1.8
It
was
already
about
full-market
time,
9
or
10
a.m.
and
the
stage
where
they
were
to
rest
was
near,
when
Pategyas,
a
trusty
Persian
from
the
staff
of
Cyros,
suddenly
appeared
galloping
on
a
sweating
horse,
and
shouted
out
straight
to
all
he
met,
in
Greek
and
Persian,
that
the
king
with
a
large
army
was
coming
prepared
for
battle.
Then
there
was
great
confusion.
The
Hellenes
thought,
and
so
did
all,
that
they
would
be
attacked
on
the
spot
in
this
disorder;
and
Cyros
leapt
from
his
car
and
put
on
his
corselet
and
got
on
his
horse
and
took
his
lances
in
hand,
and
sent
word
to
all
the
rest
to
arm
and
take
post
every
man.
At
once
they
fell
in
with
all
haste,
Clearchos
holding
the
right
wing
on
the
Euphrates
River,
Proxenos
next,
and
then
the
others,
with
Menon
commanding
the
left
wing
of
the
Hellenic
forces.
Of
the
national
troops,
1,000
Paphlagonian
horsemen
took
stand
by
Clearchos
on
the
right,
and
the
Hellenic
targeteers;
in
the
left
wing,
Ariaios,
Cyros’s
second-in-command,
and
the
other
nationals;
and
Cyros
with
his
600
cavalry
in
the
centre,
all
except
Cyros
being
armed
with
corselets
and
thigh
pieces
and
helmets,
but
Cyros
went
into
battle
with
bare
head—it
is
said
that
the
Persians
generally
risk
fighting
with
the
head
bare.
All
the
horses
wore
protections
on
forehead
and
breast,
and
the
horsemen
had
Hellenic
swords.
It
was
already
midday,
and
the
enemy
had
not
appeared;
but
when
afternoon
came
dust
appeared
like
a
white
cloud,
and
some
time
afterwards
a
sort
of
blackness
spreading
far
over
the
plain.
But
when
they
came
nearer,
quickly
there
were
flashes
of
bronze
and
spears
and
the
lines
were
visible.
Cavalry
in
white
corselets
were
on
the
enemy’s
left
wing;
Tissaphernes
was
said
to
be
in
command
of
these.
Next
came
wickershieldmen,
next
men-at-arms
with
wooden
shields
which
reached
to
their
feet—these
were
said
to
be
Egyptians;
then
more
cavalry,
bowmen
too.
All
these
were
arranged
by
nations,
each
nation
marching
as
a
solid
square
of
men.
In
front
of
all
were
the
chariots,
with
large
spaces
between,
those
which
are
called
scythe-bearers.
They
had
the
scythes
sticking
out
sideways
from
the
axle-trees
and
under
the
cars
pointing
downwards,
to
cut
through
any
they
met.
The
notion
was
to
drive
at
the
companies
of
Hellenes
and
cut
them
through.
When
Cyros
had
warned
them
not
to
mind
the
shouts
and
cries
of
the
barbarians,
he
made
a
mistake;
there
was
no
shouting,
but
they
came
on
in
deep
silence
quietly
in
step,
and
slowly.
At
this
moment,
Cyros,
riding
past
with
Pigres
the
interpreter
and
three
or
four
others,
shouted
out
to
Clearchos
to
lead
his
lines
against
the
enemy
centre,
because
the
king
was
there:
“If
we
beat
that,”
he
said,
“we
have
won!”
Clearchos
eyed
the
mass
in
the
middle,
and
learnt
from
Cyros
that
the
king
was
outside
in
the
Hellenic
left
(for
the
king
so
much
exceeded
in
numbers
that
with
his
centre
he
overlapped
Cyros’s
left);
he
still
was
unwilling
to
break
away
the
right
wing
from
the
river
for
fear
he
might
be
turned
on
both
flanks,
so
he
answered
Cyros
that
he
would
take
care
that
all
went
well.
At
this
crisis
the
Persian
army
was
advancing
evenly,
but
the
Hellenic
line
was
halted
as
the
men
kept
coming
up
and
forming.
Cyros
was
riding
some
way
off
from
his
army,
and
looking
keenly
at
each
side,
staring
at
the
enemy
and
his
own
men.
An
Athenian,
Xenophon,
saw
him
and
went
out
to
him
from
the
Hellenic
line,
and
asked
if
he
had
any
orders.
Cyros
drew
rein,
and
told
him
to
spread
the
news
everywhere
that
the
omens
from
the
sacrifice
were
all
favourable.
As
he
was
speaking,
he
heard
a
confused
noise
running
through
the
ranks,
and
asked
what
the
noise
was.
The
other
said
that
the
word
of
the
day
was
being
passed
round
for
the
second
time.
Cyros
wondered
who
gave
the
word,
and
what
it
was.
He
answered:
“Zeus
Saviour
and
Victory.”
Cyros
said,
“I
accept
the
omen,
so
be
it!”
As
he
spoke
he
rode
away
to
his
own
place.
The
two
lines
were
hardly
six
or
seven
hundred
yards
apart
when
the
Hellenes
began
to
chant
the
battle
hymn
and
moved
against
the
enemy.
Part
of
the
line
billowed
out
as
they
moved,
and
the
slower
part
began
to
double
up;
then
all
together
broke
into
a
ringing
cheer,
“Eleleu,
eleleu!”
and
all
charged
at
the
double.
Some
say
they
also
beat
the
spears
on
the
shields
to
scare
the
horses.
Before
one
shot
reached
them,
the
barbarians
turned
and
fled.
At
once
the
Hellenes
pursued
with
might
and
main,
but
shouted
to
each
other,
“Don’t
run
races!
Keep
your
line!”
The
chariots
ran
away
without
drivers,
some
through
their
own
people,
some
through
the
Hellenes:
these
saw
them
coming,
and
gave
them
room.
One
man
was
caught
as
he
stood
like
someone
dazed
in
the
middle
of
a
racecourse;
even
this
fellow
had
no
hurt,
so
they
said,
and
not
one
other
Hellene
was
hurt
in
this
battle,
except
one
on
the
left
wing,
said
to
have
been
shot
by
an
arrow.
Cyros
was
delighted
when
he
saw
the
Hellenes
victorious
in
their
part
and
pursuing;
he
was
greeted
as
king
already
by
those
about
him,
but
even
so
he
was
not
induced
to
join
the
pursuit.
He
kept
his
own
body
of
600
horse
in
close
order,
and
watched
to
see
what
the
king
would
do.
He
knew
of
course
that
the
king
held
the
centre
of
the
Persian
army.
Indeed
all
the
generals
of
these
barbarian
nations
hold
the
centre
when
they
command;
they
consider
it
to
be
safest
when
their
force
is
on
both
sides,
and
if
they
need
to
send
dispatches,
the
army
knows
in
half
the
time.
So
the
king
was
then
holding
the
centre
of
his
army,
and
still
overlapping
the
left
wing
of
Cyros.
Since
there
was
no
enemy
in
front,
and
none
against
the
troops
drawn
up
before
him,
he
wheeled
round
to
encircle
Cyros.
Then
Cyros,
fearing
he
might
get
behind
and
cut
up
the
Hellenic
force,
charged
at
him;
with
his
600
he
fell
on
the
troops
posted
in
front
of
the
king,
and
put
the
6,000
men
to
flight,
and
it
is
said
killed
with
his
own
hand
their
commander
Artagerses.
When
those
were
routed,
Cyros’s
600
were
broken
up
in
the
pursuit,
except
a
very
few
left
about
him,
hardly
more
than
his
table-companions,
as
they
were
called,
Left
with
these,
he
caught
sight
of
the
king
and
the
bodyguard
round
him;
then
he
could
hold
himself
no
longer,
but
charged
at
him,
saying,
“I
see
the
man!”
and
struck
him
on
the
breast
and
wounded
him
through
his
corselet,
as
the
doctor
Ctesias
reports,
who
says
he
cured
the
wound.
As
he
struck,
someone
struck
Cyros
with
a
lance
violently
under
the
eye;
and
there
as
they
fought,
the
king
and
Cyros
and
the
others
about
each,
how
many
fell
of
the
king’s
party
Ctesias
tells,
for
he
was
in
attendance;
and
Cyros
himself
was
killed,
and
eight
of
the
most
noble
about
him
lay
dead
over
his
body.
It
is
said
that
Artapates,
who
was
the
most
trusted
of
all
his
wandholders,
when
he
saw
Cyros
fallen
leaped
off
his
horse
and
threw
himself
on
the
body.
Some
say
the
king
told
a
man
to
cut
his
throat
over
the
body,
some
that
he
killed
himself
with
his
own
scimitar—he
had
a
golden
scimitar,
and
he
wore
bracelets
and
armlets
and
the
other
ornaments
of
the
noblest
Persians;
for
he
was
highly
honoured
by
Cyros
for
loyalty
and
trustworthiness.
1.9
So
died
Cyros;
of
all
Persians
that
came
after
the
first
Cyros,
the
most
royal
and
most
worthy
to
be
king,
as
all
agree
who
are
reputed
to
have
known
Cyros
themselves.
To
begin
with,
when
he
was
still
a
boy,
and
being
educated
along
with
his
brother
and
the
other
boys,
he
was
considered
best
of
them
all
in
everything.
For
all
the
sons
of
the
noblest
Persians
are
educated
at
the
king’s
door;
there
one
may
learn
many
a
lesson
in
good
manners,
but
nothing
ugly
can
be
heard
or
seen
there.
They
see
and
hear
when
honour
is
done
to
any
by
the
king,
and
when
others
are
disgraced;
so
from
boyhood
they
learn
both
to
rule
and
to
be
ruled.
There
Cyros
was
thought
to
be
the
most
modest
of
all
his
agemates,
obeying
his
elders
better
than
his
own
inferiors
did.
Next,
he
was
the
greatest
lover
of
horses,
and
knew
best
how
to
manage
them;
and
in
war-like
accomplishments,
in
archery
and
casting
the
javelin,
they
judged
him
the
most
eager
to
learn
and
the
most
careful
to
practise.
Again
when
he
was
old
enough,
he
was
most
fond
of
hunting,
ay
and
most
ready
to
face
danger
among
wild
beasts.
When
a
bear
charged
him
once
he
did
not
shrink,
but
grappled
with
her;
he
was
dragged
off
his
horse,
and
received
wounds
which
left
their
scars
on
him,
but
killed
her
at
last;
and
he
richly
rewarded
the
first
man
who
came
to
help.
Then
he
was
sent
down
country
as
governor
of
Lydia
and
great
Phrygia
and
Cappadocia,
and
appointed
commander-in-chief
of
all
the
forces
which
had
to
assemble
in
the
plain
of
Castolos.
In
this
the
first
thing
he
made
clear
was,
that
if
ever
he
made
a
truce
or
bargain
or
promise
he
never
broke
it.
Indeed
the
cities
put
into
his
care
all
trusted
him,
and
the
men
trusted
him;
and
if
anyone
was
an
enemy,
truce
once
made
he
trusted
that
nothing
would
be
done
to
him
contrary
to
that
truce.
Accordingly
when
he
made
war
against
Tissaphernes,
all
the
cities
willingly
chose
Cyros
instead
of
Tissaphernes,
except
Miletos;
and
there
the
people
feared
him
because
he
would
not
abandon
their
banished
men.
For
he
said,
and
he
proved
by
his
acts,
that
he
never
would
abandon
them
when
once
he
had
become
their
friend,
not
even
if
they
lost
numbers
and
lost
luck.
If
anyone
did
either
evil
or
good
to
him,
he
tried
to
outdo
them,
and
made
that
quite
clear.
Some
said
that
his
common
prayer
was,
“May
I
live
as
long
as
I
can
go
one
better
with
friends
and
foes!”
Indeed
there
was
no
man
alive
in
our
time
who
found
so
many
others
eager
to
grant
him
money
and
city
and
even
their
own
bodies.
To
be
sure,
no-one
could
say
that
he
allowed
any
to
do
harm
or
wrong
and
then
laugh
in
his
face;
he
punished
quite
without
mercy,
and
you
could
often
see
by
the
highroads
persons
lacking
feet
or
hands
or
eyes.
The
result
was
that
in
Cyros’s
province
a
man
might
travel
fearlessly
where
he
would,
whether
Hellene
or
Asiatic,
and
carry
whatever
suited
him,
so
long
as
he
did
no
wrong.
Moreover,
those
who
were
good
men
in
war
he
rewarded
notably,
as
all
agreed.
For
example,
he
had
a
war
against
the
Pisidians
and
Mysians.
He
took
the
field
himself
against
these
countries;
and
when
he
saw
men
ready
to
take
risks,
he
made
these
governors
of
the
places
he
conquered,
and
rewarded
them
besides,
and
so
these
were
seen
to
prosper
exceedingly,
and
the
cowards
were
thought
fit
to
be
their
slaves.
Therefore
he
found
plenty
of
volunteers
in
any
risk,
when
they
thought
Cyros
would
see.
In
justice
and
honesty,
if
anyone
showed
himself
glad
to
display
these
virtues,
he
took
good
care
to
make
these
richer
than
those
who
were
greedy
for
unjust
advantage.
All
his
dealings
were
just,
indeed,
but
he
was
especially
particular
to
have
a
real
army.
Thus
the
captains
and
officers
from
abroad
who
served
him
for
pay
understood
that
to
serve
Cyros
well
was
worth
more
to
them
than
so
much
a
month:
besides
this,
if
anyone
did
serve
him
well,
he
never
left
willing
service
unrewarded.
Accordingly
Cyros
always
found,
as
they
said,
the
best
men
to
carry
out
any
enterprise.
If
he
saw
one
a
skilful
and
just
administrator,
who
managed
his
district
well
and
collected
the
revenues,
he
never
deprived
him
but
always
added
to
his
trust;
so
men
worked
willingly,
and
got
wealth
boldly,
and
never
tried
to
hide
from
Cyros
what
they
got:
he
showed
himself
not
one
to
envy
those
who
were
openly
rich,
but
hidden
riches
he
tried
to
bring
into
use.
Friends
again,
if
he
made
any
and
found
them
loyal,
and
judged
them
capable
assistants
in
what
he
wanted
to
do,
he
treated
well,
no
man
better,
as
all
agree.
For
just
as
he
wanted
friends
to
help
in
each
undertaking,
so
he
tried
his
best
to
help
these
friends
in
anything
which
he
saw
they
wanted.
More
gifts
were
offered
to
him,
I
believe,
than
to
any
other
man
who
ever
lived,
for
many
reasons;
and
no-one
was
ever
more
ready
to
distribute
these
among
his
friends,
while
he
considered
their
tastes
to
see
what
each
wanted
most.
When
the
gifts
were
meant
for
his
person,
whether
in
battle
or
just
as
finery,
he
used
to
say,
“I
can’t
deck
out
my
body
in
all
this
finery,
but
a
man’s
best
finery
is
when
his
friends
go
fine.”
In
great
things
it
is
no
wonder
he
could
outdo
his
generous
friends,
since
he
had
greater
power;
but
he
took
care
to
have
the
better
of
them
in
little
attentions
and
graces,
which
appears
to
me
more
admirable
still,
When
he
received
some
specially
good
wine,
he
would
often
send
a
keg
half
full
to
a
friend,
with
a
message,
“I
haven't
drunk
such
good
wine
for
a
long
time,
so
I
send
you
this.
Please
drink
it
up
to-day
with
your
best
friends!”
Often
he
would
send
half
a
goose
or
half
a
cake,
and
things
like
that,
telling
his
bearer
to
say,
“Cyros
liked
this,
and
he
wants
you
to
have
a
taste.”
When
hay
was
hard
to
get
and
he
had
plenty
himself
because
he
had
provided
it,
and
there
were
many
servants,
he
would
send
round
to
tell
his
friends
to
stuff
the
horses
they
rode
with
this,
that
they
might
not
starve
while
they
carried
his
friends
about.
If
he
ever
went
on
progress
and
crowds
came
to
see
him,
he
would
call
up
friends
and
talk
seriously
to
them,
to
show
whom
he
valued.
So
from
all
I
hear,
I
judge
that
no-one
has
ever
been
better
loved
by
Hellenes
and
Asiatics
alike.
Here
is
another
proof,
When
Cyros
was
the
king's
slave,
no-one
ever
left
him
for
the
king,
only
Orontas
tried,
and
indeed
the
king
himself
found
that
the
man
he
thought
faithful
to
himself
was
a
better
friend
to
Cyros;
but
from
the
king,
many
did
come
away
to
Cyros
after
they
became
enemies,
and
those
moreover
whom
the
king
cared
for
most—they
thought
that
with
Cyros
if
they
played
their
parts
well
they
would
receive
a
worthier
return
than
with
the
king.
A
great
proof
again
is
what
happened
at
the
end
of
his
life,
to
show
that
he
was
noble
himself,
and
knew
how
to
judge
rightly
the
trusty
and
loyal
and
firm;
for
when
he
died
all
his
friends
and
table
companions
died
fighting
over
him,
except
Ariaios,
who
was
posted
on
the
left
wing,
as
it
happened,
in
command
of
the
cavalry,
and
when
he
perceived
that
Cyros
was
dead
he
escaped
with
all
his
command.
1.10
Then
the
head
and
right
hand
of
Cyros
were
cut
off.
The
king,
pursuing,
fell
on
Cyros’s
camp;
those
with
Ariaios
did
not
stand,
but
escaped
through
their
own
camp
to
the
stage-house
where
they
had
come
from;
the
distance
was
said
to
be
four
leagues.
The
king
and
his
troops
plundered
the
camp,
and
took
a
great
spoil,
including
the
Phocaian
mistress
of
Cyros,
famous
as
“the
clever
and
beautiful.”
The
Milesian,
who
was
younger,
was
caught
by
the
king’s
men,
but
she
slipt
out
of
her
robe,
and
escaped
to
a
body
of
Hellenes
who
happened
to
be
on
guard
among
the
baggage
animals.
They
resisted
the
plunderers
and
killed
many
of
them,
and
of
themselves
some
were
killed,
too,
yet
they
did
not
take
flight,
but
they
saved
the
woman
and
everything
else
that
was
in
their
charge,
goods
and
men.
At
this
time
the
king
and
the
Hellenes
were
three
or
four
miles
apart,
the
Hellenes
pursuing
and
believing
they
were
victorious
everywhere,
the
others
plundering
and
believing
they
were
victorious
themselves.
But
when
the
Hellenes
perceived
that
the
king
and
his
army
were
in
their
camp,
and
when
the
king
heard
from
Tissaphernes
that
the
Hellenes
were
victors
on
their
part
and
far
away
in
pursuit,
at
once
the
king
collected
his
forces
and
put
them
in
order.
Clearchos
called
Proxenos,
who
was
nearest,
and
consulted
him
whether
they
should
send
a
party
or
all
go
back
to
defend
the
camp.
Meanwhile
the
king
showed
himself
advancing
from
the
rear,
as
it
seemed.
The
Hellenes
turned
and
prepared
to
receive
his
attack
on
the
spot,
but
the
king
did
not
approach
them;
he
passed
them
by
the
way
he
had
come,
outside
what
had
been
their
left
wing,
catching
up
those
who
had
deserted
to
the
Hellenes
in
the
battle,
and
also
Tissaphernes
with
his
division.
For
Tissaphernes
when
they
first
met
had
not
taken
flight,
but
he
rode
along
the
river
through
the
Hel-
lenic
targeteers;
he
killed
none
in
passing
through,
but
the
Hellenes
made
room
and
struck
at
them
and
volleyed
as
they
went.
Episthenes
of
Amphipolis
was
in
command,
said
to
be
a
capable
officer.
Tissaphernes
then
got
rather
the
worst
of
it
but
came
out
clear;
he
did
not
turn
back,
but
went
as
far
as
to
the
Hellenic
camp,
and
there
found
the
king,
when
they
put
their
forces
together
again
and
went
on.
When
they
came
to
the
Hellenic
left
wing
the
Hellenes
were
afraid
they
might
attack
and
surround
them
and
cut
them
to
pieces,
and
they
decided
to
extend
their
line
and
put
the
river
behind
them.
While
they
were
discussing
this,
lo
and
behold
the
king
passed
them,
and
placed
his
line
opposite
them
in
the
same
position
as
he
was
in
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle.
When
the
Hellenes
saw
them
near,
and
drawn
up
opposite,
they
chanted
the
battle-hymn
again
and
charged
much
more
vigorously
than
before.
Again
the
barbarians
would
not
stand,
but
ran
even
sooner
than
before.
The
Hellenes
pursued
them
as
far
as
some
village,
and
there
they
halted;
for
above
the
village
was
a
mound,
on
which
the
king’s
party
rallied,
only
cavalry
now,
but
they
covered
the
mound
so
that
no-one
could
see
what
happened.
But
they
said
they
did
see
the
royal
standard,
a
golden
eagle,
stretched
across
a
shield
and
held
up
on
a
pole.
As
soon
as
the
Hellenes
moved
again
the
horsemen
at
once
left
the
mound,
not
all
together
but
in
small
parties;
the
mound
became
bare
by
degrees,
and
at
last
they
were
all
gone.
Clearchos
did
not
take
his
army
upon
the
mound,
but
halted
them
at
the
foot,
and
sent
up
Lycios
the
Syracusan
and
one
other
to
report
what
there
was
on
the
other
side.
Lycios
rode
up,
and
reported
that
they
were
all
going
as
fast
as
they
could.
Just
then
the
sun
set,
the
Hellenes
halted
and
ordered
arms,
and
rested,
wondering
why
Cyros
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
no
messages
came
from
him;
for
they
did
not
know
he
was
dead,
but
they
supposed
he
was
in
pursuit,
or
gone
forward
to
occupy
some
place.
They
deliberated
whether
they
should
stay
there
and
bring
up
the
baggage,
or
go
back
to
camp.
They
decided
to
go
back,
and
they
reached
the
tents
about
supper-time.
This
was
the
end
of
that
day.
They
found
most
of
their
goods
plundered,
and
all
the
food
and
drink
gone;
even
the
wagons
loaded
with
barley
and
wine
which
Cyros
had
provided
to
distribute
if
the
army
were
in
special
need
(400
wagons,
it
was
said),
even
these
the
king’s
army
had
spoiled.
So
most
of
the
Hellenes
had
no
dinner,
and
they
had
not
had
breakfast
either;
for
the
king
appeared
before
the
army
was
dismissed
for
breakfast.
So
they
passed
that
night.
BOOK
TWO
2.1
At
daybreak
the
captains
met.
They
were
surprised
that
Cyros
had
neither
appeared
himself,
nor
sent
someone
to
tell
them
what
to
do.
They
decided,
therefore,
to
collect
what
they
had,
and
to
get
under
arms,
and
to
go
on
till
they
found
him.
As
they
were
just
starting,
at
sunrise,
up
came
Procles,
the
governor
of
Teuthrania,
a
man
descended
from
Damaratos
the
Laconian,
a
Spartan
king
deposed,
who
had
settled
in
Mysia
and
with
him
Glûs,
the
son
of
Taméds.
These
told
them
that
Cyros
was
dead,
but
Ariaios
had
escaped,
and
was
with
the
other
Asiatics
in
the
stagehouse
from
which
they
marched
on
the
day
before;
he
said
he
would
wait
that
day
for
them,
if
they
would
come,
but
on
the
morrow
he
was
going
back
to
Ionia,
where
he
came
from.
When
they
heard
this
the
captains
were
very
much
distressed,
and
so
were
the
other
Hellenes.
Clearchos
said,
“If
only
Cyros
were
alive!
But
pray
report
to
Ariaios,
that
we
are
victorious
over
the
king,
and,
as
you
see,
no-one
is
left
here
to
fight
us;
if
you
had
not
come,
we
should
be
on
the
march
against
the
king
now.
We
say
to
Ariaios
that
if
he
will
come
here,
we
will
place
him
on
the
royal
throne;
for
the
kingdom
belongs
to
the
conquerors.”
With
these
words
he
sent
the
messengers
away,
and
with
them
Cheirisophos
the
Laconian
and
Menon
the
Thessalian;
Menon
himself
wished
it,
for
he
was
a
guest-friend
of
Ariaios.
So
they
went,
and
Clearchos
remained.
The
army
prepared
food
as
well
as
they
could,
butchering
the
cattle
and
asses
of
the
baggage
train;
they
got
wood
by
going
a
little
in
front
of
their
lines,
where
they
found
plenty
of
arrows
on
the
battlefield,
which
they
had
forced
the
deserters
from
the
king
to
throw
away,
and
the
shields
of
wickerwork
and
Egyptian
wooden
shields.
There
were
plenty
of
bucklers,
too,
and
empty
wagons
which
they
could
carry
off.
They
used
all
these
to
boil
the
meat
which
they
ate
that
day.
It
was
already
about
full-market
time
when
messengers
came
from
the
king,
heralds
of
the
country,
and
one
Hellene
among
them,
Phalinos,
who
happened
to
be
with
Tissaphernes
and
highly
respected;
for
he
claimed
to
be
expert
in
tactics
and
fighting
in
arms.
These
came
and
summoned
the
captains,
and
said,
“The
king
having
killed
Cyros
and
won
the
victory,
commands
the
Hellenes
to
lay
down
their
arms,
and
find
at
the
king’s
door
what
good
they
can.”
Such
was
the
king’s
message.
The
Hellenes
were
very
angry,
but
Clearchos
only
said,
“It
is
not
for
victors
to
lay
down
their
arms.”
Then
to
the
other
captains,
“You,
my
fellow-captains,
answer
these
gentlemen
as
you
think
fairest
and
best;
I
will
be
here
in
a
moment,”
for
a
servant
had
just
called
him
to
see
the
sacred
parts
which
had
been
taken
out
from
a
victim
which
was
being
sacrificed.
Then
Cleanor
the
Arcadian,
eldest
of
them,
said
they
would
die
sooner
than
lay
down
their
arms;
and
Proxenos
the
Theban
said,
“I
wonder,
Phalinos,
whether
the
king
speaks
as
conqueror
or
asks
our
arms
as
a
friendly
gift.
If
as
conqueror,
why
does
not
he
come
and
take
them?
If
he
wants
us
to
yield
them
willingly,
let
him
tell
us
what
the
soldiers
will
have
left,
if
they
make
him
a
present
of
these?”
Phalinos
answered,
“The
king
considers
he
is
victor,
since
he
has
killed
Cyros.
For
who
is
there
who
will
challenge
him
for
his
empire?
He
considers
that
you
also
are
his,
because
he
holds
you
in
the
midst
of
his
country,
surrounded
by
impassable
rivers,
and
he
can
bring
against
you
such
a
multitude
of
men
as
you
could
not
kill
if
you
had
the
chance.”
Theopompos
the
Athenian
followed
and
said,
“My
dear
Phalinos,
we
have
nothing
good
here,
as
you
see,
except
arms
and
courage.
While
we
keep
our
arms,
we
think
we
can
use
our
courage;
but
if
we
give
them
up,
we
shall
lose
our
lives
too.”
Hearing
this,
Phalinos
laughed,
and
said,
“Why,
you
are
quite
a
philosopher,
young
man,
you
speak
neatly;
but
let
me
tell
you
that
you
are
foolish
if
you
think
your
courage
can
overcome
the
king’s
power.”
A
few
others,
it
is
reported,
showed
a
little
weakness,
and
said
they
had
been
faithful
to
Cyros,
and
the
king
might
find
them
valuable
if
he
liked
to
be
their
friend;
he
might
use
them
for
a
campaign
into
Egypt
or
something
else,
and
they
would
go.
At
this
moment
Clearchos
returned
and
asked
whether
they
had
given
their
answer.
Phalinos
broke
in,
and
said,
“These
people
say
all
sorts
of
things,
Clearchos;
tell
us
what
you
say.”
He
answered,
“I
was
glad
to
see
you,
Phalinos,
and
so
were
the
others,
I
think;
you
are
a
Hellene,
and
so
are
we,
every
one
of
us
that
you
see
before
you.
In
our
present
case
we
ask
your
advice
as
to
what
we
ought
to
do.
Advise
us
in
God’s
name
what
you
think
fairest
and
best,
something
that
will
do
you
honour
when
it
is
reported
in
time
to
come:
how
Phalinos
was
once
sent
by
the
king
to
command
Hellenes
to
lay
down
their
arms,
and
they
asked
his
advice,
and
this
was
his
advice.
You
know
it
is
inevitable,
that
whatever
you
advise
will
be
told
all
over
Hellas.”
Clearchos
gave
these
hints
hoping
that
the
king’s
ambassador
might
advise
them
himself
not
to
lay
down
their
arms,
and
then
the
others
would
be
more
confident.
But
Phalinos
did
the
opposite;
he
turned
round,
and
said,
“This
is
my
advice.
If
you
have
one
hope
in
ten
thousand
to
make
war
against
the
king,
and
to
save
your
lives,
do
not
lay
down
your
arms.
But
if
there
is
no
hope
whatever
of
safety
against
the
king’s
wish,
I
advise
you
to
save
yourselves
in
the
one
way
you
can.”
Clearchos
answered
to
this,
“Very
well,
that
is
what
you
say:
from
us
take
this
answer.
We
believe
that
if
we
are
to
be
friends
to
the
king,
we
should
be
more
valuable
friends
with
arms
than
without;
and
if
we
are
to
make
war,
it
is
better
to
make
war
with
arms
than
without.”
Phalinos
said,
“We
will
take
back
this
answer;
let
me
say
that
the
king
added,
that
there
shall
be
a
truce
if
you
stay
where
you
are,
but
if
you
move
forwards
or
move
backwards,
war.
Answer
this
too,
then:
will
you
stay,
and
is
there
a
truce?
Or
shall
I
report
that
there
is
war?”
“Report
then,”
said
Clearchos,
“that
our
view
is
the
same
as
the
king’s.”
“What
does
that
mean?”
said
Phalinos.
Clearchos
answered,
“If
we
stay
where
we
are,
a
truce,
if
we
move
forwards
or
backwards,
war.”
He
asked
again,
“Truce
or
war,
which?”
Clearchos
made
the
same
answer
again,
“Truce
if
we
stay
here,
war
if
we
move
forwards
or
backwards.”
But
he
did
not
indicate
which
he
meant
to
do.
2.2
So
Phalinos
departed
and
those
with
him.
Then
Procles
and
Cheirisophos
returned
from
Ariaios,
but
Menon
stayed
with
him.
These
reported
that
Ariaios
said
there
were
many
Persians
better
than
himself
who
would
never
let
him
be
king;
“but
if
you
wish
to
go
away
with
him,
he
tells
you
to
come
to-night.
Otherwise
he
says
he
will
go
early
in
the
morning.”
Clearchos
said,
“Very
good,
so
be
it.
If
we
come,
then
as
you
say;
if
not,
do
whatever
you
think
most
profitable
for
yourselves.”
But
he
did
not
tell
these
either
what
he
meant
to
do.
After
this,
when
the
sun
was
already
sinking,
he
called
the
captains
and
other
officers
together,
and
spoke
to
them.
“Gentlemen,”
he
said,
“I
sacrifice
for
advance
against
the
king,
and
the
omens
were
not
favourable.
There
is
perhaps
nothing
strange
in
that;
for
between
us
and
the
king
is
the
Tigris,
a
navigable
river
which
we
could
not
cross
without
boats,
and
boats
we
have
none.
However,
we
cannot
stay
where
we
are,
for
we
cannot
get
provisions.
But
for
going
to
the
friends
of
Cyros
the
omens
were
completely
favourable.
This
is
what
we
must
do.
Dismiss,
and
dine
on
what
we
can
find:
when
the
first
horn
sounds
for
turning
in,
pack
up;
at
the
second,
put
the
stuff
on
the
animals;
at
the
third,
follow
your
guide,
keeping
the
animals
next
to
the
river,
and
the
shields
outside.”
The
captains
and
officers
did
so;
and
for
the
rest,
he
led
and
they
followed—not
that
they
chose
him,
but
they
saw
that
he
alone
understood
what
the
leader
ought
to
do,
and
the
others
were
inexperienced.
After
this,
when
darkness
came,
Miltocythes
the
Thracian
deserted
to
the
king,
taking
with
him
his
horsemen,
forty
in
number,
and
some
three
hundred
of
the
Thracian
footmen.
Clearchos
led
the
others
as
he
had
told
them,
and
they
followed,
and
they
reached
Ariaios
and
his
force
at
the
first
stage-house,
about
midnight.
They
grounded
arms
in
their
ranks;
and
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
captains
and
other
officers
with
Ariaios.
The
Hellenes
and
Ariaios
and
the
chief
of
those
with
him
swore
to
be
allies
and
to
be
faithful
to
one
another;
the
nationals
also
swore
to
lead
the
way
honestly.
This
they
swore,
cutting
the
throats
of
a
bull
and
a
boar
and
a
ram
over
a
shield:
the
Hellenes
dipt
a
sword
in
the
blood,
the
Asiatics
a
spear.
When
the
oath
had
been
taken,
Clearchos
said:
“Now
then,
Ariaios,
since
the
same
journey
is
before
us
all,
tell
me
what
notion
you
have
of
the
road.
Are
we
to
return
the
same
way
as
we
came,
or
have
you
thought
of
another
that
seems
better?”
He
said,
“If
we
go
back
by
the
way
we
came,
we
should
perish
of
hunger
outright;
for
we
have
no
provisions
now.
Even
on
our
way
here
we
got
nothing
at
all
from
the
country
on
the
seventeen
last
stages;
where
there
was
anything
we
have
used
it
all
up
on
the
march
already.
The
way
we
think
of
taking
now
is
longer,
but
there
will
be
no
lack
of
provisions.
We
must
make
the
first
stages
as
long
as
we
can,
that
we
may
get
away
from
the
royal
army
as
far
as
we
can;
for
if
once
we
can
put
two
or
three
days’
journey
between
us,
the
king
will
never
be
able
to
catch
us.
With
a
small
force
he
will
not
dare
to
follow;
with
a
large
force
he
will
not
be
able
to
go
fast,
perhaps
he
will
even
fall
short
of
provisions.
That’s
my
opinion,”
he
said.
This
plan
of
campaign
meant
nothing
more
than
to
cut
and
run;
but
fortune
planned
better.
When
day
came,
they
marched
with
the
sun
on
their
right
hand,
calculating
that
by
sunset
they
would
reach
villages
in
the
Babylonian
country;
and
in
this
they
were
not
deceived.
But
while
it
was
still
afternoon
they
thought
they
saw
enemy
horsemen;
and
those
of
the
Hellenes
who
were
not
in
their
ranks
fell
in,
and
Ariaios
(who
was
travelling
in
a
wagon
because
he
had
been
wounded)
got
down
and
put
on
his
corselet,
and
so
did
those
with
him.
While
they
were
arming,
their
scouts
came
back
reporting
they
were
not
cavalrymen
but
pack-animals
grazing.
And
they
soon
understood
that
the
king
was
encamped
somewhere
near,
for
smoke
was
seen
in
villages
not
far
off.
But
Clearchos
did
not
lead
against
the
enemy,
for
he
knew
that
the
men
were
weary
and
hungry,
and
it
was
late
already;
yet
he
kept
straight
on
without
swerving,
for
he
would
not
let
them
think
he
was
running
away,
and
at
sunset
he
brought
up
his
van
to
the
nearest
villages
and
encamped.
From
these
everything
had
been
stript
by
the
royal
army,
down
to
the
woodwork
of
the
cottages.
However,
the
first
men
encamped
after
a
fashion,
and
those
behind
coming
along
in
the
dark
lay
in
the
open
as
it
chanced,
and
they
made
a
great
noise
calling
to
one
another,
so
that
even
the
enemy
heard;
and
the
nearest
of
the
enemy
even
fled
out
of
their
encampment.
This
became
clear
next
day;
for
not
an
animal
was
to
be
seen,
no
camp,
no
smoke
anywhere
near.
The
king
himself
was
frightened,
as
it
seemed,
at
the
army’s
approach,
as
he
made
clear
by
what
he
did
the
day
after.
However,
as
the
night
went
on
a
panic
fell
on
the
Hellenes
also
and
there
was
din
and
disturbance
as
one
might
expect
in
a
panic.
Clearchos
sent
round
Tolmides
the
Elean,
the
herald
who
was
with
him
as
it
happened,
the
best
herald
of
his
time;
he
was
to
call
for
silence,
and
proclaim
from
headquarters,
one
talent
reward
for
information
who
let
the
ass
loose
in
the
camp.
When
this
was
proclaimed,
the
men
knew
that
it
was
an
empty
panic
and
the
commanders
were
safe
and
sound.
At
break
of
day
Clearchos
ordered
the
Hellenes
to
form
in
line
in
the
same
position
which
they
had
in
the
battle.
2.3
It
was
clear
now
that
the
king
had
been
terrified
by
their
approach,
as
I
wrote
above;
for
the
day
before
he
had
commanded
them
to
lay
down
their
arms,
but
now
at
sunrise
he
sent
heralds
to
treat
for
a
truce.
When
they
reached
the
outposts,
these
went
in
search
of
their
commanders;
and
Clearchos,
who
happened
to
be
then
reviewing
the
lines,
heard
the
report
of
the
outposts,
and
sent
back
word
that
the
heralds
were
to
wait
until
he
had
leisure.
When
he
had
arranged
his
army
so
that
a
solid
array
could
be
easily
seen
everywhere,
with
no-one
visible
outside
the
forces,
he
summoned
the
mission,
and
went
to
meet
them
with
the
best
armed
and
finest
men
he
had,
and
told
the
other
captains
to
do
the
same.
When
he
came
up
to
the
mission,
he
asked
what
they
wanted.
They
answered
that
they
came
to
arrange
a
truce,
with
full
powers
from
the
king
to
treat
with
the
Hellenes,
and
to
report
their
proposals
to
the
king.
Clearchos
then
said,
“Report
to
him,
then,
that
first
there
must
be
battle;
we
have
no
breakfast,
and
no
man
shall
dare
to
speak
of
truce
to
Hellenes
without
providing
breakfast.”
When
the
embassy
heard
this,
they
rode
away,
and
soon
came
back;
so
it
was
plain
that
the
king
was
somewhere
near,
or
someone
whose
duty
it
was
to
arrange
things.
They
said
that
the
king
thought
it
a
reasonable
request,
and
they
had
brought
guides
to
take
them
where
they
would
find
breakfast,
if
they
could
arrange
a
truce.
Clearchos
asked
whether
the
truce
was
offered
just
for
the
men
as
they
went
and
came
back,
or
was
it
a
general
truce
for
all.
They
replied,
“For
all,
until
we
give
our
report
to
the
king.”
When
they
had
finished,
Clearchos
removed
them
and
held
council;
and
it
seemed
best
to
accept
this
truce
and
quietly
to
go
and
get
the
provisions.
So
he
said,
“I
agree
with
that,
but
I
will
not
tell
them
at
once;
I
will
delay
until
the
ambassadors
are
anxious
for
fear
we
may
refuse
to
make
truce.
I
think,
however,”
he
said,
“that
our
own
men
will
fear
the
same!”
Whon
he
thought
it
was
the
right
time,
he
announced
that
he
would
make
truce,
and
bade
them
lead
him
at
once
to
the
provisions.
So
they
did;
but
Clearchos,
although
he
had
made
the
truce,
marched
with
the
army
in
battle
order,
himself
commanding
the
rearguard.
They
came
on
ditches
and
canals
full
of
water,
which
they
could
not
cross
without
bridges;
but
they
managed
by
making
bridges
of
fallen
date-palms
or
others
which
they
cut
down.
Then
one
could
learn
what
a
commander
Clearchos
was.
In
his
left
hand
he
held
the
spear,
a
stick
in
his
right;
and
if
he
thought
there
was
any
shirking,
he
picked
out
the
right
man
and
gave
him
one,
and
also
he
lent
a
hand
himself,
jumping
into
the
mud,
so
that
all
were
ashamed
not
to
work
as
hard
as
he
did.
Those
of
thirty
years
and
under
were
told
off
for
this
job;
but
when
they
saw
how
keen
Clearchos
was,
the
older
men
helped.
What
made
him
more
anxious
was
that
he
suspected
the
ditches
were
not
always
so
full
of
water,
for
it
was
not
the
season
for
watering
the
plain;
he
thought
the
king
might
have
let
in
this
water
on
purpose
to
show
them
how
many
dangers
they
would
meet
on
the
march.
At
last
they
reached
villages
from
which
the
guides
directed
them
to
take
the
provisions.
There
was
plenty
of
corn
and
date-wine
and
a
sour
drink
made
by
boiling
dates.
The
palm-nuts
or
date-nuts
which
we
see
in
our
country
are
such
as
were
kept
for
servants;
but
those
reserved
for
the
masters
were
select,
wonderfully
fine
and
large,
just
like
amber
in
colour:
and
some
they
dry
and
store
for
delicacies.
These
were
delicious
as
a
relish
for
wine,
but
they
give
headache.
That
was
the
first
time
the
men
tasted
the
brain
or
top-cabbage
of
the
palm,
and
most
of
them
were
surprised
at
the
shape
and
peculiar
flavour.
This
also
was
very
apt
to
give
headache.
When
the
brain
was
taken
from
the
palm,
the
whole
tree
withered.
There
they
remained
three
days.
Then
arrived
Tissaphernes,
and
the
queen’s
brother,
and
three
other
Persians,
with
a
long
train
of
slaves.
When
the
Hellenic
captains
met
them,
Tissaphernes
first
spoke
through
an
interpreter.
He
said:
“I
am
a
near
neighbour
to
Hellas,
gentlemen;
and
when
I
saw
you
follow
into
danger
and
difficulty,
I
thought
it
a
grand
opportunity
if
I
could
persuade
the
king
as
a
favour
to
let
me
bring
you
back
safe
to
Hellas;
for
I
think
that
would
earn
me
your
thanks
and
your
country’s.
With
this
intention
I
put
my
petition
before
the
king,
saying
that
he
might
fairly
gratify
me
because
I
first
told
him
that
Cyros
was
advancing
against
him,
and
I
brought
him
aid
along
with
my
news;
and
I
alone
of
all
those
who
faced
the
Hel-
Jenes
did
not
take
to
flight,
but
I
rode
through
and
joined
the
king
in
your
camp
which
he
had
then
reached,
after
killing
Cyros
and
pursuing
the
nationals
with
Cyros
along
with
the
forces
which
are
with
me
now,
the
most
loyal
of
all
his
men.
He
promised
me
that
he
would
consider
this;
but
he
told
me
to
come
and
ask
why
yéu
made
war
upon
him.
And
I
advise
you
to
answer
moderately
that
it
may
be
easier
for
me
to
find
how
I
may
arrange
something
good
for
you.”
The
Hellenes
retired
and
consulted
what
to
say;
and
they
answered,
Clearchos
being
spokesman:
“We
did
not
assemble
to
make
war
on
the
king,
nor
did
we
march
against
the
king;
but
Cyros
found
many
excuses,
as
you
know
well
yourself,
that
he
might
catch
you
unprepared
and
bring
us
here.
However,
when
we
saw
him
in
danger,
we
were
really
ashamed
before
gods
and
men
to
desert
him,
after
offering
ourselves
to
him
long
since
for
his
service.
But
now
that
Cyros
is
dead,
we
do
not
lay
claim
to
the
king’s
empire,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
damage
the
king’s
country
or
wish
to
kill
the
king
himself.
We
wish
to
march
home,
if
no-one
molests
us;
but
if
we
are
injured
we
shall
try
to
defend
ourselves,
with
God’s
help.
If
moreover,
anyone
turns
up
to
help
us,
we
shall
be
no
less
ready
to
help
him
as
far
as
we
can.”
Tissaphernes
listened
to
him,
and
said,
“I
will
report
this
to
the
king,
and
bring
back
his
answer.
Until
I
return
let
the
truce
be
kept,
and
I
will
provide
you
a
market.”
Next
day
he
did
not
return,
and
the
Hellenes
were
anxious;
but
he
came
the
day
after,
and
said
he
had
procured
from
the
king
the
boon
of
safety
for
the
Hellenes,
although
many
had
urged
that
it
was
unworthy
for
the
king
to
let
go
those
who
had
made
war
against
him.
At
the
end
he
said,
“Now
you
may
receive
our
promise
to
keep
the
country
at
peace
with
you,
and
to
take
you
back
to
Hellas
without
fraud;
we
will
provide
a
market,
and
wherever
you
cannot
buy,
we
will
allow
you
to
take
what
is
necessary
from
the
country.
You
on
your
part
must
take
your
oath
to
march
as
through
a
friendly
country,
only
taking
food
and
drink
without
violence
whenever
we
do
not
provide
a
market,
but
when
we
do
you
must
buy
provisions.”
This
was
agreed;
they
took
the
oath,
and
Tissaphernes
and
the
queen’s
brother
gave
their
right
hands
to
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
Hellenes,
and
these
did
the
like.
After
this
Tissaphernes
said,
“Now,
then,
I
return
to
the
king;
when
I
have
arranged
what
I
wish,
I
will
come
back
ready
to
conduct
you
to
Hellas,
and
myself
to
return
to
my
province.”
2.4
After
this
the
Hellenes
and
Ariaios
waited
for
Tissaphernes,
encamped
near
each
other,
for
more
than
twenty
days.
Meanwhile
Ariaios
was
visited
by
brothers
and
other
relations,
and
some
of
his
people
had
visits
from
Persians,
who
encouraged
them,
and
brought
pledges
to
some
from
the
king,
that
the
king
would
bear
no
malice
against
them
for
their
campaign
with
Cyros
or
for
anything
else
now
bygone.
While
this
went
on
Ariaios’s
people
clearly
began
to
think
less
about
the
Hellenes.
So
for
this
reason
they
displeased
many
of
the
Hellenes;
and
these
complained
to
Clearchos
and
the
other
captains,
and
said,
“What
are
we
waiting
for?
Don’t
we
know
that
the
king
would
give
anything
to
destroy
us,
and
show
our
whole
nation
what
a
terror
it
is
to
make
war
on
the
Great
King?
Now
he
deludes
us
to
stay
because
his
army
is
scattered;
but
when
the
whole
army
is
assembled
again
there
is
no
doubt
he
will
attack
us.
Perhaps
they
are
digging
somewhere
or
fortifying
somewhere
to
make
the
road
impassable.
He
will
never
be
willing,
if
he
can
help
it,
that
we
shall
go
back
to
Hellas
and
report
that
a
few
men
like
us
beat
the
king
in
front
of
his
own
door,
and
got
away
to
laugh
at
him.”
Clearchos
answered,
“I
have
all
this
in
my
own
mind,
but
I
remember
that
if
we
go
now
he
will
think
we
have
broken
the
truce
and
gone
out
for
war.
Then
again,
firstly
no-one
will
make
us
a
market
or
help
us
to
get
provisions;
secondly,
there
will
be
no-one
to
guide
us;
thirdly,
if
we
do
anything
like
that
Ariaios
will
leave
us
at
once.
So
we
shall
not
have
one
friend
left,
and
even
those
who
were
friends
will
be
our
enemies.
Then
the
river:
if
there
is
any
other
difficult
river
for
us
I
don’t
know,
but
the
Euphrates
we
know
cannot
be
crossed
if
the
enemy
oppose.
Further,
we
have
no
cavalry
to
help
us
if
we
must
fight,
but
the
enemy
have
plenty,
and
very
good;
so
if
we
win,
how
could
we
kill
anyone?
And
if
we
are
beaten,
none
of
us
could
escape.
As
for
the
king,
with
all
these
things
in
his
favour,
if
he
really
wishes
to
destroy
us,
I
don’t
know
why
we
need
swear
oaths
and
give
pledges,
and
then
by
perjury
make
his
own
word
worthless
to
all
the
world,
both
ours
and
his!”
He
would
often
speak
like
this.
Meanwhile
Tissaphernes
came
with
his
forces,
as
on
the
road
home,
and
Orontas
came
with
his;
he
brought
also
the
king’s
daughter,
his
bride.
They
left
the
place
at
once,
Tissaphernes
leading
and
providing
a
market;
Ariaios
marched
also
at
the
head
of
Cyros’s
national
force,
along
with
Tissaphernes
and
Orontas,
and
camped
with
them.
But
the
Hellenes
suspected
these,
and
kept
to
themselves
with
their
own
guides.
They
always
camped
with
a
distance
between
them,
a
league
or
more;
both
parties
watched
each
other
like
enemies,
and
this
at
once
made
more
suspicion.
Sometimes
when
they
were
gathering
wood
from
the
same
place,
and
foraging
for
grass
and
such
things,
they
came
to
blows
with
each
other,
and
this
made
more
hostility.
After
they
had
gone
three
stages
they
reached
what
is
called
the
Wall
of
Media,
and
passed
behind
it.
This
was
built
of
baked
bricks
set
in
asphalt,
twenty
feet
thick,
one
hundred
high;
its
length
was
said
to
be
twenty
leagues,
and
it
is
not
far
from
Babylon.
From
this
place
they
marched
two
stages,
8
leagues;
and
they
crossed
two
canals,
one
by
a
bridge,
one
by
eight
boats
fastened
together.
These
canals
came
from
the
River
Tigris;
trenches
are
dug
from
them
over
the
land,
the
first
larger,
then
smaller
ones,
until
at
last
they
become
little
runnels
such
as
we
have
in
Hellas
over
millet
fields.
Then
they
reached
the
Tigris,
near
which
was
a
city,
large
and
populous,
named
Sittace,
distant
frora
the
river
about
a
mile
and
a
half.
The
Hellenes
encamped
near
it
beside
a
park,
large
and
beautiful
and
thick
with
all
sorts
of
trees;
but
the
nationals
crossed
the
river
first,
where
they
were
quite
hidden
from
view.
After
dinner
it
happened
that
Proxenos
and
Xenophon
were
walking
in
front
of
the
camp,
and
a
man
asked
the
sentries
where
he
could
see
Proxenos
or
Clearchos;
he
did
not
ask
for
Menon,
although
he
came
from
Ariaios,
Menon’s
friend.
When
Proxenos
said,
“I’m
the
man
you
are
looking
for,”
the
fellow
said,
“I
have
been
sent
by
Ariaios
and
Artaozos,
who
were
true
to
Cyros
and
remain
loyal
to
you.
They
bid
you
be
on
your
guard
against
an
attack
to-night;
there
is
quite
an
army
close
by
in
the
park.
And
they
bid
you
to
send
a
guard
for
the
Tigris
bridge,
because
Tissaphernes
intends
to
break
it
down
to-night
that
you
may
not
cross
but
may
be
caught
between
the
river
and
the
canal.”
Hearing
this
they
took
him
to
Clearchos,
and
told
him
what
he
said.
Clearchos
was
very
much
upset
and
alarmed.
But
a
young
man
present
observed
that
the
attack
and
breaking
down
the
bridge
did
not
fit
well
together.
“If
they
attack,”
he
said,
“they
must
either
win
or
lose.
If
they
win,
why
break
down
the
bridge?
For
then
we
could
never
escape
and
be
safe
however
many
bridges
there
are.
But
if
we
win,
with
a
broken
bridge
they
will
never
escape
themselves;
nor
will
any
of
that
multitude
across
the
river
be
able
to
help
them
with
a
broken
bridge.”
Clearchos
listened,
and
asked
the
messenger
how
much
country
there
was
between
the
Tigris
and
the
canal.
He
said
a
great
deal,
and
many
villages
and
many
large
cities.
Then
he
understood
at
once
that
the
Persians
had
sent
the
man,
for
fear
the
Hellenes
might
cut
the
bridge
and
stay
in
the
island,
defended
by
the
Tigris
on
one
side
and
the
canal
on
the
other,
and
might
get
their
provisions
from
the
country
between,
which
was
large
and
good
with
plenty
of
hands
to
till
it;
then
again,
it
might
be
a
refuge
for
anyone
who
wanted
to
damage
the
king.
After
this
they
went
to
rest;
however,
they
still
sent
a
guard
for
the
bridge.
And
no-one
attacked
them
from
any
part,
and
none
of
the
enemy
came
to
the
bridge,
as
the
guards
reported.
But
at
dawn
they
crossed
the
bridge,
which
was
made
of
thirty-seven
vessels
fastened
together;
they
took
all
possible
precautions,
for
some
Hellenes
from
Tissaphernes
brought
word
that
they
meant
to
attack
while
they
were
crossing,
But
this
was
false;
however,
as
they
were
crossing
Gliis
appeared
with
some
scouts
to
see
if
they
were
crossing
the
river,
and
when
he
saw
he
galloped
away.
From
the
Tigris
they
marched
four
stages,
20
leagues,
to
the
River
Physcos,
breadth
roo
feet;
there
was
a
bridge
across.
There
also
was
a
large
city,
named
Opis.
There
the
Hellenes
were
met
by
the
bastard
brother
of
Cyros
and
Artaxerxes,
from
Susa
and
Ecbatana,
bringing
a
large
army
to
support
the
king;
and
halting
his
army
he
watched
the
Hellenes
passing
by.
Clearchos
led
them
two
abreast,
sometimes
marching
and
sometimes
halting.
As
long
as
the
leading
section
of
the
army
halted,
so
long
there
must
be
a
halt
through
the
whole
army;
so
as
the
command
ran
down
the
whole
army
seemed
to
be
enormous,
even
to
the
Hellenes
themselves,
and
the
Persian
was
dumbfounded
at
the
sight.
Thence
they
marched
through
Media
seven
desert
stages,
30
leagues,
as
far
as
the
villages
of
Parysatis,
the
mother
of
Cyros
and
Artaxerxes.
These
Tissaphernes
in
mockery
of
Cyros
gave
over
to
the
Hellenes
to
plunder,
but
no
captives
to
be
taken.
There
was
plenty
of
corn
there
and
sheep
and
other
things.
From
there
they
marched
four
desert
stages,
20
leagues,
keeping
the
Tigris
on
the
left.
At
the
first
stage
beyond
the
river
was
an
inhabited
city
named
Cainai,
large
and
prosperous,
from
which
the
natives
used
to
bring
over
on
rafts
of
skin,
loaves,
cheeses,
and
wine.
2.5
After
this
they
reached
the
River
Zapatas,
breadth
400
feet.
There
they
stayed
three
days;
at
this
time
there
were
suspicions,
but
no
manifest
plot.
So
Clearchos
resolved
to
approach
Tissaphernes,
and
see
whether
he
could
stop
these
suspicions
before
they
brought
war.
He
sent
word
that
he
wished
to
mect
him,
and
Tissaphernes
readily
invited
him
to
come.
When
they
went
Clearchos
said:
“I
know,
Tissaphernes,
that
oaths
have
been
sworn
and
pledges
given
between
us
that
we
will
not
harm
each
other;
but
I
see
you
watching
us
like
enemies,
and
we,
seeing
that,
watch
you
too.
But
as
by
my
inquiry
I
cannot
perceive
that
you
try
to
do
us
any
hurt,
and
I
know
well
that
we
never
think
even
of
such
a
thing,
I
thought
it
best
to
speak
to
you
in
hopes
we
may
get
rid
of
our
mutual
distrust,
For
I
know
it
has
often
happened
that
either
from
slander
or
from
suspicion
men
have
been
frightened
of
each
other,
and
wishing
to
get
in
first
before
they
suffer,
they
have
done
incurable
mischief
to
others
who
were
not
intending
to
do
anything
of
the
sort,
nor
indeed
wishing
to
do
it.
I
think
such
misunderstandings
are
best
ended
by
meeting
face
to
face;
so
here
I
am,
to
assure
you
that
you
have
no
reason
to
distrust
us.
The
first
and
chiefest
thing
is,
that
our
oaths
before
heaven
stop
us
from
being
enemies;
I
could
never
deem
one
happy
who
knows
he
has
disregarded
his
oath.
In
war
against
heaven,
what
speed
could
save?
What
place
could
be
a
refuge?
How
could
one
escape?
What
darkness
could
he
run
to?
What
stronghold
could
receive
him?
All
things
in
every
place
are
in
God’s
hands,
God
equally
rules
all,
That
is
what
I
think
about
the
oaths,
and
about
the
gods
before
whom
we
made
our
pact
of
friendship
and
deposited
it
there;
but
of
human
things,
I
think
at
this
present
you
are
the
best
thing
we
have.
For
with
you
every
road
is
easy,
every
river
can
be
passed,
there
is
no
want
of
provisions.
Without
you
every
road
goes
through
darkness,
for
we
know
nothing
about
it;
every
river
is
hard
to
cross,
every
crowd
terrible,
and
most
terrible
of
all
the
desert,
all
full
of
want.
If
indeed
we
were
so
mad
as
to
kill
you,
by
killing
our
benefactor
should
we
not
bring
into
the
ring
against
us
that
most
mighty
champion
in
reserve,
the
king
himself?
“Now
for
myself:
let
me
tell
you
what
high
hopes
and
prospects
I
should
rob
myself
of,
if
I
tried
to
do
you
any
harm.
I
wished
Cyros
to
be
my
friend
because
I
thought
him
most
able
to
benefit
anyone
he
might
wish;
but
you
I
see
now
in
his
place.
You
hold
the
power
and
domain
of
Cyros
and
keep
your
own
besides;
and
the
king’s
power,
which
was
Cyros’s
enemy,
is
your
ally.
This
being
so,
who
is
so
mad
that
he
does
not
wish
to
be
your
friend?
Besides,
I
will
tell
you
reasons
why
I
have
some
hope
that
you
will
wish
to
be
mine.
I
know
the
Mysians
are
a
nuisance
to
you,
and
I
think
I
could
make
them
humble
with
the
force
I
have
here.
I
know
about
the
Pisidians
too;
and
there
are
many
other
nations
like
that,
which
I
think
I
could
make
to
cease
from
troubling
your
happiness.
The
Egyptians,
too,
I
understand
you
Persians
are
very
angry
with
them;
and
I
don’t
see
any
force
which
could
help
you
to
punish
them
better
than
this
I
now
have.
Then
again,
take
your
own
neighbours;
if
you
wished
to
be
a
friend
you
could
be
the
greatest
friend,
and
suppose
anyone
annoyed
you,
as
master
you
might
turn
upon
him
if
you
had
us
to
serve
you,
for
we
should
serve
you,
not
for
the
pay,
but
for
the
gratitude
we
should
owe
for
saving
us.
“When
I
think
over
all
this
in
my
mind
it
seems
astonishing
that
you
distrust
us,
and
I
would
gladly
hear
you
tell
me
by
name
who
is
an
orator
clever
enough
to
persuade
you
that
we
are
plotting
against
you.”
Tissaphernes
then
answered
the
speech
of
Clearchos:
“Indeed
I
am
glad,
Clearchos,
to
hear
your
sensible
words.
For
if
that
is
your
mind,
I
think
you
would
be
your
own
enemy
as
well
as
mine
if
you
should
plan
mischief
against
me.
Listen,
and
I
will
show
you
that
you
have
just
as
little
reason
to
distrust
either
the
king
or
me.
If
we
wished
to
destroy
you,
do
you
think
we
lack
cavalry
or
infantry
or
armament,
quite
enough
to
damage
you
with
no
fear
of
suffering
any
harm
in
return?
Then
do
you
think
there
would
be
no
suitable
places
for
attack?
Remember
all
the
plains
which
you
traverse
with
such
hardship
even
while
they
are
friendly.
Look
at
all
the
mountains
you
must
cross,
which
we
could
occupy
before
you
and
make
impassable.
Think
of
all
the
great
rivers,
where
we
can
regulate
our
portions
and
decide
how
many
we
want
to
fight
with.
Some
of
them
you
could
not
possibly
cross
unless
we
ferried
you
over!
Even
if
we
should
fail
in
all
these,
at
least
let
me
remind
you,
‘Fire
is
stronger
than
fruit’;
we
could
burn
up
all
the
crops
and
enlist
famine
against
you—however
strong
you
are,
you
couldn’t
fight
that!
“Then
while
we
have
so
many
ways
to
make
war
upon
you,
all
without
danger
for
ourselves,
why
should
we
choose
the
only
way
which
is
impious
before
heaven,
the
only
way
which
is
disgraceful
before
men?
Men
must
be
wholly
helpless
and
resourceless
and
constrained
by
necessity,
and
they
must
be
wicked
too,
if
they
are
willing
to
use
perjury
to
God
and
treachery
to
men
in
doing
a
thing.
No,
Clear-
chos,
we
are
not
so
unreasonable
or
so
foolish
as
that.
Well,
then,
if
we
could
destroy
you,
why
did
we
not
go
so
far?
I
assure
you
the
reason
was
my
passion
to
be
trusted
by
the
Hellenes.
Cyros
came
up
country
trusting
to
this
mercenary
force,
and
I
wished
to
go
down
again,
made
strong
by
benefits
done
to
his
same
force.
How
you
can
be
useful
to
me
you
have
said,
at
least
partly,
but
the
greatest
thing
of
all,
I
know:
the
tiara
on
the
head
only
the
king
may
wear
upright,
but
the
tiara
on
the
heart
perhaps
with
you
to
help
another
might
find
it
easy
to
wear
so.”
Clearchos
thought
he
spoke
honestly,
and
he
said:
“Then
since
we
are
such
friends,
those
who
try
by
calumny
to
make
us
enemies
are
worthy
of
death?”
“Yes,”
Tissaphernes
said,
“and
if
your
captains
and
your
officers
will
come
here,
I
will
tell
you
openly
who
accuse
you
of
plotting
against
me
and
my
army.”
“Then
I
will
bring
them
all,”
said
Clearchos,
“and
I
will
reveal
to
you
also
where
I
hear
this
about
you.”
After
this
conversation
Tissaphernes
made
a
great
fuss
of
him,
and
asked
him
to
stay,
and
they
dined
together.
Next
day
when
Clearchos
came
back
to
the
camp
it
was
clear
that
he
thought
himself
great
in
friendship
with
Tissaphernes.
He
reported
what
he
had
said.
“We
must
all
go,”
he
said,
“as
he
asks,
and
any
of
us
who
are
proved
to
be
calumniating
him,
must
be
punished
as
traitors
and
enemies
to
us
all.”
But
he
suspected
the
calumniator
was
Menon;
for
he
knew
that
he
and
Ariaios
had
meetings
with
Tissaphernes,
and
that
he
was
intriguing
and
scheming
against
himself
in
order
to
get
command
of
the
whole
army
and
make
himself
a
friend
to
Tissaphernes,
Clearchos
also
wished
that
the
whole
army
should
follow
his
will,
and
that
troublesome
persons
should
be
out
of
the
way.
But
some
of
the
soldiers
protested
that
the
captains
and
officers
ought
not
all
to
go
and
trust
Tissaphernes.
But
Clearchos
insisted
strongly,
until
he
arranged
that
five
captains
should
go
and
twenty
other
officers;
and
about
two
hundred
soldiers
went
with
them
to
do
their
marketing.
When
they
reached
the
door
of
Tissaphernes
the
captains
were
invited
in,
Proxenos
the
Beeotian,
Menon
the
Thessalian,
Agias
the
Arcadian,
Clearchos
the
Laconian,
Socrates
the
Achaian;
the
other
officers
stayed
at
the
door.
A
little
while
afterwards,
at
one
signal,
those
inside
were
seized,
and
those
outside
were
cut
down.
Soon
after
a
number
of
barbarian
horsemen
rode
about
the
plain,
and
killed
every
Hellene
they
met,
slave
or
free.
The
men
wondered
at
this
display
of
horsemanship
from
the
camp,
and
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
until
a
fugitive
came
in,
Nicarchos,
an
Arcadian,
wounded
in
the
belly
and
holding
his
bowels
in
his
hands,
and
told
what
had
happened.
Then
all
the
Hellenes
ran
for
their
arms,
all
aghast,
expecting
they
would
come
to
the
camp
instantly.
They
did
not
all
come,
but
Ariaios
and
Artaozos
and
Mithradates
came,
who
had
been
Cyros’s
most
trusted
friends;
the
interpreter
of
the
Hellenes
said
he
saw
and
recognized
the
brother
of
Tissaphernes
with
them.
They
were
attended
by
some
three
hundred
Persians
in
corselets.
When
these
came
near
they
called
for
any
captain
or
officer
that
they
might
deliver
the
king’s
message.
After
this
two
captains
came
out,
carefully
guarded,
Cleanor
the
Orchomenian,
and
Sophainetos
the
Stymphalian,
and
with
them
Xenophon
the
Athenian,
who
wished
to
hear
news
of
Proxenos;
Cheirisophos
happened
to
be
absent
in
a
village
with
others
getting
provisions.
When
they
stood
within
hearing,
Ariaios
said:
“I
isten,
Hellenes.
Clearchos
was
shown
to
have
perjured
himself
and
broken
the
truce;
therefore
he
has
been
punished
and
he
is
dead;
but
Proxenos
and
Menon,
because
they
reported
his
plot,
are
in
high
honour.
You
lay
down
your
arms,
that
is
the
king’s
demand;
he
says
they
are
his,
because
they
belonged
to
Cyros
his
slave.”
The
Hellenes
made
Cleanor
their
spokesman
to
answer,
and
he
said,
“You
abominable
wretch
Ariaios,
and
you
others
who
were
friends
of
Cyros,
have
you
no
shame
before
gods
and
men?
You
swore
the
oath
to
have
the
same
friends
and
enemies
as
we
did,
and
you
have
betrayed
us,
with
Tissaphernes,
that
most
impious
and
godless
villain!
You
have
murdered
the
very
man
to
whom
you
gave
your
oath,
and
you
have
betrayed
us
all,
and
you
join
our
enemies
to
come
against
us!”
Ariaios
replied,
“Because
Clearchos
was
proved
to
have
plotted
first
against
Tissaphernes
and
Orontas,
and
against
us
all
who
are
with
them.”
Xenophon
rejoined
upon
this,
“Clearchos,
then,
is
punished,
if
he
broke
the
truce
contrary
to
his
oath,
for
the
perjured
are
justly
put
to
death,
but
what
of
Proxenos
and
Menon?
They
are
your
benefactors,
and
they
are
our
captains,
then
send
them
here;
for
it
is
clear
that
being
friends
to
both
parties
they
will
try
to
advise
the
best
both
for
you
and
for
us.”
The
barbarians
discussed
this
for
a
long
time,
and
then
went
away
without
answering
a
word.
2.6
The
captains,
captured
thus,
were
carried
up
to
the
king
and
there
beheaded.
One
of
them,
Clearchos,
was
a
true
soldier
and
war
was
his
passion,
as
all
agreed
who
formed
their
opinions
from
personal
knowledge.
As
long
as
the
war
lasted
between
Lacedaimon
and
Athens,
he
stayed
at
home;
but
when
peace
came
he
persuaded
his
own
city
that
the
Thracians
were
injuring
the
Hellenes;
and
having
managed
as
well
as
he
could
with
the
ephors,
he
sailed
to
make
war
on
the
Thracians
beyond
Chersonese
and
Perinthos.
However,
the
ephors
changed
their
minds
as
soon
as
he
had
set
out,
and
tried
to
turn
him
back
from
the
Isthmus;
but
he
would
not
obey
them
any
longer,
and
sailed
away
to
the
Hellespont.
Consequently
he
was
sentenced
to
death
by
the
Spartan
government
for
disobedience
to
orders.
He
was
already
a
banished
man
when
he
came
to
Cyros.
What
arguments
he
used
to
persuade
Cyros
have
been
written
elsewhere
not
known
where
;
at
least
Cyros
gave
him
10,000
darics.
He
took
the
money,
but
he
did
not
turn
to
a
lazy
life:
no,
with
this
money
he
collected
a
force
and
made
war
on
the
Thracians,
and
conquered
them
in
battle;
he
ravaged
them
after
that,
and
went
on
with
the
war
until
Cyros
wanted
his
army—then
he
went
off
to
make
war
again
under
him.
These
seem
to
me
the
doings
of
a
man
whose
passion
was
war.
When
he
could
have
kept
at
peace
without
shame
or
damage,
he
chose
war;
when
he
could
have
been
idle,
he
wished
for
hard
work
that
he
might
have
war;
when
he
could
have
kept
wealth
without
danger,
he
chose
to
make
it
less
by
making
war;
there
was
a
man
who
spent
upon
war
as
if
it
were
a
darling
lover
or
some
other
pleasure.
So
war
was
his
passion;
and
he
seemed
a
true
soldier,
because
he
loved
perils;
ready
to
lead
against
the
enemy
by
day
or
by
night,
and
he
kept
his
head
in
danger,
as
those
with
him
agreed
one
and
all
in
every
place.
He
had
also
the
repute
of
a
true
leader,
as
far
as
was
possible
for
a
man
of
his
character.
He
was
able
to
think
out
ways
to
get
provisions
for
his
forces,
and
then
to
get
them;
and
he
was
able
to
fix
firmly
in
their
minds
that
Clearchos
must
be
obeyed.
This
he
did
by
being
severe;
he
was
grim
to
look
at
and
harsh
in
voice,
he
punished
heavily
and
sometimes
in
anger,
so
that
now
and
again
he
was
sorry
for
it.
And
he
punished
on
principle,
for
he
thought
an
unpunished
army
was
good
for
nothing;
indeed,
he
used
to
say
that
a
soldier
ought
to
fear
his
commander
more
than
the
enemy,
if
he
was
to
keep
guard,
or
keep
his
hand
off
friends,
or
attack
the
enemy
without
excuses.
In
danger,
however,
the
soldiers
wished
absolutely
to
obey
him
and
chose
no
other;
at
such
times
his
grimness
appeared
brightness,
they
said,
his
severity
seemed
strength
against
the
enemy,
so
that
they
thought
it
salvation
rather
than
severity.
But
when
the
danger
was
past,
many
left
him
if
there
was
an
opportunity
to
pass
over
to
other
commanders;
for
he
had
no
charm,
and
he
was
always
severe
and
cruel,
so
the
soldiers
felt
towards
him
as
boys
towards
a
schoolmaster.
Indeed,
he
never
found
any
to
follow
him
for
affection
and
friendship;
but
those
who
were
put
under
his
charge
by
some
authority,
or
through
need
or
some
other
constraint,
he
found
completely
obedient,
But
when
they
began
to
succeed
in
conquering
an
enemy
under
him,
his
men
had
strong
motives
to
make
them
useful;
for
one
thing,
they
felt
confident
of
victory,
and
for
another
they
feared
punishment
from
him,
which
made
them
obedient.
Such
was
Clearchos
as
a
commander;
but
it
was
said
he
did
not
like
very
much
to
be
commanded
himself.
He
was
about
fifty
years
old
when
he
died.
Proxenos
the
Beeotian
ever
since
the
days
of
his
youth
had
longed
to
become
a
man
capable
of
doing
great
things;
and
because
of
this
longing
he
paid
his
fees
to
Gorgias
of
Lentinoi.
the
rhetorician,
who
asked
100
minae
After
being
with
Gorgias
he
thought
himself
at
once
quite
capable
of
being
a
ruler,
and
since
he
was
a
friend
of
the
first
men
of
his
day
he
thought
himself
the
equal
of
any
man
as
a
benefactor.
In
this
spirit
he
took
part
in
the
business
of
Cyros;
he
believed
he
should
get
a
great
name
from
this,
and
great
power
and
wealth.
Yet
although
he
longed
so
much
for
these
great
things,
all
the
same
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
did
not
wish
to
get
any
of
them
by
injustice;
with
justice
and
honour
he
thought
these
things
ought
to
be
got,
but
not
without.
To
rule
gentlemen
he
was
well
able,
but
still
he
could
not
put
fear
or
respect
for
himself
into
his
soldiers.
Indeed,
he
had
rather
respect
for
the
soldiers
than
they
had
for
him,
and
he
obviously
feared
rather
to
be
disliked
by
the
soldiers
than
the
soldiers
feared
to
disobey
him.
He
thought
that
to
praise
one
who
did
well,
and
not
to
praise
the
offender,
was
enough
to
make
a
ruler
and
the
reputation
of
a
ruler.
Therefore
the
gentlemen
among
his
associates
liked
him
and
wished
him
well,
but
common
men
schemed
against
him
and
thought
him
easy
game.
When
he
died,
he
was
about
thirty
years
old.
There
was
no
doubt
about
Menon
the
Thessalian
This
is
again
Plato’s
Menon,
who
is
a
bappier
figure
in
those
pages.
;
it
was
obvious
that
he
desired
with
all
his
heart
to
be
rich,
that
he
desired
to
rule
in
order
that
he
might
get
more,
that
he
desired
to
be
honoured
in
order
that
he
might
make
more
profit.
He
wished
to
be
friend
to
the
most
powerful
that
he
might
do
wrong
and
not
be
punished,
He
believed
that
the
shortest
way
to
accomplish
what
he
desired
was
perjury
and
lying
and
deceit,
but
simplicity
and
truth
were
just
foolishness.
It
was
clear
that
he
had
affection
for
no-one,
but
he
obviously
plotted
against
any
he
called
friend.
He
never
laughed
at
an
enemy,
but
he
always
talked
as
though
he
was
laughing
at
all
his
associates.
He
had
no
designs
against
the
possessions
of
his
enemies,
for
he
thought
it
was
difficult
to
get
hold
of
things
well
guarded;
but
he
believed
he
was
the
sole
discoverer
how
easy
it
is
to
get
hold
of
the
unprotected,
that
is,
what
his
friends
had.
If
he
found
out
that
any
were
perjured
and
dishonest,
he
feared
them
as
being
well
armed;
but
pious
men,
and
those
who
practised
truth,
he
tried
to
use
as
being
cowards.
As
others
pride
themselves
on
godliness
and
truth
and
honesty,
so
Menon
prided
himself
on
his
power
to
deceive,
to
fabricate
falsehoods,
to
mock
at
his
friends.
If
a
man
was
not
unscrupulous
he
always
thought
him
one
of
the
uneducated.
If
he
wanted
to
make
himself
first
in
the
friendship
of
any,
he
thought
it
should
be
done
by
slandering
those
who
were
first.
To
make
his
soldiers
obedient,
his
principle
was
to
share
in
their
misdeeds;
he
expected
to
be
honoured
and
courted
if
he
showed
that
he
would
and
could
do
most
in
that
line.
If
ever
anyone
held
aloof,
he
called
it
a
real
kindness
that
he
had
not
destroyed
him
while
they
were
friends,
There
are
indeed
certain
obscure
charges
against
him
which
may
not
be
true,
but
here
are
some
things
which
everyone
knows.
He
was
in
the
bloom
of
his
youth
when
he
got
command
of
the
mercenaries
from
Aristippos;
he
became
very
intimate
with
Ariaios,
who
was
a
barbarian,
because
the
man
liked
handsome
lads;
he
himself,
while
yet
beardless,
had
a
bearded
favourite
in
Tharypas.
When
his
fale
aesene
were
put
to
death
for
marching
with
Cyros
against
the
king,
he
was
not
put
to
death
although
he
had
done
the
same;
but
after
the
death
of
the
others
he
was
punished
with
death
by
the
king,
not
beheaded
like
Clearchos
and
the
rest.
which
is
thought
to
be
the
quickest
death,
but
it
is
said
kept
alive
for
a
year
and
tortured
until
he
died
the
death
of
a
malefactor.
Agias
the
Arcadian
and
Socrates
the
Achaian
were
also
put
to
death,
No-one
had
a
bad
word
to
say
of
these,
either
as
soldiers
or
as
friends.
Both
were
about
five-and-thirty
years
of
age.
BOOK
THREE
3.1
After
the
captains
had
been
seized,
and
the
officers
and
men
who
were
their
escort
had
been
cut
down,
the
Hellenes
were
in
despair,
full
of
anxiety.
There
they
were
at
the
king’s
door,
and
round
them
everywhere
so
many
nations
and
cities
of
the
enemy.
No-one
now
would
provide
them
a
market;
they
were
distant
from
Hellas
more
than
a
thousand
miles,
with
no
guide
for
the
road.
Impassable
rivers
crossed
the
homeward
way,
and
they
had
been
deserted
even
by
the
natives
who
had
come
up
country
with
Cyros.
They
were
left
alone
without
one
single
horseman
to
help
them,
so
that
it
was
clear
that
if
they
were
victorious
they
could
kill
no-one,
and
if
they
were
worsted
not
one
of
them
would
be
left.
These
thoughts
passed
through
their
minds
and
made
them
spiritless.
Few
of
them
tasted
food
that
evening,
few
lit
a
fire;
many
of
them
never
came
into
camp
that
night,
but
they
rested
each
where
he
chanced
to
be.
They
could
not
sleep
for
sorrow,
longing
for
home
and
parents,
for
wives
and
children,
which
they
never
expected
to
see
again.
In
this
state
they
all
tried
to
rest.
There
was
in
the
army
an
Athenian,
Xenophon,
who
came
with
them
neither
as
captain
nor
officer
nor
man,
but
Proxenos
had
invited
him
to
come,
being
an
old
family
friend.
Proxenos
promised,
if
he
would
come,
to
introduce
him
to
Cyros,
who
was,
he
said,
more
than
home
and
country
to
himself.
Xenophon
read
his
letter,
and
consulted
Socrates
the
philosopher
about
this
trip.
Socrates
had
a
suspicion
that
there
might
be
some
state
objection
to
his
being
friendly
with
Cyros,
because
Cyros
had
favoured
the
Lacedaimonians
in
their
war
against
Athens;
so
he
advised
Xenophon
to
go
to
Delphi
and
inquire
of
the
oracle
about
this
journey.
Accordingly
Xenophon
went
and
asked
Apollo
what
god
he
should
sacrifice
and
pray
to,
that
he
might
best
accomplish
the
journey
he
had
in
mind,
and
come
back
safe
and
successful.
Apollo
named
the
gods
to
whom
he
must
sacrifice.
When
he
came
back
he
told
the
oracle
to
Socrates.
But
Socrates
blamed
him
because
he
had
not
asked
first
whether
it
was
better
for
him
to
go
or
to
stay,
but
just
decided
to
go,
and
then
asked
how
he
could
best
do
it.
“But,”
said
he,
“since
you
did
ask
that,
you
must
do
what
the
god
bids.”
So
Xenophon
sacrificed
to
those
gods
as
he
was
directed,
and
set
sail;
and
at
Sardis
he
found
Proxenos
and
Cyros
on
the
point
of
going
up
country,
and
then
he
was
introduced
to
Cyros.
Proxenos
urged
him
to
stay,
and
Cyros
urged
him
too,
and
promised
he
would
send
him
home
as
soon
as
the
campaign
was
over.
The
expedition
was
said
to
be
against
the
Pisidians;
and
so
he
joined
it,
being
thus
deceived—but
not
by
Proxenos,
for
he
did
not
know
of
the
attack
to
be
made
upon
the
king,
nor
did
anyone
else
of
the
Hellenes
except
Clearchos.
However,
when
they
got
as
far
as
Cilicia,
it
seemed
to
be
clear
to
all
that
they
were
marching
against
the
king.
Most
of
them
followed
for
shame
of
one
another
and
Cyros,
although
they
feared
the
journey
and
went
against
their
will;
and
one
of
these
was
Xenophon,
And
now
in
their
desperate
plight,
he
was
unhappy
like
the
rest
and
could
not
sleep;
but
he
did
snatch
a
nap,
and
then
he
saw
a
dream.
He
thought
there
was
lightning
and
a
thunderbolt
fell
on
his
father’s
house,
and
all
was
in
a
blaze.
He
woke
at
once
in
terror;
the
dream
he
judged
to
be
good
in
one
way,
because
amid
troubles
and
dangers
he
seemed
to
see
a
great
light
from
Zeus,
but
in
another
way
he
feared,
because
he
considered
the
dream
to
come
from
Zeus
the
king
and
the
blaze
of
fire
seemed
to
be
all
round,
so
he
feared
difficulties
would
fence
him
in
all
round,
and
he
might
not
be
able
to
get
out
of
the
country
of
the
king.
But
what
such
a
dream
really
means
may
be
seen
from
what
happened
afterwards;
and
this
is
what
happened.
As
soon
as
he
was
awake,
the
first
thought
that
came
into
his
head
was,
“Why
do
I
lie
here?
The
night
is
going
on,
and
with
daylight
it
is
likely
the
enemy
will
come.
If
we
fall
into
the
power
of
the
king,
now
we
must
see
the
most
cruel
sights,
and
feel
the
most
terrible
pains,
and
die
by
violence—and
how
can
it
be
helped?
But
how
are
we
to
defend
ourselves?
No-one
is
preparing
for
that,
no-one
cares
about
that,
but
we
lie
here
as
if
it
were
possible
to
live
in
peace
and
quiet!
What
about
me
then?
What
captain
from
what
country
do
I
expect
to
do
that?
Am
I
waiting
till
I
grow
old
enough
myself—and
how
old?
I
shall
never
be
any
older
at
all,
if
I
give
myself
up
to
the
enemy
to-day.”
Then
he
got
up,
and
first
called
together
the
underofficers
of
Proxenos.
When
they
were
collected
he
said:
“Gentlemen,
I
cannot
sleep
and
I
don’t
think
you
can;
and
I
can’t
lie
here
when
I
see
what
a
plight
we
are
in.
It
is
clear
that
the
enemy
did
not
show
us
open
war
until
they
thought
they
had
everything
well
prepared;
and
noone
among
us
takes
the
pains
to
make
the
best
possible
resistance.
“Yet
if
we
give
way,
and
fall
into
the
king’s
power,
what
do
we
expect
our
fate
will
be?
When
his
own
half-brother
was
dead,
the
man
cut
off
his
head
and
cut
off
his
hand
and
stuck
them
up
on
a
pole.
We
have
no-one
to
plead
for
us,
and
we
marched
here
to
make
the
king
a
slave
or
to
kill
him
if
we
could,
and
what
do
you
think
our
fate
will
be?
Would
he
not
go
to
all
extremes
of
torture
to
make
the
whole
world
afraid
of
making
war
on
him?
Why,
we
must
do
anything
to
keep
out
of
his
power!
While
the
truce
lasted,
I
never
ceased
pitying
ourselves,
I
never
ceased
congratulating
the
king
and
his
army.
What
a
vast
country
I
saw,
how
large,
what
endless
provisions,
what
crowds
of
servants,
how
many
cattle
and
sheep,
what
gold,
what
raiment!
But
when
I
thought
of
these
our
soldiers—we
had
no
share
in
all
these
good
things
unless
we
bought
them,
and
few
had
anything
left
to
buy
with;
and
to
procure
anything
without
buying
was
debarred
by
our
oaths.
While
I
reasoned
like
this,
I
sometimes
feared
the
truce
more
than
the
war
now.
“However,
now
they
have
broken
the
truce,
there
is
an
end
both
to
their
insolence
and
to
our
suspicion.
There
lie
all
these
good
things
before
us,
prizes
for
whichever
side
prove
the
better
men;
the
gods
are
the
judges
of
the
contest,
and
they
will
be
with
us,
naturally.
These
men
are
perjured
before
them,
while
we
saw
so
many
good
things
and
kept
strictly
away
from
them
because
of
our
oaths
sworn
to
the
gods;
therefore
we
may
enter
the
contest,
it
seems
to
me,
with
much
better
hearts
than
they
can.
“Besides,
our
bodies
are
better
fitted
than
theirs
for
bearing
cold
and
heat
and
hardship;
and
our
souls
are
better,
thank
God!
They
are
men
easier
to
wound
and
to
kill
than
we
are
if
the
gods
give
us
victory
as
before.
“Perhaps
others
are
now
thinking
the
same,
but
in
heaven’s
name
don’t
let
us
wait
for
someone
else
to
come
and
pat
us
on
the
back
and
say,
Go
it.
Here’s
a
grand
enterprise!
Let
us
take
the
lead
and
show
the
others
how
to
be
brave!
Show
yourselves
the
best
of
officers,
and
as
worthy
to
be
captains
as
the
captains
themselves!
Count
on
me,
if
you
are
willing
to
make
the
start;
I
will
follow
you,
or
if
you
order
me
to
lead,
I
will
not
make
my
youth
an
excuse,
but
I
think
I
am
old
enough
to
keep
danger
from
myself!”
The
officers
on
hearing
this
address
all
asked
him
to
be
their
leader,
except
a
certain
Apollonides
who
spoke
in
the
Beeotian
dialect.
He
said
it
was
all
nonsense
to
pretend
that
any
safety
could
be
found
except
with
the
king’s
consent,
if
that
could
be
had,
and
at
the
same
time
he
began
to
speak
of
the
difficulties.
But
Xenophon
cut
him
short
and
said:
“Man,
I’m
amazed
at
you!
You
have
eyes
to
see,
but
you
understand
not;
you
have
ears
to
hear,
but
you
remember
not!
You
were
there
with
the
others,
I
think,
when
the
king
was
so
proud
after
the
death
of
Cyros,
and
sent
to
demand
our
arms.
We
refused
to
give
them
up,
but
went
and
encamped
beside
him.
What
didn’t
he
do!
Sent
ambassadors,
asked
for
a
truce,
gave
provisions
till
he
got
it!
And
when
the
captains
and
officers
did
what
you
tell
us
to
do,
and
went
for
a
conference
without
arms,
trusting
to
this
truce—
where
are
they
now?
Beaten,
stabbed,
insulted,
the
poor
devils
can’t
even
die,
though
that
is
what
they
long
for!
And
you
know
all
this,
and
you
say
those
who
urge
resistance
are
talking
nonsense,
and
you
tell
us
to
go
there
again
and
try
persuasion!
In
my
opinion,
men,
we
ought
not
to
let
this
man
be
one
of
us.
We
ought
to
take
his
rank
from
him,
and
put
a
pack
on
his
back,
and
make
him
carry
for
us.
This
man
is
a
disgrace
to
his
own
country
and
to
all
Hellas,
because
he
is
a
Hellene
and
yet
behaves
like
this.”
Then
Agasias
the
Stymphalian
broke
in
and
said:
“But
this
fellow
has
nothing
to
do
at
all
with
Beeotia
or
Hellas;
I
have
noticed
that
both
his
ears
are
bored,
like
a
Lydian’s.”
And
so
they
were;
accordingly
they
drove
him
away.
The
others
went
the
rounds;
wherever
a
captain
was
in
some
post
they
called
him
along,
wherever
there
was
none,
the
second-in-command,
or
where
a
lieutenant
was
left
alive
the
lieutenant.
When
all
were
collected
they
seated
themselves
in
front
of
the
place
of
arms;
they
were
about
one
hundred
captains
and
other
officers.
It
was
about
midnight
now.
Then
Hieronymos
of
Elis,
the
eldest
of
Proxenos’s
officers,
began
to
speak.
He
said:
“Gentlemen,
captains
and
officers
of
our
army,
seeing
the
state
we
are
in
we
thought
it
best
to
meet
and
to
invite
you,
that
we
might
devise
some
good
plan
amongst
us.
I
call
on
you,
Xenophon,
to
speak
as
you
did
to
us.”
Then
Xenophon
said:
“Well,
we
all
know
that
the
king
and
Tissaphernes
have
seized
all
of
us
they
could,
and
it
is
clear
they
are
planning
to
destroy
us
if
they
can.
My
opinion
is
that
we
ought
to
do
anything
and
everything
not
to
fall
into
the
power
of
these
barbarians,
but
turn
the
tables
on
them.
Let
me
point
out
to
you,
then,
that
you
now
here
assembled
have
a
grand
opportunity.
All
these
soldiers
have
their
eyes
on
you.
If
they
see
you
are
discouraged
they
will
all
be
cowards;
but
if
you
show
that
you
are
making
preparations
against
the
enemy,
and
if
you
call
on
them,
you
may
be
sure
they
will
follow
you
and
try
to
imitate
you.
Perhaps
it
is
fair
to
expect
you
to
be
a
bit
better
than
they
are.
You
are
captains,
you
see,
or
you
are
in
command
of
troops
and
companies,
and
while
there
was
peace,
you
had
more
wealth
and
honour;
then
now
when
war
has
come,
we
must
ask
you
to
be
better
than
the
mob,
and
to
plan
and
labour
for
their
behalf,
if
necessary.
“Now,
first
of
all,
I
think
you
will
do
the
whole
army
a
great
service
if
you
take
care
at
once
to
appoint
captains
and
officers
in
the
place
of
those
who
have
been
lost.
For
it
is
true
one
may
say
universally
that
without
commanders
nothing
good
or
useful
could
ever
be
done:
good
discipline
always
saves,
but
disorder
has
destroyed
many.
When
you
have
appointed
as
many
commanders
as
are
wanted,
assemble
all
the
other
soldiers
and
encourage
them;
that
will
be
just
what
they
want
now.
Perhaps
you
have
noticed
yourselves
how
crestfallen
they
were
when
they
came
into
camp,
how
crestfallen
they
went
on
guard;
in
such
a
state
I
don’t
know
what
you
could
do
with
them,
either
by
night
or
by
day.
But
if
someone
could
turn
their
minds
from
wondering
what
will
happen
to
them,
and
make
them
wonder
what
they
could
do,
they
will
be
much
more
cheerful.
You
know,
I
am
sure,
that
not
numbers
or
strength
brings
victory
in
war;
but
whichever
army
goes
into
battle
stronger
in
soul,
their
enemies
generally
cannot
withstand
them.
“I
have
noticed
also
myself,
gentlemen,
that
when
men
seek
for
nothing
in
warfare
but
only
life
at
all
costs,
they
are
generally
the
ones
to
die,
and
that
with
disgrace
and
ignominy;
but
when
they
recognize
that
all
men
must
die,
for
this
is
their
common
lot,
and
strive
only
to
die
with
honour,
these
I
generally
see
growing
to
old
age,
and
while
they
live,
much
happier.
Learn
this
lesson
yourselves,
for
now
is
the
time
we
need
it:
be
men
yourselves,
and
encourage
others
to
do
the
same.”
With
these
words
he
sat
down;
and
after
him
Cheirisophos
rose
and
said:
“All
I
knew
of
you
before,
my
dear
Xenophon,
was
just
that
I
heard
you
were
an
Athenian;
but
now
I
admire
you
for
what
you
say
and
what
you
do,
and
I
wish
there
were
many
more
like
you—that
would
be
a
public
benefit.
And
now,
gentlemen,”
he
went
on,
“don’t
let
us
waste
time;
dismiss
and
choose
commanders,
those
who
need
them,
then
come
back
here
to
the
middle
of
our
camp,
and
bring
the
selected
men.
After
that,
we
will
summon
all
the
troops
to
a
mecting
there.
And
we
must
have
Tolmides
the
herald
there
too.”
As
he
said
this
he
got
up
and
went
to
do
what
was
necessary
without
delay.
Then
officers
were
chosen:
in
place
of
Clearchos,
Timasion
the
Dardanian;
in
place
of
Socrates,
Xanthicles
the
Achaian;
in
place
of
Agias,
Cleanor
the
Arcadian;
in
place
of
Menon,
Philesios
the
Achaian;
in
place
of
Proxenos,
Xenophon
the
Athenian.
3.2
When
these
had
been
elected
it
was
almost
dawn,
and
the
commanders
came
forward.
They
decided
to
set
the
watch
and
to
convene
the
men.
When
the
soldiers
were
all
there,
first
Cheirisophos
the
Lacedaimonian
got
up
and
spoke
as
follows:
“Soldiers,
this
is
a
dangerous
time,
when
we
have
lost
such
captains
and
officers
and
men;
and
besides,
our
former
allies,
Ariaios
and
his
men,
have
betrayed
us.
But
we
must
face
the
dangers,
and
prove
good
men,
and
not
give
in,
but
try
to
save
ourselves
by
a
handsome
victory
if
we
can.
If
not,
at
least
let
us
die
with
honour,
but
let
us
never
fall
into
our
enemies’
hands
alive;
for
I
think
we
should
suffer
such
things
as
the
gods
would
do
to
their
enemies.”
After
him
Cleanor
the
Orchomenian
rose
and
said:
“You
see,
men,
the
king’s
perjury
and
impiety!
You
see
the
treachery
of
Tissaphernes!
He
said
he
was
near
neighbour
to
Hellas,
and
would
do
so
much
to
save
us,
he
swore
solemn
oaths
to
us
himself,
he
gave
us
pledges
himself,
and
then
he
deceived
us
himself—seized
our
captains,
feared
not
the
God
of
Guests,
but
invited
Clearchos
to
sit
at
his
table,
and
then
made
this
very
act
the
means
of
destroying
those
men!
Ariaios
again—we
would
have
made
him
king,
we
gave
and
received
pledges
to
be
true
to
each
other,
but
he
did
not
fear
God.
Cyros
alive
honoured
him
highly,
but
he
had
no
respect
for
Cyros
dead;
now
he
has
deserted
to
the
bitterest
enemies
of
Cyros,
and
tries
to
ruin
the
friends
of
Cyros!
These
men
may
the
gods
punish;
but
we,
seeing
this,
must
not
be
deceived
by
these
men
again.
We
must
fight
our
strongest,
and
leave
our
fate
in
the
hands
of
the
gods.”
Then
Xenophon
rose;
he
was
arrayed
for
war
in
his
finest
dress.
“If
the
gods
grant
victory,”
he
thought,
“the
finest
adornments
are
most
proper
for
such
a
victory;
if
I
must
die,
after
grand
ambitions
I
would
meet
my
end
in
grandeur.”
Then
he
began
as
follows:
“The
perjury
and
treachery
of
the
barbarians
Cleanor
has
spoken
of,
and
I
think
you
know
it
yourselves.
Then
if
we
wish
to
be
friends
with
them
again,
we
must
feel
very
much
disheartened
when
we
see
what
our
captains
have
suffered
when
they
trusted
themselves
to
them
in
good
faith.
But
if
we
have
in
mind
to
punish
them
in
arms
for
what
they
have
done,
and
to
be
henceforth
in
war
with
them
out
and
out,
then
with
God’s
help
there
are
many
good
hopes
of
safety.”
While
he
was
speaking
someone
sneezed
a
good
omen
;
the
soldiers
hearing
this,
kissed
their
hands
to
heaven,
and
Xenophon
said:
“While
we
were
speaking
of
safety
came
an
omen
of
Zeus
the
Saviour!
Then
I
think
we
should
vow
to
this
god
a
thanksgiving
for
salvation
as
soon
as
we
reach
the
first
friendly
country,
and
vow
a
sacrifice
to
the
other
gods
according
to
our
ability.
Whoever
agrees
with
this,
let
him
hold
up
his
hand.”
All
held
up
their
hands.
Then
they
made
their
vow
and
chanted
the
battle-hymn.
After
this
matter
of
piety
was
settled
he
began
again:
“I
am
just
saying
that
we
have
many
good
hopes
of
safety.
Firstly,
we
abide
by
our
solemn
oaths;
but
the
enemy
have
perjured
themselves
and
broken
the
truce
contrary
to
their
oaths.
It
is
reasonable,
then,
that
the
gods
should
be
against
our
enemies
and
should
be
our
own
allies;
and
they
are
able
quickly
to
make
the
great
small,
and
easily
to
save
the
small
in
time
of
danger,
if
it
be
their
pleasure.
Next
I
will
remind
you
of
the
dangers
which
our
ancestors
faced,
and
you
will
see
that
it
is
proper
for
you
to
be
good
men,
and
that
good
men
are
saved
with
the
gods’
help
even
from
great
danger.
“The
Persians
came,
you
know,
with
their
enormous
fleet,
to
wipe
out
Athens;
but
the
Athenians
dared
to
stand
up
to
them
and
conquered
them.
They
had
vowed
to
Artemis
to
sacrifice
as
many
goats
as
they
should
kill
Persians;
but
they
could
not
find
enough,
so
they
resolved
to
sacrifice
every
year
five
hundred,
and
they
do
so
still.
Again
later,
when
Xerxes
collected
that
innumerable
host
against
Hellas,
then
again
our
ancestors
conquered
the
ancestors
of
these
men
by
land
and
sea.
We
can
see
proofs
of
this
in
the
trophies,
but
the
greatest
proof
is
the
freedom
of
those
cities
in
which
you
were
born
and
brought
up;
for
you
revere
no
man
as
master,
but
only
the
gods.
“Such
were
your
ancestors.
I
will
not
say
indeed
that
you
are
not
worthy
of
them.
No,
not
many
days
ago
you
faced
these
their
descendants,
many
times
your
number,
and
conquered
them.
Then
you
did
your
part
well,
in
order
to
make
Cyros
king;
now
that
your
own
life
and
safety
is
at
stake,
I
take
it
you
ought
to
be
much
better
and
much
more
resolute.
Moreover,
you
must
be
more
confident
against
your
enemy.
At
that
time
you
had
no
experience
of
them,
yet
you
dared
to
attack
them
with
the
spirit
of
your
fathers.
Now
you
have
found
by
experience
that
they
will
not
stand
up
to
you
even
if
they
are
many
times
your
number.
Then
why
should
you
fear
them?
And
pray
consider
it
no
great
loss
that
Cyros’s
men
who
stood
by
us
once
have
left
us.
For
they
are
greater
cowards
than
those
whom
you
beat;
at
least
they
took
refuge
with
them
when
they
left
us.
If
people
want
to
be
in
the
front
ranks
of
a
flight,
I
prefer
to
see
them
in
our
enemies’
ranks
rather
than
in
ours.
“If
any
of
you
is
downhearted
because
we
have
no
cavalry
but
the
enemy
have
many,
remember
that
their
ten
thousand
cavalry
are
only
ten
thousand
men.
No-one
ever
died
in
battle
from
the
kick
or
the
bite
of
a
horse;
the
men
make
them
do
whatever
they
do
in
battle.
In
fact,
we
have
a
safer
carrier
than
cavalry;
there
they
hang
on
their
horses
fearing
a
fall
as
well
as
a
foe,
but
we
stand
on
the
ground,
and
we
can
hit
harder
if
anyone
attacks,
and
aim
better.
The
cavalry
have
indeed
one
advantage;
they
can
cut
and
run
more
safely!
“Perhaps
you
feel
bold
enough
about
battle,
but
you
are
anxious
because
Tissaphernes
will
not
guide
us
any
longer
and
the
king
will
not
provide
a
market.
Think
a
moment
whether
it
is
better
to
have
Tissaphernes
for
a
guide,
when
he
is
clearly
planning
mischief
against
us,
or
any
men
we
can
catch
to
make
them
guide
us;
they
know
that
if
they
do
us
wrong,
their
lives
and
bodies
are
at
stake.
And
provisions:
is
it
better
to
buy
from
the
market
which
those
men
provided,
small
measure
for
big
price,
when
we
have
not
even
the
price
now;
or
to
take
it
ourselves
if
we
beat
them,
with
any
measure
we
like?
“Perhaps
you
recognize
we
are
better
off
as
it
is,
but
think
the
rivers
an
impassable
obstacle;
you
consider
you
have
been
badly
deceived
when
you
crossed
them.
But
think
whether
this
is
not
really
the
most
foolish
thing
which
the
barbarians
have
done.
All
rivers
are
passable
when
you
come
near
the
source,
hardly
knee-deep,
although
they
may
be
impassable
far
down.
But
assume
that
the
rivers
will
not
let
us
across
and
no
guide
can
be
found,
even
so
we
must
not
lose
heart.
Look
at
the
Mysians;
we
should
not
say
they
are
better
than
we
are,
but
we
know
there
are
many
large
and
prosperous
cities
full
of
them,
in
the
king’s
country,
without
his
leave.
We
know
the
same
of
Pisidians,
and
we
have
seen
ourselves
that
Lycaonians
have
seized
the
strong
places
in
the
plains
and
reap
his
country.
So
with
us:
I
think
we
ought
not
to
show
that
we
have
set
out
for
home,
but
make
preparations
to
live
here.
I
know
quite
well
that
the
king
would
give
plenty
of
guides
to
the
Mysians,
and
hostages
for
honest
dealing,
and
he
would
make
roads
for
them
even
if
they
wished
to
depart
in
four-horse
chariots.
Be
sure
he
would
think
himself
thrice
blessed
to
do
it
for
us,
if
he
saw
us
preparing
to
settle
down!
But
I
am
afraid
that
if
we
once
learn
to
live
idle
in
luxury,
and
to
dally
with
the
fine
big
women
and
girls
of
the
Medes
and
Persians,
we
may
be
like
the
lotus-eaters
and
forget
the
way
home!
“I
think,
then,
that
we
must
first
try
to
reach
Hellas
and
our
own
people,
and
show
the
Hellenes
that
they
are
poor
only
because
they
want
to
be,
when
they
could
bring
their
paupers
over
here
and
see
them
rich.
But
don’t
forget,
men,
that
all
these
good
things
belong
to
the
conquerors;
and
now
it
is
necessary
to
say
how
we
can
travel
most
safely
and
fight
most
successfully.
“First
of
all,
then,
I
propose
that
we
burn
the
wagons
we
have,
that
the
baggage-train
may
not
be
our
captain,
and
we
may
go
where
is
best
for
the
army.
Next,
burn
the
tents
too:
for
these
are
a
nuisance
to
carry,
they
don’t
help
us
to
fight
or
to
find
provisions.
Further,
let
us
get
rid
of
superfluous
baggage,
keeping
only
what
we
need
for
battle
or
eating
or
drinking;
so
the
greatest
number
of
us
will
be
under
arms,
and
as
few
as
possible
carrying
baggage.
You
know,
of
course,
that
if
we
are
beaten,
someone
else
owns
all
our
goods;
if
we
win,
we
may
call
the
enemy
our
porters.
“It
remains
to
say
what
I
think
is
the
chief
thing
of
all.
You
see
that
the
enemy
dared
not
make
war
upon
us
until
they
had
seized
our
leaders.
They
believed
that
while
the
commanders
were
there,
and
while
we
obeyed,
we
were
able
to
defeat
them;
when
they
took
our
commanders,
they
thought
we
should
be
destroyed
by
anarchy
and
disorder.
Very
well:
the
commanders
must
be
much
more
careful
than
before,
and
the
commanded
must
be
more
obedient
than
before:
and
if
anyone
disobeys,
we
must
vote
that
each
and
all
of
you
must
help
the
commander
to
punish.
So
the
enemy
will
find
themselves
mightily
mistaken:
for
this
day
they
will
see
ten
thousand
Clearchoses
instead
of
one,
who
will
never
permit
anyone
to
be
a
coward.
“But
now
it
is
high
time
for
me
to
finish;
perhaps
the
enemy
will
be
here
soon.
Then
let
those
who
think
I
am
right
support
me
at
once,
that
my
proposals
may
be
carried
out.
Or
if
anyone
has
anything
better,
let
him
speak
up
boldly
and
say
so,
even
if
he
is
a
private
soldier,
for
our
common
safety
is
our
common
need.”
After
this
Cheirisophos
said,
“If
we
need
anything
else,
beside
what
Xenophon
says,
we
can
do
it
by
and
by;
but
I
think
it
best
to
carry
these
proposals
at
once.
Whoever
agrees,
let
him
hold
up
a
hand.”
All
held
up
their
hands.
Then
Xenophon
rose
again
and
said,
“Men,
listen
to
something
else
I
have
to
propose.
It
is
clear
that
we
must
march
where
we
can
find
provisions,
and
I
hear
there
are
good
villages
not
more
than
ten
miles
away.
Then
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
the
enemy
follow
us
when
we
go,
as
cowardly
dogs
chase
and
bite
those
who
pass,
if
they
can,
but
run
away
if
they
pursue.
Then
it
is
safe
perhaps
to
march
in
a
hollow
square,
with
the
armed
men
outside
and
the
baggage
and
crowd
of
camp
followers
safer
in
the
middle.
Suppose
we
decide
who
is
to
lead
the
square,
and
keep
order
in
front,
and
who
is
to
be
on
the
flanks,
and
who
to
bring
up
the
rear,
we
shall
not
have
to
consider
when
the
enemy
come,
but
we
can
just
use
the
arrangements.
If
anyone
sees
anything
better,
let
us
do
as
he
says:
otherwise
let
Cheirisophos
lead
the
van,
since
he
is
a
Lacedaimonian,
and
the
two
eldest
captains
see
to
the
flanks;
while
the
youngest,
I
and
Timasion,
will
take
the
rear
for
the
present.
We
will
just
try
this
arrangement,
and
for
the
future
we
can
do
as
may
seem
best.
If
anyone
has
a
better
plan,
let
him
speak.”
As
no-one
spoke,
he
said,
“Those
in
favour,
hold
up
a
hand.”
All
agreed.
“Now
then,”
he
said,
“dismiss
and
do
it
as
agreed.
And
if
any
of
you
wants
to
see
his
dear
ones
again,
let
him
remember
to
be
a
true
man,
for
that’s
the
only
way
to
do
it.
Whoever
wants
to
live,
let
him
try
to
conquer,
for
the
conquerors
kill
and
the
conquered
die.
If
anyone
wants
riches,
let
him
try
to
win;
for
conquerors
preserve
their
own
and
take
the
goods
of
the
conquered.”
3.3
After
these
harangues,
they
went
and
burnt
the
wagons
and
tents;
superfluous
things
they
gave
to
any
who
wanted
them,
and
threw
the
rest
into
the
fire.
This
done,
they
took
breakfast.
While
they
were
at
breakfast,
up
came
Mithradates
with
about
thirty
horsemen,
and,
calling
the
captains
within
hearing,
he
spoke
as
follows:
“I
was
faithful
to
Cyros,
as
you
know,
Hellenes,
and
now
I
am
friendly
to
you;
indeed
I
spend
my
days
here
in
great
fear.
So
if
I
saw
that
you
had
some
profitable
plan
for
safety.
I
would
join
you
with
all
my
servants.
Tell
me,
then,
ae
you
have
in
mind,
and
regard
me
as
a
friend
and
wellwisher,
willing
to
make
my
journey
along
with
you.”
The
captains
consulted,
and
decided
to
answer
this,
with
Cheirisophos
as
spokesman:
“We
are
resolved
to
pass
through
the
country
doing
as
little
damage
as
possible,
if
we
are
left
alone;
but
if
anyone
tries
to
hinder
our
aes
we
will
fight
him
as
stoutly
as
we
can.”
After
this
Mithradates
tried
to
show
them
that
it
was
impossible
to
save
their
lives
except
with
the
king’s
consent.
Then
it
became
clear
that
he
was
a
spy;
for
one
of
the
relations
of
Tissaphernes
was
there
to
keep
him
loyal.
After
this
the
captains
thought
it
best
to
proclaim
war
without
parley
for
as
long
as
they
were
in
the
enemy
country;
for
they
used
to
come
and
try
to
corrupt
the
soldiers,
and
they
did
corrupt
one
officer
Nicarchos
the
Arcadian,
who
deserted
at
night
with
about
twenty
men.
After
this,
they
breakfasted
and
crossed
the
Zapatas
River;
then
began
their
march
in
order,
with
baggage
and
mob
in
the
middle.
They
had
not
gone
very
far
when
Mithradates
appeared
again
with
some
two
hundred
horsemen
and
bowmen
and
slingers,
four
hundred
or
so,
very
light
and
trim.
He
came
towards
them
in
friendly
fashion,
but
when
they
were
near
suddenly
there
were
arrows
from
both
horse
and
foot,
and
the
slingers
too
wounded
many.
The
Hellenic
rearguard
suffered
severely
but
could
do
nothing
in
return:
for
the
range
of
the
Cretan
bowmen
was
less
than
the
Persian,
and
besides
being
bare
they
had
to
be
inside
the
defences,
and
the
slingers
were
beyond
the
range
of
their
javelins.
So
Xenophon
ordered
pursuit,
and
the
men-at-arms
and
targeteers
of
his
rearguard
did
pursue,
but
they
caught
none
of
the
enemy.
For
the
Hellenes
had
no
horsemen,
and
the
footmen
could
not
catch
the
enemy
footmen
with
a
long
start
in
a
short
run;
of
course
they
could
not
go
far
from
the
army,
and
the
barbarian
horsemen
shot
arrows
behind
them
as
they
rode
and
hit
them,
besides
they
had
to
come
back
all
that
way
fighting.
The
result
was
that
they
made
no
more
than
three
miles
or
so
in
all
that
day,
but
towards
evening
they
reached
the
villages.
Then
again
there
was
great
discouragement.
Cheirisophos
and
the
older
captains
blamed
Xenophon
because
he
left
the
lines
to
pursue,
and
risked
himself
but
could
do
no
harm
to
the
enemy.
Xenophon
listened,
and
said
they
were
quite
right
in
blaming
him,
as
the
result
had
showed.
“But
I
was
compelled
to
pursue,”
he
said,
“when
I
saw
that
we
suffered
so
badly
by
standing
still
and
we
could
do
nothing
in
return.
When
we
did
pursue,
what
you
say
is
the
truth,”
says
he;
“we
could
do
them
no
damage,
and
got
back
with
great
difficulty.
Thank
God
they
had
only
a
small
force,
so
they
could
not
hurt
us
seriously,
but
they
showed
us
what
we
want.
Their
arrows
and
slings
have
such
a
range
that
the
Cretans
cannot
reach
them,
nor
those
who
throw
by
hand;
and
when
we
pursue,
it
is
impossible
to
go
far
from
our
army,
and
in
a
short
space
not
even
a
fast
runner
could
catch
a
runner
with
a
bowshot
start.
Well,
then,
if
we
are
to
keep
them
from
damaging
us
on
the
march,
we
must
find
slingers
and
horsemen
at
once.
I
hear
there
are
Rhodians
in
the
army,
and
most
of
them
know
how
to
sling,
as
they
say,
and
their
shot
has
twice
the
range
of
the
Persians.
The
Persians
use
a
stone
as
big
as
your
fist,
and
so
they
cannot
throw
far,
but
the
Rhodians
know
how
to
use
leaden
bullets.
If
we
can
discover,
then,
which
of
them
possess
a
sling
and
pay
them
extra
for
this,
and
pay
for
plaiting
more
slings,
and
invent
some
other
privilege
for
those
willing
to
be
posted
as
slingers,
perhaps
we
shall
find
some
useful
men.
I
see
also
that
there
are
horses
with
us;
I
have
some
myself,
some
were
left
by
Clearchos,
many
others
which
we
captured
are
carrying
baggage.
If
we
take
the
pick
of
these,
and
put
other
animals
to
carry,
we
can
use
the
horses
for
cavalry,
and
perhaps
these
will
do
damage
in
the
pursuit.”
This
was
agreed
to;
and
that
night
about
200
slingers
were
found
up,
and
the
next
day
some
50
horses
and
horsemen
were
passed
as
fitting,
and
buff
jackets
and
corselets
were
provided
for
them,
and
Lycios
the
Athenian,
Polystratos’
son,
was
put
in
command
of
the
horse.
3.4
They
stayed
there
that
day,
and
on
the
next
began
the
march
earlier
than
usual,
for
they
had
to
pass
through
a
ravine
where
they
feared
the
enemy
might
attack
them
in
the
pass.
When
they
had
passed,
Mithradates
appeared
again
with
1,000
cavalry
and
some
4,000
bowmen
and
slingers.
He
had
demanded
so
many
from
Tissaphernes,
and
promised
that
if
he
got
them
he
would
deliver
the
Hellenes
into
his
hand:
he
despised
them
because
in
the
former
attack
with
a
small
force
he
had
done
much
damage,
as
he
thought,
and
suffered
nothing
at
all.
When
the
Hellenes
had
gone
about
a
mile
from
the
pass,
Mithradates
came
through
with
his
force.
Orders
had
been
given
which
of
the
targeteers
and
men-at-arms
were
to
pursue,
and
the
horsemen
were
told
to
pursue
boldly
and
a
sufficient
force
would
follow.
So
when
Mithradates
caught
them
up,
and
arrows
and
slingstones
began
to
come,
a
trumpet
sounded
for
the
Hellenes,
and
the
appointed
parties
doubled
out
at
once
and
the
horsemen
galloped;
the
enemy
did
not
wait
for
them
but
ran
back
into
the
ravine.
In
this
pursuit,
many
of
the
barbarians
were
killed,
and
some
of
the
cavalry
were
taken
alive,
about
eighteen.
The
dead
bodies
were
mutilated
by
the
Hellenes
unbidden,
to
strike
terror
into
the
enemy.
They
only
imitated
the
Persian
custom.
But
the
enemy
retired
after
this,
and
the
Hellenes
marched
unmolested
the
rest
of
the
day
as
far
as
the
River
Tigris.
A
large
deserted
city
was
there,
named
Larisa,
modern
Nimrud
which
had
once
been
inhabited
by
Medes.
The
wall
of
this
place
was
five-and-twenty
feet
thick,
and
one
hundred
high,
the
whole
being
two
leagues
round.
It
was
built
of
clay
bricks,
on
a
stone
base
twenty
feet
high.
When
the
Persians
took
the
empire
from
the
Medes
the
Persian
king
besieged
this
place
and
could
not
take
it
in
any
way;
then
a
cloud
covered
the
sun
and
hid
it
until
the
people
escaped,
and
so
it
was
taken.
Near
this
city
was
a
stone
pyramid,
one
hundred
feet
wide
and
two
hundred
high.
On
this
pyramid
were
many
of
the
natives
who
had
escaped
from
the
villages
near.
From
this
place
they
marched
one
stage,
6
leagues,
to
a
large
deserted
fortress
named
Mespila,
Calah,
or
Nineveh.
The
first
Cyros
took
it
in
558
B.c.
formerly
inhabited
by
Medes.
The
foundation
was
made
of
polished
stone
full
of
shells,
fifty
feet
wide
and
fifty
high;
the
circuit
was
6
leagues.
There
the
king’s
wife
Medeia
wife
of
Astyages,
the
last
King
of
Media
is
said
to
have
taken
refuge
when
the
Medes
lost
their
empire
to
the
Persians.
The
Persian
king
besieged
this
place,
but
could
not
take
it
either
by
time
or
by
force;
but
Zeus
affrighted
the
inhabitants
by
thunder,
and
so
it
was
taken.
From
this
place
they
marched
one
stage,
4
leagues.
On
this
stage
Tissaphernes
appeared,
with
his
own
cavalry
and
the
forces
of
Orontas,
who
married
the
king’s
daughter,
and
the
nationals
whom
Cyros
had
brought
up
country
with
him,
and
those
whom
the
king’s
brothers
had
brought
to
support
the
king;
it
so
appeared
to
be
an
immense
army.
When
he
was
near
he
stationed
some
ranks
in
the
rear,
and
led
others
along
the
flanks,
but
he
dared
not
attack
and
he
wished
to
run
no
risk,
only
gave
orders
to
shoot
with
bow
and
sling.
But
the
Rhodians
posted
here
and
there
slung
their
bullets
and
the
bowmen
shot
their
arrows,
and
not
one
missed
a
man
(he
would
have
found
it
hard
to
miss
if
he
had
tried);
so
Tissaphernes
quickly
retreated
out
of
range,
and
the
other
ranks
retreated
too.
For
the
rest
of
the
day
they
went
on
marching,
and
the
barbarians
did
no
harm
by
their
sharpshooting;
for
the
Rhodians
had
longer
range
than
the
Persians,
even
the
bowmen.
The
Persian
bows
are
very
large;
so
the
arrows
they
picked
up
were
useful
to
the
Cretans,
who
practised
with
them,
shooting
high
and
as
far
as
possible.
Plenty
of
gut
was
found
in
the
villages,
and
lead,
which
they
used
for
the
slings.
So
on
this
day,
after
the
Hellenes
had
encamped
in
villages
which
they
found,
the
barbarians
had
the
worst
of
that
skirmish,
and
retreated.
The
day
following
the
Hellenes
spent
in
the
villages
collecting
provisions,
for
there
was
plenty
of
corn
there.
Next
day
they
marched
on
over
the
plain,
and
Tissaphernes
followed,
skirmishing.
Now
the
Hellenes
discovered
that
the
square
was
a
bad
formation
with
the
enemy
following.
If
the
wings
of
the
square
draw
together
when
the
road
is
narrow,
or
where
the
hills
make
it
necessary,
or
a
bridge,
the
armed
men
must
be
greatly
distressed
and
march
badly;
they
are
squeezed
up
and
dis-
ordered
at
the
same
time,
so
they
are
not
easy
to
manage
because
they
lose
discipline.
Again,
when
the
wings
open
again
after
their
late
distress,
the
ranks
must
be
separated
again,
and
there
are
empty
spaces
between,
and
all
are
discouraged
with
an
enemy
behind.
Or
if
they
have
to
cross
a
bridge
or
some
other
crossing,
each
man
tries
to
get
over
first,
and
then
it
is
easy
for
the
enemy
to
attack.
When
the
commanders
perceived
this
they
made
six
companies
of
a
hundred
men
each,
and
appointed
a
lieutenant
to
command
each,
and
officers
for
each
half-company
and
quarter-company.
These
were
taken
from
the
front
or
rear
rank
of
the
square,
which
had
to
be
shortened.
When
the
wings
drew
in
on
the
march
these
companies
fell
to
the
rear
so
as
not
to
confuse
the
wings,
and
they
lined
up
outside
the
wings.
When
the
wings
expanded
again
they
filled
up
the
gap
in
the
line
between,
in
line
of
companies
in
column
if
narrow,
half-companies
if
wider,
quarter-companies
very
wide,
and
so
the
gap
was
always
filled.
Thus
they
were
not
disordered
if
they
had
to
cross
a
ford
or
a
bridge,
but
the
companies
crossed
in
turn;
and
when
they
needed
the
line
these
were
ready.
In
this
way
they
marched
four
stages.
While
they
were
in
the
fifth
they
saw
a
palace
and
many
villages
round
it,
but
the
road
to
this
led
amongst
high
foothills
rolling
down
from
the
mountains
under
which
the
village
lay.
The
Hellenes
were
glad
indeed
to
see
these
mounds,
which
was
natural
when
the
enemy
were
cavalry.
By
and
by
they
left
the
plain
and
went
up
and
down
the
first
mound;
then
as
they
were
about
to
go
up
the
second
there
were
the
barbarians
volleying
down
the
slope
from
the
top
javelins,
slingstones,
and
arrows,
and
the
masters
could
be
seen
flogging
on
the
men!
They
wounded
many,
and
defeated
the
Hellenic
light-armed
men,
and
shut
them
up
in
the
square,
so
that
slingers
and
bowmen
were
both
quite
useless
among
the
mob
all
that
day.
So
the
Hellenes
had
a
hard
time
of
it;
but
when
they
tried
to
pursue
they
could
scarcely
get
to
the
top
in
their
heavy
arms,
but
the
enemy
quickly
leaped
away.
When
they
retired
to
the
main
army
the
same
things
happened;
and
on
the
second
mound
the
same
again,
so
that
they
decided
not
to
move
the
soldiers
from
the
third
mound
until
they
had
sent
a
party
of
light
infantry
from
the
right
wing
up
the
mountains.
As
soon
as
these
were
posted
above
the
pursuing
enemy,
the
enemy
no
longer
attacked
the
descending
troops
for
fear
they
should
be
cut
off
and
find
enemies
on
both
sides.
So
they
proceeded
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
the
army
on
the
road
moving
over
the
foot-hills,
the
others
going
parallel
on
the
mountain-side,
until
they
reached
the
villages.
They
put
eight
surgeons
in
charge,
for
the
wounded
were
many.
They
stayed
there
three
days,
partly
for
the
sake
of
the
wounded,
partly
because
there
was
plenty
of
food,
wheatmeal,
wine,
barley
collected
for
horses
in
great
quantity.
These
had
been
stored
up
for
the
regent
of
the
country.
On
the
fourth
day
they
came
down
into
the
plain.
When
they
came
upon
Tissaphernes
with
his
forces,
experience
taught
them
to
encamp
at
the
first
village
they
saw
and
not
to
march
fighting
all
the
while;
for
there
were
large
numbers
unable
to
fight,
the
wounded
men
and
their
bearers,
and
those
who
carried
the
arms
of
the
bearers.
After
they
had
encamped,
when
the
barbarians
began
to
attack
them
by
their
long
shots,
the
Hellenes
had
much
the
best
of
it;
for
there
was
a
great
difference
between
defending
a
fixt
position
and
making
a
running
fight
on
the
march.
When
late
afternoon
came
it
was
time
for
the
enemy
to
depart;
for
they
never
encamped
at
a
less
distance
than
seven
or
eight
miles,
for
fear
that
they
might
be
attacked
in
the
night.
The
Persian
army
is
good
for
nothing
at
night.
Their
horses
are
tied
up,
and
generally
hobbled
as
well,
that
they
may
not
run
away
if
cast
loose;
and
if
there
is
any
disturbance,
the
Persian
has
to
saddle
and
bridle
his
horse,
and
put
on
his
corselet,
and
then
mount—all
difficult
things
at
night
when
there
is
a
disturbance
too.
That
is
why
they
used
to
encamp
far
away
from
the
Hellenes,
When
our
men
noticed
that
they
were
about
to
go
and
the
word
went
round,
the
trumpet
sounded
to
pack
up.
The
enemy
heard
it,
and
for
some
time
they
did
not
set
out,
but
when
it
was
late
go
they
did,
since
they
thought
it
did
not
pay
to
travel
at
night
and
come
into
camp.
As
soon
as
the
Hellenes
saw
they
were
really
off,
they
also
broke
up
camp
and
marched,
and
did
as
much
as
seven
miles.
So
the
distance
between
the
two
armies
was
so
great,
that
next
day
the
enemy
did
not
appear
at
all,
nor
the
day
after;
but
on
the
fourth
day
the
barbarians
had
gone
ahead
by
a
night
march
and
they
seized
a
high
position
above
the
road
by
which
the
Hellenes
had
to
go,
a
mountain
spur
on
the
right,
under
which
was
the
descent
into
the
plain.
When
Cheirisophos
noticed
that
the
hill
had
been
seized
he
called
Xenophon
from
the
rear,
and
ordered
him
to
come
up
in
front
with
the
targeteers.
But
Xenophon
did
not
bring
them,
for
he
saw
Tissaphernes
appear
with
his
whole
army.
He
rode
up
by
himself
and
asked,
“What
is
it?”
The
other
said,
“You
can
see;
the
hill
above
the
descent
has
been
seized,
and
we
cannot
pass
unless
we
dislodge
them.
Why
didn’t
you
bring
the
targeteers?”
He
replied
that
he
did
not
think
it
safe
to
leave
the
rear
undefended
when
the
enemy
were
in
sight
there.
“Well,
at
least,”
said
Cheirisophos,
“it’s
high
time
to
consider
how
we
can
drive
the
fellows
from
that
hill.”
Then
Xenophon
looked
up
at
the
head
of
the
hill
above
their
army,
and
saw
an
approach
from
this
to
the
peak
where
the
enemy
were,
and
he
said,
“The
best
thing
for
us,
Cheirisophos,
is
to
go
for
that
height
at
once.
If
we
seize
it
the
men
over
the
road
can’t
hold
their
position.
You
stay
with
the
army,
if
you
wish,
and
I
shall
be
glad
to
try
that;
or
you
go,
and
I'll
stay.”
“Take
your
choice,”
said
Cheirisophos,
“you
have
my
leave.”
Xenophon
chose
to
go.
“I’m
the
younger,”
he
said,
but
he
asked
for
a
detachment
from
the
van,
because
it
was
a
long
way
to
bring
men
from
the
rear.
So
Cheirisophos
let
him
have
the
light
infantry
from
the
van,
and
took
instead
those
from
the
centre.
He
gave
him
also
the
300
picked
men
that
he
had
himself
in
the
van.
They
set
off
at
full
speed.
As
soon
as
the
enemy
on
the
hill
perceived
their
march
upon
the
height,
they
began
to
race
for
this
same
place.
Then
there
was
a
rare
din,
the
Hellenic
army
cheering
on
their
men,
and
the
army
of
Tissaphernes
cheering
theirs.
Xenophon
rode
by
on
his
horse,
shouting,
“Men,
remember
this
is
a
race
to
Hellas!
To
your
wives
and
children!
One
little
effort
now,
and
we
shall
do
the
rest
of
our
journey
without
a
blow!”
Soteridas
the
Sicyonian
shouted,
“It
isn’t
fair,
Xenophon!
You
ride
on
a
horse,
I’m
tired
out
carrying
this
shield!”
Xenophon,
hearing
this,
jumped
off
the
horse,
and
pushed
the
man
out
of
his
place,
and
took
the
shield
from
him
and
went
as
fast
as
he
could.
He
had
his
corselet
on,
too,
as
it
happened,
so
it
was
misery
for
him.
“Look
sharp!”
he
called
to
the
front,
“Hurry
up!”
to
the
rear,
and
he
could
hardly
keep
up
himself.
The
other
men
whacked
Soteridas,
and
pelted
him,
and
gave
him
plenty
of
hard
words,
till
they
made
him
take
back
his
shield
and
march
too.
Xenophon
mounted
and
rode
on
again,
and
led
them
as
long
as
the
path
allowed,
but
when
it
became
too
rough
he
left
the
horse
and
made
all
haste
on
foot.
So
they
got
to
the
place
first,
before
the
enemy.
3.5
Then
the
barbarians
turned
and
fled
where
they
could,
and
the
Hellenes
occupied
the
height.
The
army
of
Tissaphernes
and
Ariaios
turned
away
and
went
by
another
road,
Cheirisophos
came
down
and
encamped
in
a
village
full
of
good
things.
There
were
many
other
villages
full
of
good
things
along
the
River
Tigris.
In
the
late
afternoon
suddenly
the
enemy
appeared
on
the
plain,
and
they
cut
down
some
Hellenes
who
were
scattered
about
the
plain
plundering;
indeed,
many
herds
of
animals
had
been
caught
while
trying
to
cross
the
river.
There
Tissaphernes’
men
began
to
burn
the
villages,
and
many
of
the
Hellenes
were
downhearted
for
fear
they
might
find
no
places
to
get
provisions
if
the
burning
went
on.
Cheirisophos
had
been
to
the
rescue,
and
he
was
returning
when
Xenophon
came
riding
down
past
the
lines
and
called
out
as
he
met
them,
“There,
men
of
Hellas!
do
you
see
they
admit
that
the
country
is
ours
already?
They
have
done
what
they
made
us
promise
not
to
do
in
their
treaty!
We
were
not
to
burn
the
king’s
country,
and
now
they
are
burning
it
like
a
foreign
country!
Well,
if
they
have
provisions
for
themselves,
they
will
see
us
going
there
too.
Come,
Cheirisophos,”
says
he,
“I
think
we
ought
to
keep
them
from
burning
our
country.”
Cheirisophos
answered,
“No,
I
don’t;
let’s
burn,
too,”
says
he,
“and
so
they
will
stop
sooner.”
When
they
reached
the
camp
most
were
busy
about
the
provisions,
but
the
captains
and
officers
met.
All
was
despondency
now.
On
one
side
were
high
mountains,
on
one
side
a
river
so
deep
that
even
the
spears
could
not
sound
it.
In
this
unhappy
state
a
Rhodian
man
came
up
and
said,
“I
am
ready,
sirs,
to
take
you
across
four
thousand
men
at
a
time,
if
you
provide
me
with
what
I
want
and
pay
me
one
talent.”
“What
do
you
want?”
they
asked.
“Skins
I
want,”
says
he,
“two
thousand
skins.
I
see
plenty
of
sheep
and
goats
and
cattle
and
asses.
Flay
them
and
blow
up
the
skins
and
they
will
easily
give
us
a
crossing.
I
will
ask
you
too
for
the
straps
you
put
round
the
baggage
animals.
I
fasten
the
skins
together
with
these,
I
moor
each
one
by
tying
stones
to
it
and
letting
them
down
into
the
water
like
anchors,
I
carry
them
across
by
the
current
in
a
line
and
make
fast
the
two
ends,
I
throw
wood
on
the
top
and
earth
over
that.
They
will
not
sink,
you
will
see
that
in
a
minute:
every
skin
will
hold
up
two
men.
They
won’t
slip,
the
wood
and
earth
will
save
them.”
The
captains
thought
this
a
pretty
notion,
but
impossible
to
carry
out,
for
there
were
numbers
of
cavalry
on
the
other
side
to
stop
them;
they
would
be
down
on
the
first
lot
and
would
not
let
them
do
anything
at
all.
Then
the
next
day
they
retreated
again
to
the
unburnt
villages,
after
burning
those
they
left;
so
the
enemy
did
not
ride
after
them,
but
watched
them,
and
seemed
to
be
wondering
where
they
would
turn
now
and
what
they
meant
to
do.
Then
most
were
busy
about
the
provisions,
but
the
captains
met
again,
and
collecting
their
captives
questioned
them
about
the
country
round
about,
what
each
district
was.
They
said
that
the
southern
parts
lay
on
the
road
towards
Babylon
and
Media,
by
which
indeed
they
had
come;
towards
the
east
it
led
to
Susa
and
Ecbatana,
where
the
king
is
said
to
spend
the
summer;
across
the
river
to
the
west
it
led
to
Lydia,
to
Ionia;
the
road
through
the
mountains
and
to
the
north
led
to
the
Kurds.
These
they
said
lived
in
the
mountains
and
they
were
warlike;
they
did
not
obey
the
king;
that
once
a
royal
army
had
invaded
them,
112,000
strong,
and
not
a
man
came
back
because
of
the
difficulties
of
the
country.
But
when
there
was
truce
between
them
and
the
governor
in
the
plain,
“we
mix
with
them,”
says
he,
“and
they
mix
with
us.”
After
hearing
this,
the
captains
seated
together
those
who
claimed
to
know
about
each
part,
without
revealing
which
way
they
meant
to
go.
At
last
they
decided
that
they
were
obliged
to
cross
the
mountains
and
get
into
the
country
of
the
Kurds.
For
the
men
said
that
when
they
had
passed
through
this
they
would
reach
Armenia,
a
large
and
rich
country
which
was
the
province
of
Orontas.
Thence
they
said
it
would
be
easy
to
go
wherever
they
wished.
Upon
this
they
offered
sacrifice,
so
as
to
set
out
whenever
it
should
seem
to
be
the
right
time;
for
they
feared
that
the
pass
over
the
mountains
might
have
been
occupied
already.
So
they
sent
round
the
word
that
after
dinner
all
should
pack
up
and
rest,
and
follow
when
the
command
was
given.
BOOK
FOUR
4.1
It
was
about
the
last
watch,
and
enough
of
the
night
was
left
for
them
to
pass
over
the
plain
in
darkness;
then
the
word
was
sent
round,
and
they
rose
up
and
marched,
and
by
daylight
they
had
reached
the
mountains.
Cheirisophos
was
leading
the
army,
with
all
the
light-armed
troops
round
him,
and
Xenophon
with
men-at-arms
of
the
rearguard
followed
without
any
light
troops;
for
there
seemed
no
danger
that
anyone
would
follow
on
the
rear
of
an
army
going
up.
Cheirisophos
reached
the
summit
without
seeing
any
of
the
enemy;
then
he
led
on,
and
each
wave
of
the
army
as
it
rolled
up
followed
into
the
villages
which
lie
in
the
dells
and
corners
of
the
hills.
By
this
time
all
the
Kurds
had
left
their
houses,
with
wives
and
children,
and
fled
into
the
mountains;
but
plenty
of
provisions
were
to
be
had,
and
the
houses
were
provided
with
huge
numbers
of
brass
pots.
But
the
Hellenes
took
none
of
them,
nor
did
they
pursue
the
people.
They
spared
them
in
the
hope
that
the
Kurds
might
let
them
pass
through
the
country
as
friends,
since
they
were
enemies
to
the
king;
only
they
took
all
the
pro-
visions
they
found,
for
they
had
to
do
it.
But
the
Kurds
would
not
listen
to
any
call,
or
do
any
other
friendly
act.
When
the
last
of
the
Hellenes
had
come
down
from
the
summit
into
the
villages,
it
was
already
dark;
so
narrow
was
the
road
that
the
ascent
and
descent
had
taken
the
whole
day.
Then
some
of
the
Kurds
gathered
and
attacked
the
last
lot,
and
killed
some
and
wounded
others
with
stones
and
arrows.
They
were
only
a
few,
for
the
Hellenic
invasion
had
come
as
a
surprise.
But
if
there
had
been
more,
there
was
danger
that
a
large
part
of
the
army
would
have
been
lost.
That
night
they
spent
in
the
open
among
the
villages;
but
the
Kurds
lit
numbers
of
fires
on
the
mountains
all
round
in
sight
of
each
other.
At
dawn
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
Hellenes
met
and
decided
to
take
with
them
only
the
strongest
of
their
baggage-animals,
and
no
more
than
were
necessary;
to
leave
all
the
rest,
and
to
let
go
all
captives
lately
taken
that
were
in
the
army.
Many
animals
and
captives
made
the
pace
slow,
and
many
of
those
in
charge
of
them
were
out
of
the
fight,
and
with
all
these
men
twice
as
much
provision
had
to
be
found
and
carried.
Heralds
were
sent
round
to
cry
these
orders.
When
breakfast
was
over
they
marched
on;
but
the
captains
posted
men
beside
the
road
at
a
narrow
place:
if
they
found
any
of
the
aforesaid
things
not
left
behind
they
took
possession.
The
men
mostly
obeyed,
but
some
did
smuggle
away
a
good-looking
boy
or
woman.
They
marched
so
far
that
day,
sometimes
fighting
and
sometimes
resting;
but
next
day
came
a
heavy
storm,
yet
they
must
go
on
for
want
of
provisions.
Cheirisophos
led
the
way,
Xenophon
guarded
the
rear.
The
enemy
attacked
them
vigorously,
and
in
those
narrow
places
they
came
close
and
shot
arrows
and
slingstones,
so
the
Hellenes
were
compelled
to
go
slow
what
with
chasing
and
coming
back.
Often
Xenophon
sent
word
for
a
halt,
when
the
enemy
attacked
vigorously;
sometimes
Cheirisophos
halted
when
the
word
came,
but
the
last
time
he
would
not
halt—he
went
on
quickly
and
sent
word
to
follow,
so
that
it
was
clear
something
was
up,
but
there
was
no
time
to
go
and
see
why
he
was
in
a
hurry.
So
it
became
very
much
like
a
flight
for
the
rearguard.
There
died
a
good
man,
Leonymos,
a
Laconian,
shot
with
an
arrow
through
shield
and
corselet
into
the
ribs,
and
Basias,
an
Arcadian,
right
through
the
head.
As
soon
as
they
reached
a
halting-place,
Xenophon
went
as
he
was
straight
to
Cheirisophos,
and
reproached
him:
“Why
didn’t
you
halt?
We
were
forced
to
fly
and
fight
at
the
same
time.
And
now
two
fine
fellows
are
dead,
and
we
could
not
take
them
up
and
bury
them!”
Cheirisophos
answered,
“Look
at
the
mountains!”
says
he.
“See!
no
way
up
anywhere:
this
one
way
you
see
steep
too,
and
you
can
see
all
that
mob.
They
have
occupied
the
pass
and
they
won’t
let
us
get
out!
That’s
why
I
made
such
a
hurry
and
would
not
halt.
I
hoped
to
get
there
first
and
seize
the
pass,
and
the
guides
we
have
say
there
is
no
other
way.”
Xenophon
said,
“Well,
I
have
two
captives.
Those
men
were
so
troublesome
that
I
laid
ambush,
which
gave
us
a
minute
to
breathe
also;
we
killed
a
good
few
and
took
care
to
take
some
alive
just
in
order
to
be
guides,
because
they
know
the
country.”
Then
he
brought
up
the
men,
and
questioned
them
separately,
whether
they
knew
any
other
road
than
the
one
they
could
see.
One
said
no,
although
many
terrors
were
applied;
and
since
he
had
nothing
useful
to
say,
he
was
killed
in
sight
of
the
other.
The
second
said
that
the
first
said
he
knew
no
way
because
a
daughter
of
his
was
married
to
a
man
over
there;
but
he
would
take
them
by
a
road
where
even
animals
could
go.
Asked
if
there
were
any
place
ahead
difficult
to
pass,
he
said
there
was
a
height
which
must
be
occupied
first
or
nothing
could
get
by.
Then
it
was
decided
to
call
the
officers
both
of
heavy
and
light
infantry,
to
tell
them
all
this
and
to
ask
if
anyone
were
man
enough
to
volunteer.
From
the
heavy-armed
two
Arcadians
came
forward,
Aristonymos,
a
Methydrian,
and
Agasias,
a
Stymphalian,
while
a
third
in
rivalry,
Callimachos,
a
Parrhasian,
offered
to
lead
volunteers
from
the
whole
army;
“for
I
know,”
says
he,
“many
young
men
will
follow
if
I
lead.”
Then
they
asked
if
any
of
the
light-armed
officers
would
join?
Aristeas,
a
Chian,
came
forward,
one
who
was
often
useful
to
the
army
for
enterprises
of
this
kind.
4.2
It
was
now
late
afternoon,
and
they
ordered
them
to
take
a
bite
and
go.
They
tied
up
the
guide
and
handed
him
over
to
these;
they
arranged
that
if
they
could
occupy
the
height,
they
were
to
guard
it
that
night
and
sound
the
trumpet
at
dawn.
Then
the
party
on
the
height
were
to
attack
the
enemy
who
held
the
pass,
and
they
would
themselves
come
out
with
succour
as
soon
as
they
could.
With
this
arrangement
the
first
party
marched,
about
two
thousand,
in
torrents
of
rain.
Xenophon
led
his
rearguard
towards
the
visible
pass,
to
draw
the
enemy’s
attention
and
to
hide
the
others
if
possible
as
they
moved
round.
The
rearguard
soon
reached
a
ravine
which
they
must
traverse
before
they
came
to
the
steep
part;
and
then
the
barbarians
rolled
down
round
stones
of
all
sizes,
some
as
big
as
a
wagon-load,
which
hit
the
rocks
and
splintered
in
all
directions
like
slingstones—it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
go
near
the
entrance.
Some
officers
baulked
in
this
place
tried
others,
and
this
went
on
till
it
was
dark;
when
they
thought
they
could
not
be
seen,
they
went
away
for
supper,
and
some
of
the
rearguard
had
not
even
had
breakfast.
But
the
enemy
did
not
cease
rolling
the
stones
all
night,
as
they
could
hear
by
the
noise.
The
party
with
the
guide
went
round
and
caught
the
enemy
outpost
sitting
round
the
fire;
these
they
killed
or
chased
away,
and
stayed
there
themselves,
thinking
they
now
held
the
height.
But
they
did
not
hold
it,
for
where
the
guards
had
been
sitting
there
was
a
round
hill
above,
along
which
ran
the
narrow
path.
However,
there
was
an
approach
from
this
place
to
the
enemy
who
were
sitting
on
the
visible
road.
Thus
they
spent
the
night;
and
when
daylight
came
they
formed
up
and
moved
in
silence
towards
the
enemy.
There
was
a
mist,
so
they
were
able
to
come
near
without
being
seen.
When
they
caught
sight
of
each
other,
the
trumpet
sounded,
and
they
rushed
on
the
fellows
cheering;
the
enemy
did
not
stand,
but
left
the
road
and
fled;
few
were
killed,
for
they
went
light.
Cheirisophos
and
his
men
heard
the
trumpet,
and
charged
straight
up
by
the
visible
road;
other
captains
pushed
along
by
pathless
ways
wherever
they
happened
to
be,
getting
up
as
they
could
and
hoisting
each
other
by
their
spears.
These
were
the
first
to
meet
the
men
who
had
occupied
the
height.
Xenophon
with
half
the
rearguard
marched
by
the
road
which
the
party
with
the
guide
had
taken,
for
this
was
quite
easy
for
baggage-animals;
the
other
half
he
posted
behind
the
animals.
On
the
way
they
came
to
a
hill
above
the
road
with
enemy
in
possession,
whom
it
was
necessary
either
to
cut
down
or
else
to
be
separated
themselves
from
the
other
Hellenes.
The
men
could
have
gone
on
above
as
the
others
had
done,
but
the
animals
could
not
pass
by
any
other
way.
Here,
shouting
encouragement
to
each
other,
they
charged
straight
up
the
front
in
company
columns;
they
did
not
surround
it
but
left
a
way
for
the
enemy
to
escape
if
they
wished.
For
a
while
the
savages
fought
them
off
as
well
as
they
could,
with
arrows
and
spears,
but
they
would
not
face
them
and
ran
away
from
the
place.
However,
no
sooner
had
they
passed
this
hill
than
they
saw
another
in
front
occupied,
and
determined
to
attack
this
again.
But
Xenophon
saw
that
if
he
left
the
captured
hill,
the
enemy
might
take
it
again
and
set
on
the
baggage-train
as
it
passed,
and
the
train
was
long
in
that
narrow
path;
so
he
left
in
charge
captains
Cephisodoros
Cephisophon’s
son,
an
Athenian,
and
Amphicrates
Amphidemos’
son,
an
Athenian,
and
Archagoras,
an
exile
from
Argos,
and
himself
marched
with
the
others
to
the
second
hill
and
took
it
in
the
same
way.
After
this
a
third
hill
remained,
the
steepest
of
them
all,
the
one
where
that
outpost
had
been
taken
in
the
night
by
the
volunteers.
But
as
soon
as
they
came
near,
the
savages
left
the
hill
without
a
blow,
which
astonished
them
all
and
made
them
suspect
they
had
left
it
for
fear
of
being
encircled
and
besieged.
But
the
truth
was
they
saw
from
the
height
what
was
happening
behind,
and
all
moved
upon
the
rearguard.
Now
Xenophon
with
the
youngest
men
climbed
the
hill,
and
told
the
others
to
go
on,
that
the
last
companies
might
come
up
with
them,
until
they
could
ground
arms
on
the
level
beside
the
road.
At
this
moment
Archagoras
arrived.
He
was
in
flight,
and
said
that
they
had
been
dislodged
from
the
first
hill,
and
that
Cephisodoros
and
Amphicrates
were
dead,
with
all
the
others
who
had
not
jumped
down
from
the
rocks
and
got
back
to
the
rearguard.
After
this
feat
the
natives
came
to
a
ridge
opposite
to
the
hill,
and
Xenophon
spoke
to
them
through
an
interpreter
about
a
truce,
and
asked
for
the
dead.
They
promised
to
give
these
back
on
condition
that
they
would
not
burn
the
houses.
Xenophon
agreed
to
this.
While
they
were
parleying,
and
the
rest
of
the
army
was
passing,
all
the
people
of
the
place
had
been
collecting;
and
as
soon
as
they
began
to
descend
from
the
hill
to
join
the
others
where
they
were
halted,
the
enemy
charged
at
once
in
great
force
with
loud
shouts,
and
when
they
were
on
the
top
of
the
hill
which
Xenophon
had
left,
they
rolled
down
rocks.
One
man’s
leg
was
broken,
and
Xenophon
was
deserted
by
the
man
who
carried
his
shield;
but
Eurylochos
of
Lusia,
one
of
the
heavy-armed
men,
ran
up
to
him
and
covered
both
with
one
shield,
so
they
retreated,
and
the
others
joined
the
main
body.
After
this
the
whole
Hellenic
army
united,
and
they
encamped
there
in
luxury;
there
were
fine
houses
in
plenty,
and
wine
so
plentiful
that
it
was
kept
in
cisterns
of
cement.
Xenophon
and
Cheirisophos
arranged
to
give
up
the
guide
in
return
for
the
dead
bodies,
and
they
rendered
to
the
dead
all
the
honours
customary
for
brave
men,
so
far
as
possible.
Next
day
they
marched
without
guide;
but
the
enemy
hindered
their
passage
by
fighting
and
forestalling
them
at
every
narrow
place.
When
they
obstructed
in
front,
Xenophon
marched
out
from
behind
and
made
a
loop
over
the
mountains,
and
tried
to
get
above
them
and
break
the
barrier
in
front;
when
they
attacked
the
rear,
Cheirisophos
marched
out,
and
tried
to
get
above
the
assailants
and
break
the
barrier
behind.
Thus
they
always
looked
after
each
other
and
each
party
supported
the
other.
Sometimes
when
a
party
climbed
a
hill
for
this
purpose
the
natives
made
it
hot
for
them
as
they
came
down
again,
for
they
were
so
light
that
they
could
escape
from
quite
close,
as
they
had
nothing
but
bows
and
slings.
They
were
very
good
bowmen;
they
had
bows
of
nearly
three
cubits,
the
arrows
more
than
two
cubits
long.
When
they
shot
an
arrow,
they
pressed
the
left
foot
upon
the
lower
part
of
the
bow
as
they
drew
the
string;
the
arrows
went
through
shield
and
corselet.
When
the
Hellenes
could
get
hold
of
any,
they
fitted
thongs
to
them
and
used
them
as
javelins.
In
these
districts
the
Cretans
were
most
useful;
their
commander
was
the
Cretan
Stratocles.
4.3
That
night
again
they
spent
in
the
open,
among
the
villages
lying
above
the
plain
by
the
River
Centritis,
E.
Tigris
width
about
two
hundred
feet,
which
was
the
frontier
between
Armenia
and
the
country
of
the
Kurds.
There
the
Hellenes
had
time
to
breathe,
delighted
to
see
a
plain.
The
river
was
distant
from
the
mountains
nearly
a
mile.
There
they
had
a
happy
night,
with
plenty
to
eat,
talking
and
talking
about
the
struggle
now
past.
For
they
had
spent
seven
days
passing
through
the
Kurds’
country,
fighting
all
the
time,
and
they
had
suffered
worse
things
than
all
the
king
and
Tissaphernes
did
to
them.
They
were
quit
of
all
that,
they
thought,
and
fell
happily
asleep.
At
daybreak
they
saw
horsemen
somewhere
across
the
river,
armed
and
prepared
to
oppose
a
crossing,
and
footmen
on
the
banks,
marshalled
above
the
horsemen,
to
hinder
them
from
landing
in
Armenia.
These
were
mercenaries
of
Orontas
and
Artuchas,
Armenian
and
Mardian
and
Chaldean.
The
Chaldzans
were
said
to
be
free
men
and
strong;
they
were
armed
with
long
wicker-work
shields
and
lances.
The
banks
where
these
ranks
were
standing
were
three
or
four
furlongs
away
from
the
river;
one
road
was
in
sight,
leading
upwards,
apparently
a
regular
highway.
The
Hellenes
tried
to
cross
by
this
road,
but
when
they
tried
the
water
came
over
the
breast,
and
the
river-bed
was
rough
with
large
slippery
stones.
They
could
not
go
through
the
water
in
arms,
or
else
the
river
carried
them
off;
they
could
not
carry
the
arms
on
their
heads,
or
they
were
bare
against
arrows
and
other
missiles.
So
they
retreated,
and
encamped
by
the
riverside.
And
where
they
had
spent
the
last
night
themselves
on
the
mountain,
they
saw
the
Kurds
assembled,
armed,
in
large
numbers.
Then
the
Hellenes
were
very
despondent
when
they
saw
how
difficult
it
was
to
cross
the
river,
and
when
they
saw
troops
ready
to
resist,
when
they
saw
the
Kurds
behind
ready
to
fall
on
them
while
they
crossed.
So
they
stayed
there
in
great
despondency
that
day
and
night.
But
Xenophon
saw
a
dream.
He
thought
he
was
fastened
in
irons,
and
the
fetters
dropt
off
of
themselves,
so
that
he
was
free,
and
able
to
straddle
as
wide
as
he
liked.
In
the
early
morning
he
went
and
told
Cheirisophos
that
he
had
hopes
all
would
be
well,
and
described
his
dream.
Cheirisophos
was
glad,
and
as
soon
as
the
light
of
dawn
came
the
captains
made
sacrifice,
all
being
present;
and
the
omens
were
favourable
even
in
the
very
first
victim.
Leaving
the
sacrifice,
the
captains
and
officers
sent
round
word
for
the
army
to
breakfast.
While
Xenophon
sat
at
breakfast,
two
young
men
ran
up;
for
all
knew
that
anyone
might
come
to
him,
at
breakfast
or
supper,
or
if
he
slept,
could
awake
him,
and
tell
anything
he
had
to
propose
for
the
war.
They
told
him,
then,
that
they
had
been
gathering
firewood,
and
they
saw
opposite,
among
some
rocks
which
came
down
to
the
river,
an
old
man
with
a
woman
and
girls
laying
something
like
bags
of
clothes
in
a
cave
in
the
rock,
As
they
watched
they
thought
it
was
a
safe
place
to
cross;
at
least
enemy
horsemen
could
not
come
near
that
place.
So
they
stript
and
went
in
naked
holding
their
knives,
expecting
to
swim
for
it;
but
they
simply
marched
on
and
crossed
and
never
wetted
their
middle;
then
they
took
the
clothes
and
came
back.
So
Xenophon
poured
a
libation
at
once,
and
told
the
young
men
to
fill
up,
and
to
pray
the
gods
who
had
shown
the
dream
and
the
ford
that
they
might
accomplish
what
remained
with
good
success.
After
this,
he
took
the
young
men
straight
to
Cheirisophos,
and
they
told
their
story.
Cheirisophos
listened,
and
poured
a
libation
himself.
Afterwards
they
sent
round
word
to
pack
up;
then
called
a
meeting
of
the
captains,
and
discussed
how
they
could
best
cross
and
conquer
those
in
front
and
not
be
hurt
by
those
behind.
They
decided
that
Cheirisophos
was
to
lead
across
with
half
the
army,
and
the
other
half
was
to
stay
with
Xenophon,
and
the
baggage-train
to
cross
in
the
middle.
When
all
was
arranged
they
marched;
the
young
men
guided
them,
with
the
river
on
the
left.
It
was
about
half
a
mile
to
the
ford,
and
as
they
marched
the
troops
of
horse
opposite
kept
pace
with
them.
When
they
reached
the
ford
and
the
riverbanks,
they
grounded
arms;
and
first
Cheirisophos
himself
put
a
wreath
on
his
head
and
threw
off
his
cloak,
and
took
up
his
armas,
giving
command
to
the
others
to
do
the
same;
and
he
ordered
the
subalterns
to
lead
their
companions
in
column,
part
on
his
left
and
part
on
his
right.
Meanwhile
the
soothsayers
were
sacrificing
over
the
river;
the
enemy
were
shooting
with
bows
and
slings,
but
they
were
out
of
range.
When
the
omens
were
favourable,
all
the
men
chanted
the
battle-hymn
and
cheered,
and
the
women
all
raised
the
woman’s
hosanna
of
triumph,
for
there
were
many
women
in
the
camp.
Cheirisophos
then
plunged
in
with
his
division;
but
Xenophon
took
the
handiest
men
of
the
rearguard,
and
doubled
back
to
the
passage
on
the
road
which
led
away
into
the
Armenian
mountains,
pretending
that
he
wished
to
cross
there
and
cut
off
the
horsemen
along
the
river.
The
enemy
saw
Cheirisophos
and
his
forces
easily
crossing
the
water,
and
Xenophon
doubling
back,
and
then
fearing
they
might
be
cut
off
they
galloped
away
towards
the
upper
crossing,
but
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
road
they
turned
upwards
towards
the
mountains.
Then
Lycios,
who
commanded
the
division
of
horsemen
in
the
army
of
Cheirisophos,
and
Aischines,
who
commanded
the
light-armed
troops,
followed
the
cavalry
when
they
saw
them
galloping
away;
and
the
soldiers
called
out,
“Don’t
let
them
get
away!
Follow
into
the
mountains!”
However,
Cheirisophos
did
not
pursue
the
cavalry
when
his
crossing
was
made,
but
climbed
the
high
banks
opposite
the
place
to
attack
the
enemy
there
above.
But
these
saw
their
own
cavalry
in
flight,
and
saw
the
men-at-arms
moving
to
attack
them,
and
left
the
higher
ground
above
the
river.
Now
Xenophon
saw
that
all
went
well
across
the
river
and
he
doubled
back
towards
the
crossing
troops;
for
the
Kurds
were
visible
coming
down
from
the
hills
to
attack
the
last
men.
Cheirisophos
already
held
the
upper
parts,
and
Lycios
with
his
little
troop
in
pursuit
caught
the
last
of
their
baggage-train,
and
with
them
a
load
of
fine
dress
and
drinkingcups.
The
last
of
the
Hellenic
baggage-train
and
followers
had
just
crossed,
when
Xenophon
returned
and
took
a
stand
opposite
the
Kurds.
He
ordered
the
captains
to
form
up
their
companies
in
squads,
and
to
deploy
to
the
left
in
line
of
squads,
the
captains
and
subalterns
facing
the
Kurds
with
sergeants
in
the
rear
facing
the
river.
When
the
Kurds
saw
the
rearguard
bare
of
the
campfollowers
and
looking
just
a
handful
of
men,
they
advanced
more
quickly
singing
songs
of
their
own.
But
Cheirisophos,
being
now
in
safety,
sent
back
the
light-armed
troops
and
the
bowmen
and
slingers
to
Xenophon,
and
told
them
to
obey
his
orders.
Xenophon
saw
them
ready
to
cross;
he
sent
a
messenger
with
orders
to
stay
near
the
river
but
not
to
go
in;
but
when
he
began
to
cross
himself,
they
should
enter
the
river
to
meet
him,
on
the
left
and
right,
as
if
to
cross,
with
javelins
on
the
thong
and
arrows
on
the
string,
but
they
were
not
to
go
far
into
the
river.
To
his
own
men
the
orders
were,
“As
soon
as
a
slingstone
hits
a
shield
and
you
hear
the
rattle,
chant
the
battle-hymn,
and
at
the
enemy;
when
the
enemy
turn
and
the
trumpet
sounds
the
attack,
right
about
face
and
the
sergeants
lead,
all
double
and
each
cross
opposite
his
post
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
each
other:
first
man
over
is
best
man!”
The
Kurds
saw
only
a
handful
of
men
left,
for
many
of
those
who
had
been
ordered
to
wait
were
gone
to
look
after
their
animals
or
baggage
or
women:
at
once
they
attacked
boldly
and
began
to
sling
and
shoot.
The
Hellenes
chanted
their
battle-hymn
and
charged
at
the
double,
but
the
enemy
did
not
wait;
for
they
were
well
equipped
for
running
up
and
running
off
in
the
mountains,
but
not
for
a
fight
hand
to
hand.
Then
the
trumpet
sounded
the
charge;
the
enemy
ran
faster
than
ever,
the
Hellenes
turned
about
and
made
for
the
river
at
full
speed.
Some
of
the
enemy
noticed
this
and
ran
back
to
the
river,
and
wounded
a
few
with
arrows,
but
most
of
them
could
still
be
seen
in
full
flight
even
when
the
Hellenes
were
across.
The
others
who
came
to
meet
them
went
too
far
in
their
ardor,
and
had
to
cross
again
behind
Xenophon;
some
of
these
also
were
wounded.
4.4
When
they
had
crossed
they
formed
up
together
about
midday
and
marched
through
Armenia,
all
plain
and
smooth
little
hills,
not
less
than
five
leagues;
for
there
were
no
villages
near
the
river,
because
of
their
wars
with
the
Kurds.
But
the
village
they
reached
was
large
and
had
a
palace
for
the
governor,
and
towers
over
most
of
the
houses;
provisions
in
abundance.
From
there
they
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
until
they
reached
the
source
of
the
Tigris
River.
From
there
they
marched
three
stages,
15
leagues,
to
the
River
Teleboas;
a
fine
river,
but
not
large,
and
there
were
many
villages
about
the
river.
This
district
was
called
Southern
Armenia;
the
lieutenant-governor
was
Tiribazos,
the
King’s
Friend,
and
his
was
the
right
to
mount
the
king
on
horseback
when
he
was
present.
This
man
rode
up
with
a
troop
of
horse,
and
sent
forward
an
interpreter
to
say
he
wished
to
parley
with
the
commanders.
The
captains
decided
to
hear
him,
and
coming
within
hearing
they
asked
what
he
wished.
He
replied
that
he
wished
for
a
truce,
on
these
terms:
he
would
not
damage
the
Hellenes
and
they
should
not
burn
the
houses,
but
take
what
provisions
they
needed.
The
captains
agreed,
and
truce
was
made
on
those
terms.
Thence
they
marched
three
stages
over
the
plain,
15
leagues,
and
Tiribazos
followed
with
his
force
about
a
mile
behind.
Then
they
reached
the
palace,
and
many
villages
round,
full
of
all
sorts
of
provisions.
While
they
were
encamping
came
a
heavy
fall
of
snow;
and
in
the
morning
it
was
decided
to
billet
the
companies
with
their
captains
among
the
villages,
for
they
saw
no
enemy,
and
it
seemed
to
be
safe
with
all
that
snow.
There
they
had
all
the
good
things
they
wanted,
sacrificial
victims,
corn,
fragrant
old
wines,
raisins,
all
kinds
of
vegetables.
But
some
stragglers
from
the
camp
reported
that
they
had
seen
large
numbers
of
fires
in
the
night.
So
billeting
seemed
no
longer
safe;
they
must
assemble
the
army
again,
and
so
they
did.
The
sky
seemed
likely
to
clear
then,
but
while
they
slept
there
came
snow
without
end
which
covered
the
arms
and
the
men
lying
there.
The
snow
was
a
great
hindrance
to
the
animals,
and
nobody
wanted
to
get
up,
for
it
kept
them
snug
and
warm
where
they
lay
unless
it
slipped
off.
At
last
Xenophon
condescended
to
stand
up
in
his
shirt
and
split
wood,
and
then
one
or
another
got
up
and
pulled
the
log
out
of
his
hands
and
began
to
split,
then
others
got
up
and
lit
fires
and
oiled
themselves;
there
was
plenty
of
oil
there,
hog’s
lard
and
oil
from
sesame
and
bitter
almonds
and
turpentine,
which
they
used
instead
of
olive
oil.
A
balm
also
was
made
from
the
same.
After
this
they
decided
to
billet
again
under
shelter.
The
men
with
loud
shouts
of
delight
rushed
back
to
the
shelter
and
provisions;
and
then
any
who
had
burnt
the
houses
they
left
just
out
of
mischief
were
sorry
for
it
when
they
had
bad
quarters.
The
next
night
they
sent
Democrates
of
Tenos
with
a
few
men
to
the
mountains
where
stragglers
said
they
had
seen
the
fires;
for
this
man
had
been
found
before
to
bring
truthful
reports;
and
when
he
said
it
was
so,
it
was,
and
when
he
said
it
wasn’t,
it
was
not.
When
he
came
back
he
said
he
had
seen
no
fires,
but
he
brought
back
a
prisoner
armed
with
Persian
bow
and
quiver,
and
a
bill
such
as
the
Amazons
carry.
Questioned,
he
said
he
was
a
Persian,
and
that
he
was
foraging
for
provisions
from
the
army
of
Tiribazos.
They
asked
how
large
was
the
army,
and
why
it
had
been
formed.
He
replied
that
Tiribazos
had
his
own
force
and
some
mercenaries,
Chalybians
and
Taochians;
said
he
was
prepared
to
fall
on
the
Hellenes
while
they
crossed
the
mountains,
in
narrow
places
with
only
one
road.
The
captains
decided
on
hearing
this
to
assemble
the
army;
they
marched
at
once
with
the
man
as
guide,
leaving
guards
under
the
command
of
Sophainetos,
a
Stymphalian.
While
they
were
crossing,
the
light-armed
troops
going
on
before
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
camp,
and
without
waiting
for
the
heavy
troops
rushed
on
the
camp
with
loud
shouts.
The
natives,
hearing
the
noise,
did
not
stay,
they
ran
for
it;
but
still
some
were
killed,
and
horses
were
taken,
about
twenty,
and
the
tent
of
Tiribazos
was
taken,
and
in
it
couches
with
silver
feet,
and
cups,
and
men
who
said
they
were
bakers
and
butlers.
When
the
captains
of
the
heavyarmed
heard
this
report,
they
decided
to
return
to
their
camp
as
quickly
as
they
could
to
prevent
an
assault
on
those
left
behind.
They
sounded
the
recall
and
retired,
and
reached
the
camp
the
same
day.
4.5
Next
day
they
decided
to
march
as
quickly
as
possible,
before
the
enemy
could
collect
and
occupy
the
narrows.
They
packed
up
and
marched
at
once,
through
deep
snow,
having
several
guides;
and
the
same
day
they
got
over
the
height
where
Tiribazos
meant
to
attack
them,
and
encamped
there.
From
that
place
they
marched
three
desert
stages,
15
leagues,
and
reached
the
River
Euphrates,
which
they
crossed
waist-deep.
The
source
was
said
to
be
not
far
away.
From
there
they
marched
through
deep
snow
over
a
plain,
three
stages,
15
leagues.
The
third
was
difficult,
and
a
north
wind
blew
in
their
faces,
parching
everything
everywhere
and
freezing
the
men.
There
one
of
the
seers
advised
them
to
sacrifice
to
the
wind,
and
sacrifice
they
did.
The
answer
to
their
prayers
was
manifest
at
once
to
all,
when
the
violence
of
the
wind
abated.
But
the
snow
was
a
fathom
deep,
so
that
many
animals
and
slaves
were
lost,
and
soldiers
too,
about
thirty.
They
kept
fire
burning
all
night,
and
so
got
through;
there
was
plenty
of
wood
in
that
stage,
but
those
who
came
up
late
found
none.
Those
who
had
been
there
long
and
lit
the
fire
would
not
let
the
late
ones
come
near
the
fire
unless
they
gave
them
some
of
their
wheat
or
anything
else
they
had
eatable.
Here,
then,
they
all
shared
together
what
they
had.
Where
the
fire
burned
great
holes
were
made
in
the
snow
right
down
to
the
soil,
and
so
it
was
possible
to
measure
the
depth
of
the
snow.
The
whole
of
the
next
day
they
were
marching
through
snow,
and
many
men
were
faint
with
hunger.
Xenophon
was
in
the
rearguard,
and
he
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
them.
Some
one
who
knew
about
it
told
him
it
was
hunger
faintness,
and
they
would
get
up
if
he
gave
them
something
to
eat;
so
he
went
round
the
baggage
animals,
and
if
he
found
food
anywhere
he
gave
it
round,
or
sent
those
who
could
run
about
to
give
some
to
the
sufferers.
As
soon
as
they
had
had
a
bite,
up
they
got
and
marched
on.
They
marched
until
when
darkness
came
Cheirisophos
reached
a
village,
and
found
women
and
girls
fetching
water
from
the
fountain
in
front
of
their
wall.
These
women
asked
who
they
were.
The
interpreter
answered
in
Persian
that
they
came
from
the
king
to
the
governor.
They
said
he
was
not
there,
but
about
one
league
away.
Since
it
was
late,
they
went
together
with
the
women
to
the
village
headman
inside
the
stockade.
Then
Cheirisophos
and
all
who
could
encamped
there,
but
the
rest
of
the
army,
those
who
could
not
finish
the
march,
spent
the
night
foodless
and
fireless;
some
of
the
men
perished
there.
Parties
of
the
enemy
were
always
following,
and
carried
off
disabled
animals
and
fought
over
them
together.
Men
also
were
left
behind
who
had
been
blinded
by
the
snow
or
lost
their
toes
by
frostbite.
It
did
some
good
to
the
eyes
if
the
men
marched
holding
something
black
before
their
eyes;
for
the
feet,
to
keep
them
moving
without
rest
all
the
time
and
to
take
off
the
shoes
at
night.
But
if
any
slept
with
shoes
on,
the
straps
worked
into
the
feet
and
the
shoes
froze;
for
the
old
shoes
were
gone,
and
they
had
to
make
them
of
raw
leather
from
untanned
hides
newly
flayed.
Through
such
necessities
some
of
the
soldiers
were
left
behind,
and
when
they
saw
a
black
patch
where
the
snow
had
disappeared,
they
imagined
that
it
had
thawed
there,
and
indeed
it
had
thawed,
because
of
a
hot
spring
which
was
steaming
in
a
dingle
close
by.
There
these
men
turned
aside
and
sat,
and
said
they
would
not
go
on.
Xenophon
with
some
of
his
rearguard
noticed
this,
and
begged
them
with
prayers
and
entreaties
not
to
stay
behind,
telling
them
that
packs
of
the
enemy
were
on
the
chase.
At
last
he
grew
angry,
but
they
told
him
to
cut
their
throats,
march
they
could
not.
Then
it
seemed
best
to
frighten
the
enemy
following,
if
he
could,
and
keep
them
off
the
weary
men.
It
was
dark
now,
and
the
enemy
were
following
in
confusion
and
quarrelling
over
what
they
had.
Then
the
rearguard,
who
were
well
and
strong
enough,
jumped
up
and
ran
for
the
enemy,
and
the
weary
men
shouted
as
loud
as
they
could
and
banged
spears
against
their
shields.
The
enemy
were
frightened,
and
smashed
through
the
snow
into
the
dingle,
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
from
them
again.
Xenophon
and
his
party
told
the
weary
men
that
someone
would
come
for
them
to-morrow,
and
marched
on.
They
had
not
gone
half
a
mile
when
they
came
on
their
soldiers
on
the
road,
lying
upon
the
snow
wrapt
up
and
trying
to
sleep,
without
any
guard
at
all;
and
he
made
them
get
up.
They
said
those
in
front
would
not
go
on.
He
passed
by,
and
sent
on
the
strongest
of
his
light
troops
to
see
what
was
in
the
way.
They
reported
that
the
whole
army
was
sleeping
like
that.
Then
Xenophon
settled
down
there
for
the
night,
without
fire
or
food,
after
posting
such
guards
as
he
could.
When
day
was
near
Xenophon
sent
the
youngest
of
his
men
back
to
the
weary
men,
with
orders
to
make
them
get
up
and
force
them
to
march.
Meanwhile
Cheirisophos
sent
men
from
the
village
to
see
how
the
rear
was
doing.
Glad
indeed
they
were
to
see
them,
and
handed
over
the
weary
men
to
be
taken
to
the
camp,
while
they
marched
themselves,
and
two
or
three
miles
farther
on
they
reached
the
village
where
Cheirisophos
had
spent
the
night.
When
they
met,
they
thought
it
was
safe
to
billet
the
companies
in
the
villages.
Cheirisophos
remained
where
he
was,
and
the
others
drew
lots
for
the
villages
in
sight,
and
each
led
his
men
to
their
place.
Now
Polycrates,
an
Athenian
officer,
asked
for
special
leave,
and
taking
the
most
active
of
his
men,
he
ran
to
the
village
allotted
to
Xenophon,
and
found
all
the
villagers
inside,
and
their
headman,
and
colts
which
were
being
reared
for
the
king’s
tribute,
seventeen,
and
the
headman’s
daughter
nine
days
wedded;
her
husband
was
out
hunting
hares,
and
he
was
not
caught
in
the
village.
The
houses
were
under
ground,
the
mouth
like
a
well,
roomy
underneath;
the
people
went
down
by
ladders,
but
the
animals
had
a
way
dug
for
them.
In
the
houses
were
sheep,
goats,
cattle,
birds,
and
their
young;
all
the
beasts
were
fed
indoors
on
green
stuff.
There
was
also
wheat
and
barley
and
vegetables,
and
barleywine
in
tubs;
there
were
barley-grains
floating
on
the
wine
at
the
rim,
and
straws
lay
there,
large
and
small,
without
knots.
If
you
were
thirsty,
you
picked
up
one
of
these
and
sucked
through
it.
It
was
very
strong
wine
if
drunk
neat,
and
the
taste
was
delicious
when
you
were
used
to
it.
Xenophon
made
the
headman
of
this
village
share
his
table,
and
told
him
to
fear
nothing;
they
would
not
rob
him
of
his
children,
but
they
would
fill
the
house
with
provisions
before
they
went,
if
he
would
do
good
service
to
the
army
and
guide
them
to
some
other
tribe.
The
man
promised,
and
with
all
goodwill
showed
him
where
the
wine
was
buried.
That
night,
billeted
thus,
all
the
soldiers
rested
in
the
midst
of
abundance,
keeping
the
headman
under
guard
and
his
family
with
him
safe
in
sight.
On
the
next
day
Xenophon
took
the
headman
before
Cheirisophos.
Whenever
he
passed
a
village
he
looked
in
and
found
them
everywhere
feasting
and
making
merry.
The
people
never
let
them
go
without
offering
breakfast;
everywhere
on
the
same
table
were
piles
of
lamb,
kid,
pork,
veal,
fowl,
with
all
sorts
of
cakes,
both
wheaten
and
barley.
When
one
would
show
goodwill
by
drinking
your
health,
he
dragged
you
to
the
bowl,
and
you
must
duck
your
head
and
gulp
it
up
like
a
bullock.
They
let
the
headman
take
away
whatever
he
liked.
But
he
would
accept
nothing,
only
if
he
saw
any
of
his
own
kinsmen,
he
took
him
away
with
him.
When
they
reached
Cheirisophos,
they
found
them
there
in
their
quarters,
garlanded
with
hay
and
served
by
Armenian
boys
in
their
native
costume;
they
made
signs
to
the
boys
as
if
they
were
deaf
and
dumb
to
show
what
they
wanted.
After
Cheirisophos
and
Xenophon
had
greeted
one
another
affectionately,
they
asked
the
headman
together
through
the
interpreter
who
spoke
Persian,
“What
country
is
this?”
He
said,
“Armenia.”
They
asked
again
for
whom
he
was
breeding
the
colts.
He
said,
“Tribute
for
the
king.”
The
neighbouring
country,
he
said,
was
the
Chalybeans,
and
pointed
where
the
road
was.
Then
Xenophon
led
him
to
his
own
servants,
and
gave
him
an
oldish
horse
which
he
had
caught
to
feed
up
and
sacrifice,
because
he
heard
that
the
horse
was
sacred
to
the
Sun
This
was
an
Indian
custom;
a
horse
was
consecrated
and
let
loose.
:
he
was
afraid
it
might
die,
for
it
had
suffered
from
the
march.
He
took
one
of
the
colts
himself,
and
gave
a
colt
each
to
the
other
captains
and
officers.
The
horses
in
this
place
were
smaller
than
the
Persian,
but
much
more
spirited.
Then
the
headman
taught
him
to
wrap
bags
round
the
feet
of
the
baggage-horses
when
they
are
driven
through
snow;
without
the
bags
they
sink
down
to
the
belly.
4.6
When
the
eighth
day
came,
he
gave
the
headman
as
guide
to
Cheirisophos,
but
left
all
the
headman’s
household
except
his
son,
just
growing
up;
this
boy
he
entrusted
to
Pleisthenes
of
Amphipolis,
and
he
should
be
given
back
if
the
man
was
a
good
guide.
They
filled
his
house
with
all
the
supplies
they
could
find
and
marched
away.
The
headman
guided
them
through
the
snow;
the
third
stage
came,
and
still
there
were
no
villages,
which
made
Cheirisophos
very
angry.
The
man
said
there
were
no
villages
in
that
part.
Cheirisophos
then
struck
him,
but
he
did
not
bind
him,
and
in
consequence
that
night
he
deserted,
and
left
his
son.
This
was
the
only
difference
between
Xenophon
and
Cheirisophos
in
the
whole
march,
the
violence
done
to
the
guide
and
the
carelessness.
Pleisthenes
fell
in
love
with
the
boy,
and
brought
him
home,
and
found
him
most
faithful.
After
this
they
marched
seven
stages
at
5
leagues
a
day
to
the
River
Phasis,
width
too
feet.
Thence
they
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
and
in
the
descent
they
were
met
by
Chalybeans
and
Taothans
and
Phasians.
When
Cheirisophos
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
at
the
pass,
he
halted
about
three
miles
away,
that
he
might
not
approach
the
en-
emy
marching
in
column.
He
sent
order
round
to
form
line
of
companies
in
column.
When
the
rearguard
came
up
he
summoned
captains
and
officers,
and
said:
“The
enemy,
as
it
appears,
hold
the
pass,
and
we
must
consider
how
best
to
fight.
I
think
it
best
to
order
the
men
to
breakfast,
and
then
we
should
deliberate
whether
to
cross
to-day
or
to-morrow.”
“My
opinion,”
said
Cleanor,
“is
that
when
we
have
breakfasted,
we
should
arm
at
once
and
attack.
If
we
delay
to-day,
the
present
enemy
will
be
bolder,
and
it
is
likely
that
many
others
will
join
them
while
they
are
confident.”
Now
Xenophon
spoke.
“My
opinion
is
this.
If
a
fight
cannot
be
avoided,
we
ought
to
be
ready
to
fight
our
strongest.
But
if
we
wish
to
traverse
the
pass
most
easily,
we
should
consider
how
to
pass
with
fewest
wounds
and
smallest
loss
of
men.
What
we
see
of
the
mountain
is
seven
or
eight
miles
across,
and
the
men
waiting
for
us
are
visible
only
on
the
road;
it
is
much
better,
then,
to
try
to
steal
some
part
of
the
empty
space
and
get
round
unseen,
if
we
can,
than
to
attack
fortifications
and
men
prepared
to
fight.
For
it
is
much
easier
to
climb
a
steep
place
without
fighting
and
then
to
go
along
the
flat
with
enemies
on
each
side;
without
fighting
we
can
see
better
at
night
what
is
in
front
of
our
feet
than
we
can
by
day
while
fighting;
and
the
rough
way
before
our
feet
will
be
easier
to
tread
without
fighting
than
the
level
path
when
our
heads
are
being
battered.
To
steal
a
march
does
not
seem
impossible
to
me,
since
we
can
go
by
night
so
as
not
to
be
seen,
and
keep
far
enough
away
so
as
not
to
be
heard;
and
if
we
make
a
feint
of
attacking
here
the
mountain
will
be
more
deserted,
since
the
enemy
would
remain
all
together
where
they
are.
“But
why
do
I
give
my
notions
about
stealing?
You
Lacedaimonians,
as
I
hear,
Cheirisophos,
you
who
belong
to
the
Spartan
peers,
practise
the
art
of
stealing
from
boyhood;
it
is
not
base
to
steal,
but
honourable,
where
the
law
does
not
forbid.
But
to
steal
cleverly
and
not
to
be
caught,
that
is
lawful
surely,
I
think,
and
to
be
thrashed
if
you
are
caught
stealing.
Then
now’s
the
time
to
show
off
your
education,
and
take
care
not
to
be
caught
stealing
a
bit
of
the
hill
and
not
to
be
thrashed.”
“Well
indeed,”
said
Cheirisophos,
“I
hear
you
Athenians
are
clever
at
stealing
public
funds,
although
there
is
terrible
risk
for
the
thief,
and
your
biggest
men
are
the
biggest
thieves,
if
the
biggest
men
are
honoured
with
high
office!
Then
just
show
off
your
own
education!”
“All
right,”
said
Xenophon,
“I’m
ready!
After
supper
I'll
take
the
rearguard
and
go
and
capture
the
mountain.
I
have
my
guides;
for
the
light-armed
among
my
attendant
thieves
have
caught
some
by
lying
in
wait.
I
hear
from
them
that
the
mountain
is
not
impassable,
but
goats
and
cattle
feed
there;
so
if
we
can
once
get
a
bit
of
mountain,
our
baggage-animals
can
go
too.
And
I
expect
the
enemy
won’t
stay
here
themselves,
when
they
see
us
on
the
heights
like
them;
even
now
they
will
not
come
down
to
meet
us
on
equal
terms.”
Cheirisophos
said,
“And
why
should
you
go
and
leave
your
rearguard?
Just
tell
others
to
go,
if
no
good
volunteers
turn
up.”
Then
Aristonymos
the
Methydrian
came
with
men-at-arms,
and
Aristeas
the
Chian
with
light
troops,
and
Nicomachos
the
Oitaian
with
light
troops,
and
they
arranged
to
kindle
plenty
of
fires
when
they
held
the
heights.
With
this
arrangement
they
took
breakfast;
and
after
that
Cheirisophos
led
the
army
about
a
mile
towards
the
enemy,
to
make
them
believe
that
the
attack
would
come
there.
After
supper,
when
night
came,
the
men
told
off
went
and
got
possession
of
the
mountain,
and
the
others
rested
where
they
were.
When
the
enemy
had
news
that
the
mountain
was
held,
they
awoke
and
lit
many
fires
through
the
night.
At
daybreak
Cheirisophos
sacrificed
and
led
along
the
road,
those
who
held
the
mountain
advanced
along
the
heights,
and
most
of
the
enemy
remained
at
the
pass,
but
a
detachment
went
to
meet
those
on
the
mountain.
Before
the
main
bodies
came
together,
the
two
parties
on
the
heights
met,
the
Hellenes
conquered
and
gave
chase.
Meanwhile
on
the
plain
the
light-armed
Hellenes
went
at
the
double
towards
the
ranks
of
the
enemy,
and
Cheirisophos
followed
with
the
heavy
troops
at
quick
march.
The
enemy
on
the
road
took
to
flight
as
soon
as
they
saw
the
others
worsted
on
the
hills.
Not
many
of
them
were
killed,
but
they
left
large
quantities
of
wicker
shields,
which
the
Hellenes
chopt
up
with
their
swords
and
made
useless.
When
all
had
come
up
they
sacrificed
and
set
up
a
trophy,
and
then
descended
into
the
plain,
where
they
found
villages
full
of
good
things.
4.7
After
this
they
marched
into
the
Taochian
country,
five
stages,
30
leagues.
Provisions
now
failed
them;
for
the
Taochians
lived
in
strong
places,
where
they
had
carried
up
all
their
stores.
The
army
reached
a
strong
place,
not
a
city,
a
place
without
houses,
but
men
and
women
had
all
gathered
there
with
many
flocks
and
herds.
Cheirisophos,
however,
attacked
at
once;
one
battalion
attacked,
and
failed,
then
another
and
another
again,
for
they
could
not
surround
it
in
full
force,
because
the
sides
were
too
steep
all
round.
When
Xenophon
arrived
with
the
rearguard,
both
light
and
heavy
troops,
Cheirisophos
said:
“Just
in
the
nick
of
time.
This
place
must
be
taken;
the
army
has
no
food
if
we
don’t
take
the
place.”
They
consulted.
“Why
don’t
you
walk
in?”
asked
Xenophon.
Cheirisophos
answered,
“There’s
the
way
in,
as
you
see,
the
only
one;
whenever
we
try
to
walk
in,
they
roll
down
stones
from
that
projecting
rock.
If
anyone’s
caught,
see
what
happens,”
and
he
pointed
to
men
with
legs
and
ribs
broken
to
pieces.
“If
they
use
up
all
their
stones,”
Xeno-
phon
said,
“you
may
just
walk
in—nothing
in
the
way,
I
think?
All
I
can
see
is
a
few
men,
and
only
two
or
three
armed.
And
the
distance
to
go,
as
you
see
yourself,
is
hardly
fifty
yards
to
cross
exposed,
and
there
are
thick
groves
of
pines
at
intervals;
if
men
were
to
shelter
behind
them,
what
harm
would
they
get
either
from
rolling
stones
or
thrown
stones?
The
rest
is
only
a
few
yards,
which
they
must
run
when
the
shower
of
stones
is
a
bit
slack.”
“Oh
yes,”
said
Cheirisophos.
“But
as
soon
as
we
begin
to
approach
the
grove,
down
come
the
showers
of
stones!”
“Just
what
we
want,”
said
he,
“they
will
use
up
their
stones
quicker.
Let
us
choose
a
place
where
only
a
little
space
will
be
left
to
run,
if
we
can
run,
and
it
will
be
easier
to
get
back
if
we
wish.”
Then
Cheirisophos
went
on
and
Xenophon,
with
Callimachos
the
Parrhasian,
a
subaltern,
the
officer
in
command
of
the
rearguard
officers
on
that
day;
the
other
officers
remained
in
a
safe
place.
After
this
a
number
of
men
came
out
under
the
trees,
about
seventy,
not
all
together
but
one
by
one,
each
guarding
himself
as
he
could.
Others
were
standing
by
outside
the
trees,
Agasias
the
Stymphalian
and
Aristonymos
the
Methydrian,
also
officers
of
the
rearguard,
and
others;
for
there
was
not
safe
standing
under
the
trees
for
more
than
the
one
company.
Then
Callimachos
had
a
happy
thought.
He
went
two
or
three
steps
beyond
his
tree,
and
when
the
stones
began
to
fly,
he
got
back
easily;
but
at
each
advance
more
than
ten
cartloads
of
stones
were
wasted.
When
Agasias
saw
Callimachos
doing
this
and
the
whole
army
looking
on,
he
was
afraid
he
might
not
be
first
man
in;
so
he
called
none
of
those
near,
neither
Aristonymos
nor
Eurylochos
the
Lusian,
his
comrades,
nor
anyone
else,
but
he’s
off
by
himself
and
runs
past
the
others.
Callimachos
saw
him
rushing
by
and
caught
the
rim
of
his
shield:
meanwhile
Aristonymos
ran
past
them
both,
and
after
him
Eurylochos,
for
all
these
were
rivals
in
daring,
each
trying
to
beat
the
other
all
the
time:
and
when
they
had
all
raced
in,
not
one
stone
came
from
above.
Then
there
was
an
awful
sight.
The
women
threw
down
their
children
and
themselves
upon
them,
and
the
men
the
same.
One
Aineias,
a
Stymphalian
officer,
saw
a
man
in
a
fine
costume
running
to
throw
himself
over,
and
caught
hold
of
him
to
prevent
it,
but
the
man
dragged
him
down
too,
and
both
went
rolling
over
the
rocks
and
perished.
Few
human
beings
were
left
alive,
but
numbers
of
cattle
and
asses
and
sheep.
From
that
place
they
marched
through
the
Chalybean
country,
seven
stages,
50
leagues.
These
were
the
stoutest
men
they
had
met,
and
ready
for
hand-to-hand
fighting.
They
wore
corselets
of
linen
reaching
to
the
groin,
and
instead
of
the
side-wings
thick
bunches
of
cords;
they
had
greaves
also
and
head-pieces,
and
by
the
belt
a
knife
like
the
Laconian
dagger,
which
they
used
to
butcher
any
they
caught
and
cut
off
their
heads,
which
they
carried
away,
and
they
sang
and
danced
when
the
enemy
were
likely
to
see
them.
They
had
also
a
spear
some
five
cubits
long
with
a
single
spike.
These
kept
in
their
towns,
and
when
the
Hellenes
passed,
they
always
followed
fighting.
They
had
houses
in
their
strongholds,
and
their
stores
of
provisions
were
there,
so
the
Hellenes
got
nothing
from
that
part,
but
they
lived
on
the
livestock
which
they
had
taken
from
the
Taochians.
After
this
the
Hellenes
reached
the
Harpasos
River,
width
400
feet.
From
there
they
marched
through
the
Scythenians,
four
stages,
20
leagues,
over
a
plain
to
some
villages,
in
which
they
stayed
three
days
and
got
supplies.
From
these
they
passed
on
four
stages,
20
leagues,
to
an
inhabited
city,
large
and
prosperous,
which
was
called
Gymnias.
Here
the
governor
of
the
place
sent
the
Hellenes
a
guide
to
lead
them
through
a
country
which
was
hostile
to
himself.
This
man,
when
he
came,
told
them
that
in
five
days
he
would
take
them
to
a
place
where
they
could
have
sight
of
the
sea;
they
might
kill
him
if
he
didn’t.
As
soon
as
he
passed
the
boundaries
he
advised
them
to
burn
and
destroy
the
country;
so
it
was
clear
that
that
was
why
he
came,
not
friendliness
to
the
Hellenes.
They
reached
the
mountain
in
the
fifth
day;
its
name
was
Theches.
Gymnias
is
identified
with
Erzeroum,
but
not
certainly;
and
Theches
perhaps
Bailburt
(Ainsworth,
p.
188).
When
the
first
men
reached
the
summit
and
caught
sight
of
the
sea
there
was
loud
shouting.
Xenophon
and
the
rearguard,
hearing
this,
thought
that
more
enemies
were
attacking
in
front;
for
some
were
following
behind
them
from
the
burning
countryside,
and
their
own
rearguards
had
killed
a
few
men
and
captured
others,
and
taken
wicker
shields,
covered
with
raw
hairy
oxhides,
about
twenty.
But
when
the
shouts
grew
louder
and
nearer,
as
each
group
came
up
it
went
pelting
along
to
the
shouting
men
in
front,
and
the
shouting
was
louder
and
louder
as
the
crowds
increased.
Xenophon
thought
it
must
be
something
very
important;
he
mounted
his
horse,
and
took
Lycios
with
his
horsemen,
and
galloped
to
bring
help.
Soon
they
heard
the
soldiers
shouting
“Sea!
sea!”
and
passing
the
word
along.
Then
the
rearguard
also
broke
into
a
run,
and
the
horses
and
baggage
animals
galloped
too.
When
they
all
reached
the
summit
then
they
embraced
cach
other,
captains
and
officers
and
all,
with
tears
running
down
their
cheeks.
And
suddenly—whoever
sent
the
word
round—the
soldiers
brought
stones
and
made
a
huge
pile.
Upon
it
they
threw
heaps
of
raw
hides
and
sticks
and
the
captured
shields,
and
the
guide
cut
them
up
with
his
own
hands
and
told
them
to
do
the
same.
After
this
the
Hellenes
let
the
guide
go;
they
presented
him
publicly
with
a
horse
and
a
silver
bowl
and
Persian
dress
and
ten
darics;
he
asked
especially
for
their
rings,
and
the
soldiers
gave
him
great
numbers
of
them.
He
pointed
out
a
village
where
they
could
encamp,
and
the
road
to
the
Macronian
country,
and
in
the
evening
he
departed
to
travel
through
the
night.
4.8
From
that
place
the
Hellenes
marched
through
the
Macronians,
three
stages,
10
leagues.
On
the
first
day
they
reached
a
river
which
was
the
boundary
between
Macronians
and
Scythenians.
They
had
on
the
right
above
them
very
difficult
country,
and
on
the
left
another
river
into
which
the
frontier
river
runs,
and
this
they
must
cross.
This
was
lined
with
trees
of
no
great
size
but
thickly
packed.
The
Hellenes
cut
them
down
as
they
went,
eager
to
get
out
of
the
place
as
soon
as
possible.
But
the
Macronians
came
armed
with
wicker
shields
and
spears,
and
wearing
hairy
tunics,
and
stood
in
order
opposite
the
ford
to
oppose
them,
and
threw
stones
into
the
river,
but
they
were
out
of
range
and
did
no
harm.
.
Then
one
of
the
light-armed
men
came
to
Xenophon.
He
said
he
had
been
a
slave
in
Athens,
and
knew
the
language
of
these
people.
“And
I
think,”
he
says,
“this
is
my
own
country;
and
if
there
is
no
objection,
I
will
go
and
parley
with
them.”
“No
objection
at
all,”
said
he.
“Parley
away,
and
find
out
first
who
they
are.”
The
man
asked,
and
they
said
Macronians.
“Ask
them,”
said
Xenophon,
“why
they
are
mustered
here
and
wish
to
be
enemies
to
us.”
They
answered,
“Because
you
are
invading
our
country.”
The
captains
told
him
to
say
that
they
would
do
no
damage.
“We
have
been
at
war
with
the
king,
and
we
are
on
the
way
to
Hellas
and
want
to
get
to
the
sea.”
The
natives
asked
if
pledges
would
be
given
for
this.
They
answered
they
wished
for
a
treaty
between
them.
Then
the
natives
gave
them
a
native
spear,
and
the
Hellenes
gave
the
natives
a
Hellenic
spear,
for
these
were
their
pledges,
as
they
said;
both
parties
called
the
gods
to
witness.
After
this
the
Macronians
helped
to
fell
trees
and
to
make
a
road;
they
would
allow
them
to
pass,
and
they
mingled
with
the
Hellenes,
and
provided
a
market
such
as
they
could,
and
in
three
days
brought
them
to
the
boundary
of
the
Colchians,
and
left
them
there.
In
this
place
was
a
high
mountain,
but
passable,
and
upon
the
mountain
the
Colchians
were
mustered.
First
the
Hellenes
formed
in
battle
array
to
attack
the
mountain;
then
the
captains
met
to
consider
how
best
to
attack.
Now
Xenophon
said,
“We
should
not
fight
in
line
but
form
in
company
columns,
because
the
line
will
break
at
once,
as
the
mountain
will
be
easy
here
and
difficult
there;
it
will
dishearten
the
men
as
soon
as
they
see
their
line
broken
up.
Then
if
we
make
a
front
several
men
deep
the
enemy
will
overlap
us,
and
have
men
to
spare
to
be
used
where
they
like;
or
if
the
line
is
only
two
or
three
deep,
we
must
not
be
surprised
if
they
cut
it
with
thick
volleys
of
missiles
and
massed
attacks.
If
the
line
is
cut
in
one
place,
that
will
be
dangerous
for
the
whole.
My
opinion
is,
that
we
form
in
company
columns,
leaving
the
columns
so
far
apart
that
the
extreme
columns
overlap
the
enemy
wings;
thus
we
shall
overlap
the
whole
enemy
line,
and
by
leading
in
column
the
strongest
will
go
on
first,
and
where
the
way
is
easy,
each
of
the
other
columns
may
follow
in
turn.
It
will
not
be
easy
for
the
enemy
to
penetrate
the
spaces
between
the
columns,
and
it
will
not
be
easy
to
cut
up
a
company
standing
in
column.
If
one
of
the
columns
is
hard
pressed
the
nearest
shall
help.
And
if
one
of
the
columns
can
get
to
the
top,
not
a
man
of
the
enemy
will
stand.”
This
was
agreed,
and
they
formed
in
line
of
company
columns.
Then
Xenophon
passed
from
right
to
left,
addressing
the
soldiers:
“Men,
these
whom
you
see
alone
are
left
in
the
way,
to
keep
us
from
reaching
at
once
the
place
we
have
been
seeking
so
long.
These
men,
if
we
can,
we
must
devour
raw!”
When
they
had
formed
the
companies
in
column
and
all
were
in
place,
there
were
about
eighty
companies
of
heavyarmed
troops,
each
company
about
one
hundred
men.
The
light-armed
and
the
bowmen
they
divided
into
three
parts,
one
outside
the
left
wing,
one
outside
the
right
wing,
and
one
in
the
centre,
each
about
six
hundred
strong.
Then
the
word
went
round
to
offer
their
prayers;
they
prayed
aloud,
and
chanted
the
battle-hymn,
and
advanced.
Cheirisophos
and
Xenophon
and
their
parties
of
light
troops
advanced
outside
the
enemy
line
on
the
left
and
right;
when
the
enemy
saw
them,
they
also
ran
to
left
and
right
trying
to
keep
parallel
with
them,
and
broke
apart
so
that
there
was
a
large
empty
space
in
the
centre.
The
light
troops
of
the
Arcadian
regiment,
commanded
by
Aischines
the
Arcadian,
thought
the
enemy
were
in
flight
and
pursued
with
loud
cries;
the
Arcadian
heavies
went
with
them,
commanded
by
Cleanor
the
Orchomenian.
And
when
the
enemy
began
to
run
they
could
stand
no
longer,
and
it
really
turned
to
a
flight
pell-mell.
The
Hellenes
marched
up
the
mountains
and
encamped
in
a
number
of
villages
with
plenty
of
provisions.
They
found
nothing
remarkable
there
except
the
great
numbers
of
beehives;
all
those
who
ate
the
honey
went
out
of
their
senses,
and
vomited
and
purged,
and
not
a
man
of
them
could
stand
straight
on
his
feet.
If
they
ate
only
a
little
they
seemed
like
drunken
men,
if
they
ate
much,
like
madmen;
some
even
died
of
it.
So
they
lay
in
heaps
as
if
there
had
been
a
rout,
and
they
were
very
unhappy
about
it.
Next
day
no-one
died,
but
about
the
same
time
of
day
they
came
back
to
their
senses;
in
another
day
or
two
they
got
up
dazed
as
if
they
had
been
drugged.
From
that
place
they
marched
two
stages,
7
leagues,
and
reached
the
sea
at
Trapezûs,
Trebizond
a
Hellenic
inhabited
city
on
the
Euxine,
a
colony
of
Sinope,
lying
in
the
Colchian
country.
There
they
stayed
about
thirty
days
in
the
Colchian
villages,
and
from
these
they
despoiled
the
Colchian
country.
The
Trapezuntians
provided
market,
and
welcomed
their
fellow-countrymen
and
presented
them
with
their
gifts
of
hospitality,
cattle
and
wheaten
flour
and
wine.
They
made
arrangements
with
them
about
the
neighbouring
Colchians,
particularly
those
who
lived
in
the
plain,
and
gifts
of
cattle
came
from
them
also.
After
this
they
prepared
the
sacrifice
which
they
had
vowed;
they
had
cattle
enough
to
sacrifice
fully
to
Zeus
Saviour
and
Heracles
and
the
other
gods,
all
they
had
vowed.
They
held
also
a
contest
of
games
and
sports
on
the
hill
where
they
were
encamped.
To
find
a
racecourse
and
superintend
the
games
they
chose
one
Dracontios,
a
Spartan
noble
who
had
been
banished
as
a
boy
for
striking
a
boy
with
his
knife
and
killing
him
by
accident.
After
the
sacrifice
they
gave
over
the
hides
to
Dracontios,
and
told
him
to
take
them
to
his
ground.
He
pointed
to
the
hill
where
they
stood,
and
says
he,
“This
hill
is
the
best
possible
place
to
race
wherever
you
like.”
“Oh,”
said
they,
“and
how
can
they
wrestle
on
this
hard
bushy
ground?”
He
said,
“So
much
the
worse
for
the
man
who
gets
a
fall.”
There
was
the
two
hundred
yards
for
boys,
mostly
captives;
in
the
long
race
twenty
stades,
between
two
and
three
miles
the
Cretans
ran,
more
than
sixty
of
them;
others
did
wrestling
and
boxing
and
both
combined,
the
pancration
and
it
was
a
fine
sight;
there
were
plenty
of
entries,
and
plenty
of
rivalry
with
all
their
comrades
looking
on.
There
was
horse-racing
too;
they
had
to
ride
down
the
precipice
into
the
sea,
and
back
again
to
the
altar.
On
the
way
down
most
of
them
rolled
along;
on
the
way
up
the
horses
could
hardly
walk
up
that
sheer
steep.
What
shouts,
what
roars
of
laughter,
what
cheers!

After
this,
they
met
and
deliberated
about
the
rest
of
their
travels.
First
Leon,
a
Thurian,
rose,
and
spoke
as
follows:
“To
speak
for
myself,
sirs,
I'm
tired
out
by
this
time,
with
packing
up
and
marching
and
doubling
and
carrying
arms
and
falling
in
and
keeping
guard
and
fighting.
I
want
a
little
rest
now
from
these
hardships.
We
have
the
sea,
then
let’s
go
by
sea
the
rest
of
the
way,
lying
flat
like
Odysseus,
till
we
get
to
Hellas.”
There
was
great
cheering
at
this,
“Good!
good!”
and
someone
else
said
the
same,
and
so
said
all
of
them.
Then
Cheirisophos
rose,
and
said:
“I
have
a
friend,
sirs,
Anaxibios,
who
is
now
Lord
High
Admiral
at
home,
as
it
happens.
If
you
will
send
me
there,
I
think
I
shall
bring
you
back
ships
of
war
and
transports
to
carry
you.
If
you
want
to
go
by
sea,
wait
until
I
return;
I
won’t
be
long.”
On
hearing
this,
the
men
were
delighted
and
voted
that
he
should
sail,
the
sooner
the
better.
Next
Xenophon
rose
and
spoke:
“So
Cheirisophos
is
despatched
for
ships,
and
we
are
to
wait
for
him.
But
what
is
the
proper
thing
to
do
while
we
wait?
I
will
tell
you.
“First,
we
must
get
provisions
from
enemy
country.
Our
market
is
not
enough,
and
we
have
nothing
to
buy
with,
except
some
few.
But
this
country
is
enemy
country,
so
there
is
danger
of
losing
many
lives
if
you
march
for
provisions
carelessly
and
unguardedly.
I
propose
that
you
go
in
regular
parties
to
get
provisions,
and
so
keep
safe,
and
not
go
wandering
about
anyhow;
and
that
we
should
arrange
this
for
you.”
Agreed.
“Another
thing
now:
listen.
Some
of
you
will
go
for
spoil.
I
think
it
is
best,
therefore,
that
anyone
about
to
go
for
spoil
shall
inform
us,
and
tell
us
where
he
is
going.
We
wish
to
know
how
many
go
and
how
many
stay;
we
wish
to
help
in
preparing,
if
necessary,
and
if
any
need
succour,
we
want
to
know
where
the
succour
is
needed;
if
some
unpractised
hands
undertake
anything,
we
would
offer
advice,
and
try
to
discover
the
strength
of
those
he
would
attack.”
Agreed
also.
“Something
more,”
said
he.
“Don’t
forget
that
the
enemy
have
plenty
of
time
to
make
raids
too,
and
they
have
a
right
to
attack
us
because
we
hold
what
is
theirs;
they
are
planted
up
there
above
us.
I
propose,
therefore,
that
guards
be
set
round
the
camp;
if
we
take
it
in
turns
to
watch
and
to
spy,
the
enemy
would
be
less
able
to
hunt
us.
Then
again,
look
here:
if
we
knew
for
certain
that
Cheirisophos
would
bring
us
transports
enough,
there
would
be
no
need
for
what
I’m
going
to
say;
but
this
is
uncertain,
in
fact,
so
I
propose
that
we
try
to
collect
vessels
from
hereabouts.
Then
if
he
does
bring
them,
and
we
also
have
some
here,
there
will
be
all
the
more
to
carry
us;
but
if
not,
we
will
use
what
we
have.
I
often
see
vessels
sailing
past,
let
us
ask
the
Trapezuntians
for
the
loan
of
warships,
and
bring
the
vessels
in
and
take
off
the
rudders
and
keep
them
until
we
have
enough
to
hold
us.
In
that
way
perhaps
we
shall
not
lack
the
transport
we
need,”
This
was
agreed
to.
“Consider
then,”
he
said,
“whether
it
is
fair
that
we
find
food
by
a
general
subscription
for
the
crews
we
shall
bring
in,
as
long
as
they
wait
our
pleasure
here;
and
we
should
agree
on
the
passage-money,
that
we
may
repay
service
with
service.”
Agreed
also.
“And
in
case
it
turns
out
that
we
cannot
succeed
in
collecting
vessels
enough,
I
propose
that
the
cities
along
the
sea-coast
be
instructed
to
put
the
roads
in
good
repair,
for
I
hear
they
are
in
a
bad
state.
They
will
obey,
because
they
fear
us
and
will
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
us.”
Then
there
were
loud
outcries,
“No,
not
by
road,
we
won't
go
by
road!”
When
Xenophon
saw
their
folly,
he
did
not
put
this
to
the
vote,
but
he
privately
persuaded
the
cities
easily
to
repair
the
road,
by
telling
them
that
they
would
get
out
of
the
way
more
quickly
if
the
roads
were
in
good
repair.
They
also
got
a
fifty-oar
galley
from
Trapezûs,
and
put
in
command
Dexippos,
a
farmer
from
Laconia.
But
he
neglected
his
duty
of
collecting
vessels,
and
sailed
clean
away
right
out
of
the
Euxine,
ship
and
all.
Later
he
had
his
deserts;
for
in
Thrace
he
tried
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
Seuthes,
an
Odrysian
prince
and
he
was
killed
by
Nicandros
the
Laconian.
They
got
also
a
thirty-oar
galley,
and
put
an
Athenian
Polycrates
in
command;
he
brought
in
all
the
vessels
he
took
to
the
camp.
Any
freights
they
took
out
of
the
vessels,
and
set
guards
to
keep
them
safe,
and
kept
the
vessels
for
the
transport.
While
these
things
were
being
done,
the
Hellenes
went
out
marauding,
and
some
succeeded
but
some
did
not.
Cleainetos
led
his
company
and
another
to
a
dangerous
place,
where
he
was
killed
and
many
with
him.
5.2
By
and
by
they
could
no
longer
find
provisions
within
a
day’s
raid.
Then
Xenophon
procured
guides
from
Trapezûs,
and
led
half
the
army
against
the
Drilai,
leaving
half
to
guard
the
camp;
for
the
Colchians,
having
been
ejected
from
their
houses,
were
in
large
masses
on
the
hills
above.
The
Trapezuntians
would
not
guide
them
to
places
where
it
was
easy
to
find
provisions,
because
the
natives
were
friendly
to
them;
but
they
were
ready
enough
to
guide
them
against
the
Drilai,
who
had
done
them
much
damage.
These
were
mountainous
places
and
hard
to
approach,
and
the
people
were
the
most
warlike
of
all
on
the
Euxine.
When
the
Hellenes
reached
the
highlands,
the
Drilai
burnt
all
the
villages
which
they
thought
might
be
taken,
and
retired;
nothing
could
be
found
but
a
pig
or
a
cow
or
some
other
animal
which
had
escaped
the
fire.
One
place
was
their
metropolis,
and
all
streamed
into
this.
Round
it
was
a
very
deep
ravine,
and
the
approaches
to
the
place
were
difficult.
The
light
troops
went
ahead
of
the
heavies
half
a
mile
or
more,
and
crossed
the
ravine.
They
saw
many
sheep
and
other
animals,
and
assaulted
the
stronghold,
followed
by
large
numbers
of
those
who
came
to
forage,
spear
in
hand,
so
that
those
who
crossed
numbered
more
than
two
thousand
men.
They
could
not
take
the
place
by
assault,
for
there
was
a
broad
moat
round
it
too,
supported
by
a
bank,
with
stakes
on
the
banks,
and
wooden
turrets
in
a
row
close
together;
so
they
tried
to
retire,
but
the
enemy
fell
on
them.
To
run
for
it
was
impossible,
for
the
path
down
from
the
place
was
only
enough
for
single
file.
So
they
sent
to
Xenophon,
who
was
leading
the
heavies.
The
man
came
up,
and
said,
“Here’s
a
place
full
of
stuff,
but
we
can’t
take
it,
the
place
is
too
strong;
and
we
can’t
get
away,
for
they
have
come
out,
they
are
fighting,
and
the
road
down
is
difficult.”
Xenophon
on
hearing
this
marched
to
the
ravine,
and
ordered
the
heavy
troops
to
ground
arms.
He
crossed
himself
with
the
officers,
and
considered
whether
it
was
better
to
bring
back
those
who
had
crossed,
or
to
bring
over
the
heavy
troops
also
if
he
thought
the
place
could
be
taken.
To
bring
the
first
men
back,
he
believed,
would
cost
many
lives;
they
all
thought
the
place
could
be
taken,
and
Xenophon
consented
to
try,
trusting
the
omens:
for
the
seers
had
declared
that
there
would
be
a
battle,
but
the
issue
good
in
the
end.
So
he
sent
the
officers
to
bring
the
heavy
troops
over;
and
moved
away
the
light
troops
himself,
and
forbade
all
long-distance
shooting.
He
told
the
commanders
each
to
arrange
his
own
companies
as
he
thought
they
would
fight
best;
for
there,
side
by
side,
were
officers
who
had
been
fighting
in
rivalry
for
the
honours
all
these
long
months.
Accordingly
they
did
so;
and
he
ordered
the
targeteers
to
carry
javelin
on
strap,
and
the
bowmen
to
hold
arrow
on
string,
ready
to
let
fly
at
the
signal;
and
the
light
troops
were
to
fill
their
pouches
with
stones.
He
appointed
the
proper
men
to
see
after
all
this;
and
when
all
was
ready,
when
the
lieutenants
and
petty
officers,
and
the
men
who
thought
themselves
as
good
as
anyone,
had
been
arranged,
they
watched
each
other
carefully—for
the
line
was
crescentshaped
to
fit
the
place:
then
they
chanted
the
battle-hymn,
and
the
trumpet
sounded,
they
cheered
Eleleu!
eleleu!
and
the
heavy
troops
charged
at
the
double,
and
missiles
lew—
spears,
arrows,
slingstones,
showers
of
stones
flung
by
hand,
and
some
even
carried
firebrands.
The
showers
and
volleys
drove
the
enemy
out
of
their
barricades
and
towers;
so
Agasias
the
Stymphalian
laid
down
his
arms
and
climbed
up
in
only
his
tunic,
and
one
pulled
up
another,
and
others
climbed,
and
they
took
the
fortress,
as
they
believed.
Then
the
targeteers
and
the
light
troops
rushed
in,
and
took
what
they
could.
Xenophon
stood
by
the
gate,
and
kept
all
the
heavy
troops
outside
as
far
as
he
could,
for
other
enemies
appeared
on
certain
strong
high
places.
Not
very
long
after
there
was
a
noise
inside,
and
men
came
running
out
with
what
they
had
taken,
now
and
then
one
wounded;
there
was
a
great
crush
at
the
gate.
The
fugitives
questioned
reported
that
there
were
heights
in
the
place,
and
crowds
of
enemies
who
sallied
out
and
attacked
the
men
within.
Then
he
ordered
Tolmides
the
herald
to
cry,
“Anyone
who
wants
spoil,
inside!”
Numbers
went
in;
they
managed
to
push
in,
and
overpowered
the
sallying
parties
and
drove
the
enemy
back
to
their
citadel.
So
outside
the
citadel
all
was
despoiled;
and
the
heavy-armed
men
stood
easy,
some
round
the
breastworks,
some
by
the
road
leading
to
the
citadel.
Xenophon
and
the
captains
considered
whether
it
was
possible
to
take
the
citadel,
for
that
was
certain
safety,
else
it
seemed
very
difficult
to
get
away.
They
examined
the
place,
and
thought
it
impossible
to
take.
Then
they
prepared
the
retreat.
Each
party
demolished
the
stockade
nearest
themselves;
and
they
sent
away
the
useless
men,
and
those
who
had
loads
of
stuff,
and
most
of
the
heavy
troops,
and
the
captains
left
behind
those
whom
they
trusted
most.
But
when
the
retreat
began,
crowds
of
the
enemy
sallied
out
armed
with
wicker
shields,
and
greaves,
and
Paphlagonian
helmets;
parties
took
possession
of
the
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
way
that
led
to
the
citadel,
so
that
it
was
no
longer
safe
even
to
pursue
towards
the
gate
that
led
to
the
citadel.
For
the
enemy
threw
down
great
baulks
of
wood,
so
that
it
was
dangerous
both
to
stay
and
to
go;
and
the
following
night
was
terrible.
While
they
fought
thus
in
great
straits,
some
providence
gave
them
a
way
of
escape;
for
suddenly
a
house
blazed
up
on
the
right,
kindled
by
someone
or
other;
when
this
collapsed,
the
men
cleared
out
of
the
houses
on
the
right.
Xenophon
heard
of
this
bit
of
luck,
and
gave
orders
to
set
on
fire
the
left-hand
houses
too,
which
were
all
made
of
wood;
so
they
were
soon
burn-
ing,
and
the
men
ran
out
of
these
also.
Those
at
their
front
were
now
the
only
trouble,
and
these
clearly
meant
to
fall
on
the
retreat
and
the
descent.
Then
he
gave
orders
to
all
out
of
range
to
collect
wood
and
put
it
between
themselves
and
the
enemy.
When
there
was
enough,
they
set
it
alight,
and
they
set
fire
also
to
the
houses
along
the
barricade
itself,
to
give
the
enemy
something
to
do
there.
So
they
escaped
with
difficulty
from
the
place
by
making
this
fire
between
themselves
and
the
enemy.
The
whole
city
was
burnt,
houses
and
turrets
and
barricades
and
all,
everything
except
the
citadel.
Next
day
the
Hellenes
retired
with
their
provisions.
But
they
still
feared
the
road
down
to
Trapezûs,
which
was
steep
and
narrow,
so
they
laid
a
pretended
ambush.
A
Mysian
man
(named
Mysos
himself)
took
ten
Cretans
and
stayed
behind
in
a
bushy
place,
pretending
to
wait
for
the
enemy
unseen,
but
their
shields
were
allowed
to
show
again
and
again,
being
made
of
bright
metal.
The
enemy
could
see
this,
and
feared
an
ambuscade,
and
meanwhile
the
army
went
down.
When
they
seemed
to
have
gone
far
enough,
a
signal
was
made
for
Mysos
to
come
back
as
fast
as
he
could;
and
the
party
got
up
to
retreat.
The
Cretans
thought
they
would
be
caught
if
they
ran,
so
they
plunged
out
of
the
road
into
the
wood,
and
rolled
down
over
the
rocks
and
saved
themselves;
but
Mysos
ran
along
the
road
shouting
“Help!”
A
party
went
to
help
him,
and
found
him
wounded;
then
they
retreated
themselves
with
the
enemy
on
their
heels
shooting
at
them,
and
some
~
of
the
Cretans
were
with
them
shooting
back.
So
they
all
returned
safe
to
camp.
5.3
Cheirisophos
did
not
return,
and
they
could
not
collect
vessels
enough,
and
they
could
no
longer
find
provisions;
so
it
was
decided
to
go.
They
put
on
board
the
ships
those
who
were
sick,
those
over
forty
years
of
age,
the
boys
and
women,
and
all
the
baggage
which
was
not
absolutely
necessary
for
themselves.
All
these
they
put
in
the
charge
of
Philesios
and
Sophainetos,
the
oldest
of
the
captains,
and
the
others
marched;
the
roads
had
been
made
up.
The
march
brought
them
on
the
third
day
to
Cerasiis,
a
Hellenic
city
on
the
seaboard,
a
colony
of
Sinope
in
the
Colchian
country.
There
they
stayed
for
ten
days;
there
was
a
review
under
arms,
and
their
numbers
were
counted,
and
proved
to
be
eight
thousand
six
hundred.
These
were
all
who
survived;
the
rest
had
been
lost,
in
fighting,
or
in
the
snow,
and
a
few
by
disease.
There
they
divided
the
money
taken
from
captives.
The
tithe
which
they
reserved
for
Apollo
and
Ephesian
Artemis
was
divided
again,
and
each
captain
took
a
share
to
guard
for
the
gods;
Neon
of
Asine
took
the
share
of
Cheirisophos.
Xenophon
from
the
share
which
fell
to
him
afterwards
dedicated
the
offering
to
Apollo
which
is
in
the
Athenian
Treasury
There
were
small
shrines
at
Delphi
and
Olympia,
called
Treasuries,
where
various
states
kept
their
trappings
and
some
dedications.
The
Athenian
Treasury
has
been
rebuilt
and
stands
now
on
the
spot.
at
Delphi,
and
inscribed
on
it
his
own
name
and
the
name
of
Proxenos,
who
died
with
Clearchos,
for
he
was
his
friend.
The
part
which
was
due
to
Ephesian
Artemis
he
left
behind
when
he
went
with
Agesilaos
out
of
Asia
on
the
expedition
against
Beeotia.
304
B.C.
Agesilaos,
King
of
Sparta,
was
one
of
Xenophon’s
great
heroes;
he
wrote
his
life,
and
the
story
of
this
expedition
in
the
Hellenica.
He
put
it
in
charge
of
Megabyzos
the
sacristan
of
Artemis,
because
he
was
going
where
he
might
risk
his
life;
and
he
instructed
him
to
return
it
if
he
came
back
alive,
but
if
not,
to
dedicate
some
offering
which
he
thought
would
please
the
goddess.
After
his
banishment,
when
he
had
been
settled
by
the
Lacedaimonians
at
Scillos,
in
Elis,
near
Olympia
Megabyzos
visited
Olympia
to
see
the
Games,
and
returned
him
the
deposit.
Xenophon
bought
with
the
money
a
place
for
the
goddess
which
the
god’s
oracle
indicated.
This
place,
as
it
happened,
had
a
River
Selinfis
flowing
through
it,
just
as
at
Ephesus
the
Selinis
River
flows
beside
the
temple
of
Artemis.
There
are
fishes
in
both,
and
mussels;
and
in
the
estate
at
Scillos
there
is
game,
all
the
wild
animals
that
are
hunted.
He
built
also
an
altar
and
a
temple
from
the
sacred
money,
and
ever
after
he
tithed
the
kindly
fruits
of
the
earth
and
made
sacrifice
to
the
goddess,
and
all
citizens
and
neighbours,
men
and
women,
shared
in
the
feast.
The
goddess
provided
for
this
fair
wheatmeal,
bread,
wine,
dainties,
and
a
portion
of
the
victims
sacrificed
from
the
sacred
pasture,
and
of
the
game
too.
For
there
was
hunting
for
that
feast;
the
sons
of
Xenophon
hunted,
and
the
lads
from
the
place,
and
anyone
else
might
join
in;
game
was
got
from
the
sacred
place,
and
from
Mount
Pholoë
near
the
place
too,!
pig
and
gazelle
and
deer.
The
district
lies
on
the
road
from
Lacedaimon
to
Olympia,
two
or
three
miles
from
the
temple
of
Zeus
at
Olympia.
In
the
sacred
estate
there
is
meadowland,
and
hills
covered
with
wood,
suited
for
breeding
pigs
and
goats
and
horses,
so
that
even
the
sumpter
animals
of
those
coming
to
the
feast
have
a
feast
of
their
own.
Round
about
the
temple
a
grove
of
cultivated
trees
has
been
planted,
all
that
bear
fruit
in
their
season.
The
temple
is
made
to
resemble
that
in
Ephesus,
as
little
to
great,
and
the
image
made
of
cypress
wood
is
like
the
golden
one
at
Ephesus.
A
pillar
stands
by
the
temple
with
these
words
engraved:
““THIS
PLACE
IS
SACRED
TO
ARTEMIS.
HE
THAT
OWNS
AND
ENJOYS
IT
SHALL
OFFER
THE
TITHE
EACH
YEAR:
WITH
THE
RESIDUE
HE
SHALL
KEEP
UP
THE
TEMPLE.
WHOSOEVER
NEGLECTS
THIS,
‘THE
GODDESS
WILL
SEE
TO
HIM.”
5.4
From
Cerasûs
they
passed
on,
those
on
board
ship
by
sea,
the
others
by
land.
When
they
reached
the
boundaries
of
the
Mossynoicoi,
or
Wigwam-lodgers,
they
sent
to
this
tribe
Timesitheos
the
Trapezuntian,
who
was
their
public
friend
or
patron
at
Trapezûs,
to
ask
whether
they
should
pass
through
the
country
as
enemies
or
as
friends.
The
answer
was,
that
they
should
not
pass
at
all;
for
they
relied
on
their
strongholds.
Then
Timesitheos
told
the
Hellenes
that
the
tribe
on
the
farther
side
was
an
enemy
of
these,
so
it
was
thought
well
to
invite
them
to
an
alliance,
if
they
wished.
Timesitheos
was
therefore
sent,
and
brought
back
their
chiefs.
The
Hellenic
captains
and
the
chiefs
then
met.
Xenophon
spoke,
with
Timesitheos
as
interpreter:
“Gentlemen
of
the
Mossynoicoi,
we
wish
to
return
safely
to
Hellas;
we
must
go
by
land,
for
we
have
no
ships,
and
those
people
are
in
the
way,
who
we
hear
are
enemies
of
yours.
Then
if
it
is
your
pleasure,
you
may
have
us
for
allies
and
punish
them
for
any
wrong
they
have
done
you,
and
make
them
obedient
to
you
for
the
future.
If
you
let
this
chance
go,
consider
where
you
could
get
such
a
power
to
help
you
again.”
The
chief
of
the
Mossynoicoi
replied
that
they
were
in
agreement
and
welcomed
the
alliance.
“Very
well,”
said
Xenophon.
“How
will
you
wish
to
use
us
if
we
become
allies?
And
how
will
you
be
able
to
help
us
on
our
way
home?”
They
said,
“We
are
able
to
invade
the
country
of
our
enemies
and
yours
on
the
other
side,
and
to
send
you
vessels
here,
and
men
to
support
you
and
guide
you
through
the
country.”
On
these
terms
they
exchanged
pledges
and
went.
Next
day
they
returned
with
three
hundred
dugouts
and
three
men
in
each;
two
disembarked
and
joined
the
ranks,
the
third
remained,
and
these
paddled
off
their
boats,
while
the
others
formed
up
as
I
will
describe.
They
stood
in
rows
opposite
each
other,
about
a
hundred
in
each;
all
carried
wicker
shields
faced
with
hairy
white
oxhide,
shaped
like
an
ivy
leaf,
and
in
the
right
hand
a
lance
of
six
cubits
or
so,
with
a
blade
in
front
and
a
round
wooden
knob
behind.
They
wore
short
shirts
not
quite
reaching
to
the
knees,
about
as
thick
as
sackcloth;
and
on
their
heads
caps
of
skin
like
the
Paphlagonians,
with
a
tuft
in
the
middle
very
much
the
shape
of
the
tiara.
They
had
also
battle-axes
of
iron.
Next,
one
led
and
the
rest
all
followed
singing
in
rhythm,
and
passing
through
the
ranks
of
the
Hellenes
and
their
camp,
they
set
out
straight
for
the
enemy
to
attack
a
stronghold
which
they
thought
most
open
to
attack.
This
lay
in
front
of
the
city
which
they
call
their
metropolis,
where
is
the
highest
fortress
of
the
Wigwam-lodgers.
This
was
really
what
the
war
was
about;
for
whoever
held
it
were
considered
to
be
masters
of
all
the
Wigwam-lodgers;
those
who
then
held
it
(so
people
said)
had
no
right
to
it,
as
it
was
common
property
which
they
had
seized
out
of
greediness.
Some
of
the
Hellenes
followed
these
for
plunder,
not
on
duty.
As
they
approached
the
enemy
did
nothing
at
first;
but
when
they
were
close
to
the
stronghold
they
rushed
out
and
routed
them
and
killed
a
number
of
the
natives
and
a
few
Hellenes.
They
pursued
until
they
saw
the
Hellenes
coming
up
in
support;
then
they
retreated,
and
cutting
off
the
heads
of
the
dead,
shook
them
at
the
Hellenes
and
their
own
enemies,
and
off
they
went
singing
some
tune
or
other.
The
Hellenes
were
very
indignant
that
these
men
had
made
the
enemy
bolder,
and
that
those
of
themselves
who
had
been
with
them
ran
away,
although
they
were
a
good
many:
a
thing
which
had
never
happened
before
in
the
whole
expedition.
Xenophon
assembled
the
Hellenes
and
said:
“Soldiers,
do
not
be
downhearted
at
what
has
happened.
There
is
as
much
good
as
bad
in
it,
let
me
tell
you.
First,
you
knew
that
our
guides
are
really
enemies
to
the
people
who
must
be
our
enemies
too.
Next,
you
know
that
those
who
were
careless
of
discipline
and
union
with
us,
and
thought
they
could
do
the
same
with
natives
by
their
side
as
they
can
do
with
us
by
their
side,
have
been
punished
for
that:
in
future,
then,
they
will
be
less
likely
to
be
slack
in
discipline
again.
Now
then,
your
part
is
now
to
prepare
yourselves
to
show
the
friendly
natives
that
you
are
better
than
they
are,
and
to
show
the
enemy
that
it
is
not
the
same
thing
to
fight
disciplined
men
as
to
fight
a
disorderly
mob.”
That
day,
then,
they
stayed
there.
On
the
next
day
they
sacrificed
with
good
omens;
and
so
after
breakfasting,
they
formed
the
companies
in
column
and
posted
the
natives
on
the
left
in
the
same
order
and
marched.
The
bowmen
were
between
the
companies,
a
little
behind
the
head
of
the
heavy-armed
men,
because
some
of
the
enemy’s
most
active
troops
ran
down
and
pelted
them
with
stones.
These
were
held
up
by
the
bowmen
and
the
targeteers,
and
the
others
marched
along
steadily
against
the
stronghold,
where
on
the
day
before
the
natives
and
those
with
them
were
routed.
There
the
enemy
were
drawn
up
to
meet
them.
The
natives
stood
up
to
the
targeteers
and
fought
them,
but
when
the
heavy
troops
came
near
they
turned;
the
targeteers
chased
them
right
up
to
the
town,
and
the
heavies
followed
in
column.
As
soon
as
they
were
up
beside
the
houses
of
the
metropolis
all
the
enemy
massed
together
and
fought,
casting
their
light
lances,
and
holding
other
spears
very
heavy
and
thick,
each
almost
too
heavy
for
a
man;
and
they
tried
to
keep
them
off
with
these
hand
to
hand.
But
the
Hellenes
did
not
yield;
they
went
pushing
on,
and
then
the
natives
turned
to
flight
and
all
left
the
stronghold.
But
their
king
sat
still
in
his
mossyn,
or
wigwam
lodge,
which
was
built
on
the
top
of
the
height:
there
he
stays
and
there
they
keep
him
at
the
public
expense.
He
refused
to
come
out,
and
so
did
the
one
in
the
stronghold
first
captured,
so
they
were
burnt
on
the
spot
with
their
mossyns.
The
Hellenes
ransacked
the
places,
and
found
in
the
houses
stores
of
loaves
in
piles,
last
year’s
loaves,
as
the
Wigwam-lodgers
said,
and
the
fresh
corn
stored
in
the
straw;
most
of
it
was
spilt.
Besides,
slices
of
dolphin
were
found
in
large
jars,
dried,
and
dolphin
blubber
in
pottles,
which
the
Wigwam-lodgers
used
as
we
use
olive
oil;
plenty
of
nuts
were
in
the
attics,
the
broad
ones
with
no
division.
chestnuts,
not
walnuts
Most
of
these
and
most
of
the
corn
they
boiled
and
then
baked
into
bread.
Wine
also
was
found,
which
when
neat
tasted
very
sharp
from
its
dryness,
but
with
water
it
was
fragrant
and
pleasant.
Then
the
Hellenes
took
breakfast
and
marched
on,
leaving
the
stronghold
to
the
Wigwam-lodgers
who
had
fought
with
them.
They
passed
many
strongholds
of
those
on
the
enemy
side.
Those
which
were
easiest
of
access
were
either
deserted
or
surrendered
without
resistance,
and
these
were
most
of
them.
The
cities
were
eight
or
ten
miles
apart,
more
or
less;
when
they
shouted
they
could
hear
each
other
from
city
to
city,
so
high
were
the
hills,
so
deep
the
valleys.
When
they
were
among
friends
in
this
march
the
people
held
shows
for
them
of
rich
men’s
children,
fatted
children
fed
on
boiled
chestnuts,
tender
and
very
white,
and
almost
as
broad
as
they
were
long,
with
backs
and
breasts
variegated
and
tattooed
all
over
in
flower
patterns.
They
ran
after
the
women
in
the
camp
and
wanted
to
lie
with
them
in
broad
daylight,
which
was
their
own
custom.
All
the
men
and
women
were
fair-skinned.
The
army
said
that
these
were
the
most
savage
of
all
they
had
seen
in
their
travels,
and
the
farthest
away
from
Hellenic
customs.
They
would
do
in
public
what
human
beings
would
do
in
private,
and
when
they
were
alone
they
did
what
people
do
in
company,
talk
to
themselves
and
laugh
at
themselves,
stop
and
dance
anywhere
as
if
they
were
showing
off.
5.5
Through
this
country,
hostile
and
friendly,
the
Hellenes
marched
eight
stages,
and
then
came
to
the
Chalybes
or
Ironmen.
These
are
few,
and
subject
to
the
Wigwamlodgers,
and
most
of
their
living
comes
from
working
iron.
Then
they
reached
the
Tibarenians.
Their
country
was
more
level,
and
they
had
forts
near
the
sea,
not
so
strong.
The
captains
wished
to
attack
these
places
and
get
a
bit
in
pocket,
so
they
refused
the
gifts
which
were
offered
and
told
them
to
wait
until
they
had
deliberated.
They
sacrificed,
and
the
seers
after
many
sacrifices
declared
one
and
all
that
the
gods
did
not
at
all
approve
of
war.
Then
they
accepted
the
gifts
of
friendship,
and
marching
as
through
friendly
country
for
two
days
reached
Cotyora,
a
Hellenic
city,
a
colony
of
Sinope,
which
is
in
the
Tibyrenian
country.
A
footnote
has
been
added
in
the
text
calculating
the
distance
traversed
at

leagues.
Time
taken,
eight
months.
They
stayed
forty-five
days.
In
this
time
they
offered
sacrifices
to
the
gods,
and
made
procession,
each
nation
of
the
Hellenic
race
by
itself,
and
held
games
and
sports.
They
got
their
provisions
partly
from
Paphlagonia,
partly
from
the
villages
of
the
district,
for
they
would
neither
give
them
a
market
nor
allow
the
sick
to
be
brought
within
their
walls.
After
a
while
an
embassy
came
from
Sinope;
Cotyora
was
their
city
and
paid
them
tribute,
so
they
were
anxious
about
the
city,
and
the
country
also,
which
they
heard
was
being
raided.
They
came
to
the
camp
for
a
parley;
their
spokesman
was
Hecatonymos,
reputed
to
be
an
accomplished
orator,
and
he
said:
“We
are
sent
to
you,
soldiers
and
gentlemen,
by
the
city
of
Sinope,
to
congratulate
you
Hellenes
as
victors
over
barbarians;
and
to
say
we
rejoice
with
you
that,
after
so
many
great
dangers,
as
we
have
heard,
you
are
with
us
safe
and
sound.
We
are
Hellenes,
and
you
are
Hellenes,
and
we
expect
from
you
no
unkindness
but
some
kindness.
These
men
of
Cotyora
are
colonists
of
ours;
this
country
we
have
taken
from
barbarians
and
given
to
them,
and
they
in
return
pay
us
tribute
like
Cerasfis
and
Trapezûs,
so
that
if
you
do
any
harm
to
them
the
city
of
Sinope
considers
this
as
done
to
herself.
Now
we
hear
that
some
of
you
have
violently
entered
the
city
and
there
made
yourselves
at
home
in
the
houses,
and
that
you
take
what
you
want
from
the
farms
by
force,
not
by
consent.
We
do
not
think
that
right,
If
you
will
do
that,
we
must
needs
make
friends
with
Corylas
and
the
Paphlagonians
and
anyone
else
we
can
find.”
In
answer
to
this,
Xenophon
rose
and
spoke
for
the
army:
“We
also,
gentlemen
of
Sinope,
are
well
content
that
we
have
come
through
with
our
lives
and
our
arms
all
safe;
for
it
is
impossible
at
one
time
both
to
fight
our
enemies
and
to
plunder
their
goods
and
chattels.
And
now
we
have
reached
the
cities
of
our
own
race.
Well,
at
Trapezûs
a
market
was
given
us,
and
we
paid
for
our
provisions,
and
for
their
good
respect
and
the
hospitable
gifts
they
gave
to
the
army
we
respected
them
in
return,
and
kept
our
hands
off
all
friends
they
had
among
the
natives;
as
for
their
enemies,
they
led
us
themselves
against
them,
and
we
did
them
whatever
damage
we
could.
Ask
them
what
manner
of
men
they
found
us;
for
some
of
them
are
here,
whom
that
city
sent
with
us
in
friendship
as
guides.
“Wherever
we
come
and
get
no
market,
whether
barbarian
country
or
Hellenic,
we
take
our
provisions,
not
from
brutality
but
from
necessity.
Kurds
and
Taochians
and
Chaldeans,
although
they
are
not
subjects
of
the
king,
and
although
they
are
formidable,
we
treated
as
enemies
because
of
the
necessity
of
getting
provisions,
since
they
would
give
no
market.
The
Macronians
were
not
able
to
provide
a
market,
but
although
they
are
barbarians
we
considered
them
to
be
friends,
and
took
from
them
nothing
by
force.
But
these
men
of
Cotyora,
who
you
say
are
yours—if
we
have
taken
anything
from
them,
they
are
responsible
themselves;
for
they
did
not
behave
as
friends
to
us,
but
they
closed
their
gates.
They
refused
to
let
us
in,
and.
sent
no
market
out.
They
professed
that
the
governor
appointed
by
you
was
responsible.
You
say
we
went
in
by
force
and
made
ourselves
at
home
there;
but
we
asked
them
to
receive
our
sick
and
wounded
under
shelter,
and
when
they
would
not
open
their
gates,
we
walked
in
where
the
place
itself
gave
us
leave.
We
did
nothing
else
by
force,
but
our
sick
are
quartered
in
houses
under
shelter,
and
paying
their
own
expenses,
in
order
that
our
sick
may
not
be
at
your
governor’s
mercy
but
we
may
fetch
them
out
when
we
wish.
The
rest
of
us,
as
you
see,
are
encamped
under
the
sky,
and
in
military
order,
prepared
to
defend
themselves
if
attacked,
and
to
treat
as
friends
those
who
treat
us
as
friends.
“You
have
threatened
to
make
Corylas
and
the
Paphlagonians
allies
against
us
if
it
is
your
pleasure;
well,
we
will
fight
you
both,
if
there
is
any
necessity.
We
have
already
fought
others
many
times
more
numerous
than
you;
and
if
it
is
our
pleasure
to
make
the
Paphlagonian
himself
our
ally
(we
hear
that
he
covets
both
your
city
and
the
places
on
the
coast),
we
will
try
to
be
friends
to
him
in
helping
him
to
what
he
covets.”
It
was
clear
after
this
that
the
other
ambassadors
were
very
angry
with
Hecatonymos
for
what
he
said;
and
one
of
them
rose
and
said:
“We
have
come,
not
to
declare
war,
but
to
prove
we
are
friends.
If
you
will
come
to
Sinope,
we
will
receive
you
there
with
hospitable
gifts;
and
now
we
will
ask
the
inhabitants
to
give
what
they
can,
for
we
see
that
all
you
have
said
is
true.”
Then
the
people
of
Cotyora
sent
gifts
of
hospitality,
and
the
captains
entertained
the
ambassadors
of
Sinope;
all
talked
together
in
the
most
friendly
way;
and
particularly
each
inquired
what
the
others
wanted
about
the
rest
of
their
march.
5.6
On
this
day
the
matter
ended
so;
and
on
the
next
the
captains
called
a
meeting
of
the
soldiers.
They
decided
to
call
in
the
ambassadors
and
consult
about
their
march
onwards.
If
they
must
go
by
land,
they
thought
friends
at
Sinope
might
be
useful,
since
they
knew
all
about
Paphlagonia;
they
would
need
them
all
the
more
if
they
went
by
sea,
for
only
they
seemed
able
to
provide
vessels
enough
for
the
army.
Accordingly
they
invited
the
ambassadors
to
give
their
counsel,
and
they
called
on
them,
as
fellow-countrymen,
to
begin
their
good
entertainment
by
showing
goodwill
and
giving
good
advice.
:
Hecatonymos
rose
first,
and
gave
an
apology
for
what
he
had
said
about
making
friends
with
the
Paphlagonian;
he
did
not
mean
they
were
going
to
make
war
upon
the
Hellenes,
but
only
that
it
was
in
their
power
to
make
friends
with
the
barbarians,
and
they
chose
the
Hellenes.
Since
they
asked
his
advice,
he
called
thus
upon
Heaven:
“If
I
advise
what
I
believe
to
be
best,
may
all
good
befall
me:
if
not,
I
pray
the
opposite.
This
seems
to
be
a
case
of
what
they
call
‘sacred
counsel’
which
must
be
true:
a
proverb
!:
for
now
assuredly
if
I
prove
to
have
given
good
advice,
many
will
commend
me;
if
bad
advice,
many
will
curse
me.
I
know
that
there
will
be
much
more
trouble
for
us
if
you
go
by
sea,
for
we
shall
have
to
provide
the
vessels;
but
if
you
journey
by
land,
you
will
have
to
be
the
fighters.
Nevertheless,
I
must
say
what
my
judgment
is,
for
I
know
the
Paphlagonian
country
and
its
power.
It
contains
both
splendid
plains
and
most
lofty
mountains.
“And
in
the
first
place
I
know
exactly
where
it
is
necessary
to
make
entry.
No
other
entry
is
possible,
except
one
where
the
horns
of
the
mountains
are
high
above
each
side
of
the
road;
get
hold
of
these,
and
a
few
men
could
keep
the
pass,
but
if
these
are
held,
all
the
men
in
the
world
would
be
unable
to
pass.
I
could
show
you
the
place,
if
you
would
send
someone
with
me.
Secondly,
I
know
that
there
are
plains,
and
cavalry
which
the
barbarians
themselves
believe
to
be
stronger
than
all
the
king’s
cavalry.
Just
lately
the
king
summoned
them
and
they
would
not
go;
their
governor
is
too
proud.
And
even
if
you
can
steal
your
way
through,
or
seize
the
heights
first,
and
on
the
plain
if
you
conquer
their
horse,
and
their
foot
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
thousand,
you
will
come
to
the
rivers.
“First,
the
Thermodon,
Thermeh
300
feet
wide,
which
I
believe
to
be
difficult
to
cross,
especially
in
the
face
of
so
many
enemies;
second,
the
Iris,
Yeshil-Irmak
also
300
feet;
third,
the
Halys,
Kizil-Irmak
not
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile,
which
I
think
you
could
not
cross
without
boats—and
who
will
give
you
boats?
So
also
the
Parthenis
Chati-Su
is
impassable,
and
you
will
come
to
that
if
you
cross
the
Halys.
Therefore
I
think
the
land
way
is
not
only
difficult
for
you
but
wholly
impossible.
But
if
you
go
by
water
you
can
coast
along
to
Sinope,
and
from
Sinope
to
Heracleia;
from
Heracleia
neither
land
nor
water
is
impracticable,
for
there
is
plenty
of
shipping
at
Heracleia.”
When
he
had
finished,
some
suspected
he
spoke
in
friendship*for
Corylas,
for
he
was
his
national
friend
at
Sinope.
Some,
that
he
expected
a
handsome
reward
for
this
advice.
Some
suspected
that
he
feared
they
might
damage
the
Sinopean
country
if
they
went
by
land.
But
in
any
case
the
public
vote
was
in
favour
of
going
by
sea.
After
this
Xenophon
said,
“Gentlemen
of
Sinope,
the
men
have
chosen
the
journey
by
sea
which
you
advise.
Then
the
matter
stands
thus:
if
there
shall
be
shipping
enough,
so
that
not
one
shall
be
left
here,
we
will
go
by
water;
but
if
some
of
us
are
to
be
left
and
some
sail,
we
will
not
go
on
board.
For
we
understand
that
where
we
are
masters,
there
we
can
get
provisions
and
save
our
lives
too;
but
if
we
shall
be
caught
anywhere
weaker
than
our
enemies,
it
is
plain
as
daylight
that
we
shall
be
so
many
slaves.”
On
hearing
this,
the
ambassadors
asked
them
to
send
men
to
deal
with
the
question.
They
chose
Callimachos
the
Arcadian,
and
Ariston
the
Athenian,
and
Samolas
the
Achaian;
and
they
departed.
Meanwhile
Xenophon
looked
upon
all
these
men-atarms,
and
all
those
targeteers,
and
the
bowmen
and
slingers
and
horsemen,
too,
and
all
fit
from
long
practice—he
saw
all
these
on
the
Euxine,
where
so
great
a
force
could
never
have
been
collected
without
vast
expense,
and
he
thought
it
would
be
fine
to
found
a
city
there,
and
to
add
territory
and
power
to
Hellas.
It
would
be
a
grand
place,
he
thought,
when
he
calculated
their
numbers
and
all
the
people
living
about
that
sea.
But
before
he
told
anyone,
he
called
up
Silanos
the
Ambraciot,
who
had
been
seer
to
Cyros,
and
made
sacrifice
in
consideration
of
this
design.
But
Silanos
was
afraid
this
might
be
done,
and
the
army
might
remain
somewhere;
so
he
spread
the
tale
through
the
army
that
Xenophon
wished
the
army
to
remain
and
to
found
a
city,
and
get
a
great
name
and
power
for
himself.
Silanos
wanted
to
get
back
to
Hellas
as
soon
as
possible;
for
he
had
kept
safe
the
3,000
darics
which
Cyros
gave
him,
when
he
was
right
about
the
ten
days
at
that
sacrifice.
see
p.
23
Some
of
the
soldiers
were
willing
to
obey
when
they
heard
the
tale,
but
most
were
not.
Timasion
the
Dardanian
and
Thorax
the
Beeotian
told
some
merchants
from
Sinope
and
Heracleia
who
were
present
that
if
they
would
not
find
pay
for
the
men,
so
that
they
could
get
food
on
board
ship,
there
was
a
risk
that
all
this
great
force
might
remain
on
the
Euxine.
“Xenophon
wants
it,”
they
said,
“and
he
begs
us
to
say
suddenly
to
the
men
when
the
vessels
are
here,
‘Look
here,
men,
you
see
we
are
in
a
fix
now
to
get
provisions
for
the
voyage
home,
and
a
few
little
presents
for
our
people
when
we
get
home.
If
you
like,
just
choose
any,
place
you
fancy
in
the
inhabited
country
round
the
sea
here,
where
you
would
like
to
settle.
Then
go
home
if
you
like,
stay
if
you
like:
there
are
your
ships,
choose
wherever
you
like
and
just
pounce
on
the
place.”
The
merchants
reported
this
rumour
in
their
cities;
Timasion
the
Dardanian
sent
two
men,
Eurymachos
the
Dardanian
and
Thorax
the
Beeotian,
to
say
the
same.
Then
the
people
of
those
two
cities
sent
someone
with
a
present
for
Timasion,
if
he
would
arrange
that
the
army
should
sail.
Timasion
was
pleased
to
hear
this,
and
when
the
soldiers
were
in
assembly
he
spoke
to
them:
“Don’t
set
your
hearts
on
staying
here,
men:
Hellas
and
home!
There’s
nothing
better
than
that.
But
I
hear
some
people
are
looking
for
lucky
omens
to
stay
here,
without
one
word
to
you.
I
promise
you
as
soon
as
you
are
on
board—pay,
from
the
first
of
the
month,
a
cyzicene
a
golden
coin
rather
larger
than
the
daric
per
man
per
month!
and
I
will
bring
you
to
the
Troad,
my
own
country,
although
I’m
an
exile,
but
they
will
be
glad
to
see
me
and
they
will
back
you
up.
I
will
be
your
guide,
I
will
take
you
where
you
will
find
plenty
of
money.
I
know
all
about
the
Acolid,
and
Phrygia,
and
the
Troad,
and
all
the
empire
of
Pharnabazos;
my
home
is
in
those
parts,
and
I
served
there
with
Clearchos
and
Dercylidas.”
Then
Thorax
the
Boeotian
got
up
next,
who
had
a
quarrel
with
Xenophon
for
the
chief
command;
he
said
that
once
out
of
the
Euxine
there
was
the
Chersonese
Gallipoli
ready
for
them,
a
fine
prosperous
country
if
anyone
wanted
to
settle
there,
or
he
might
go
home
if
he
liked.
When
there
was
country
plenty
and
to
spare
in
Hellas,
it
was
ridiculous
to
go
poking
about
among
the
barbarians.
“Until
you
get
there,”
says
he,
“I
promise
you
the
same
pay
as
Timasion.”
This
he
said
because
he
knew
what
the
merchants
had
promised
to
Timasion
if
he
cleared
them
out.
Meanwhile
Xenophon
said
nothing;
but
two
Achaians,
Philesios
and
Lycon,
said
it
was
a
shame
that
Xenophon
privately
advised
people
to
stay,
and
looked
for
omens
to
persuade
them
to
stay,
and
in
public
he
would
say
nothing.
Thus
Xenophon
was
obliged
to
get
up
and
speak.
He
said:
“Gentlemen,
I
make
sacrifice,
it
is
true,
and
seek
omens
as
you
see,
to
my
best
ability,
for
your
sakes
and
for
mine,
to
procure
this:
I
speak
and
think
and
do
what
shall
be
best
for
yourselves,
and
best
for
me
too.
And
now
I
have
been
inquiring
on
this
very
point,
whether
it
is
better
that
I
should
propose
it
and
try
to
bring
it
off,
or
whether
I
should
not
touch
the
matter
at
all.
Silanos
the
seer
declared
that
the
omens
were
good,
and
that’s
the
chief
thing.
He
knew
I
could
tell
myself,
since
I
have
been
present
at
many
a
sacrifice.
But
he
reported
that
the
victim
showed
some
plot
and
intrigue
against
me.
He
discovered
this
really
because
he
was
plotting
himself
to
spread
slanders
against
me;
for
he
sent
word
round
that
I
meant
to
do
this
at
once
without
your
consent.
“But
the
truth
is,
if
I
saw
you
in
difficulties,
I
should
have
inquired
how
it
could
be
managed
that
you
should
take
a
city;
when
those
who
wished
might
sail
at
once,
and
the
others
might
wait
until
they
could
get
enough
to
put
something
in
their
friends’
pockets
at
home.
But
now
that
I
see
the
merchants
from
Heracleia
and
Sinope
are
sending
ships
to
carry
you,
and
people
are
promising
pay
from
the
first
of
the
month,
it
seems
a
good
chance
to
come
safe
where
we
wish,
and
be
paid
for
it
at
the
same
time.
Therefore
I
give
up
that
plan,
and
I
ask
any
who
have
agreed
with
me
to
give
it
up
too.
“This
is
my
opinion:
While
you
are
here,
so
many
together,
I
think
you
will
be
respected
and
have
your
provisions;
for
power
gives
plunder
of
those
that
are
under!
But
if
you
are
scattered,
and
your
strength
is
broken
into
little
bits,
you
could
not
take
and
you
could
not
come
off
scot-free.
I
agree,
then,
with
you
that
you
should
sail
for
Hellas,
but
if
anyone
be
found
deserting
before
the
whole
army
is
safe,
he
shall
be
judged
as
a
criminal.
Those
who
approve
hold
up
your
hands.”
All
held
up
their
hands.
But
Silanos
rose,
and
tried
to
say
it
was
fair
that
anyone
should
go
if
he
liked.
But
the
men
would
not
let
him;
they
threatened
that
if
they
caught
him
showing
his
heels
he
should
be
punished.
The
ships
were
sent
at
once
from
Heracleia
as
soon
as
they
knew
that
the
army
had
voted
to
go,
and
that
Xenophon
himself
put
it
to
the
vote;
but
they
broke
their
promise
to
Timasion
and
Thorax
that
they
would
find
the
money.
These
men
were
confounded;
they
had
promised
the
pay
to
the
soldiers,
and
they
feared
the
army.
Accordingly
they
gathered
the
other
captains
who
had
been
in
the
secret—
these
were
all
except
Neon,
who
was
second-in-command
to
Cheirisophos,
and
Cheirisophos
was
absent
still—and
waited
on
Xenophon.
They
told
him
they
were
sorry,
and
they
thought
it
best
to
sail
to
Phasis,
as
they
had
the
ships,
and
take
the
Phasian
country;
the
king
there
was
descended
from
Aietes,
as
it
happened.
Xenophon
replied
that
he
would
not
say
one
word
to
the
army
on
this
matter.
“Assemble
them
yourselves,
if
you
like,”
says
he,
“and
tell
them.”
Then
Timasion
suggested
that
they
should
not
call
a
meeting
but
each
try
to
persuade
his
own
men.
So
they
departed
and
did
this.
5.7
Soon
the
soldiers
heard
of
all
this
confusion.
Neon
declared
that
Xenophon
had
talked
over
the
other
captains,
and
intended
to
take
the
men
deceitfully
back
to
Phasis.
The
soldiers
were
indignant;
they
gathered
in
clumps
and
circles,
and
there
was
danger
that
they
might
do
as
they
did
to
the
Colchian
heralds
and
masters
of
the
market—
stoned
them
all
except
those
who
jumped
into
the
sea.
But
when
Xenophon
found
out
this
he
decided
to
summon
a
general
assembly
at
once,
and
not
to
let
them
gather
in
groups
by
themselves.
So
he
told
the
herald
to
cry
meeting;
and
the
men
all
assembled
readily
enough.
Then
Xenophon
did
not
denounce
the
captains
for
applying
to
him,
but
spoke
as
follows:
“Men,
I
hear
that
someone
is
calumniating
me,
and
saying
that
I
mean
to
deceive
you,
and
to
sail
for
Phasis.
Hear
me,
then,
in
God’s
name.
If
I
am
proved
guilty,
I
must
not
leave
this
place
until
I
am
punished;
but
if
these
are
proved
guilty
who
slander
me,
treat
them
as
they
deserve.
“You
know,
I
suppose,
where
the
sun
rises
and
where
he
sets.
You
know
that
if
one
is
going
to
sail
for
Hellas
he
must
steer
westwards;
if
one
wishes
to
sail
for
barbarian
lands
he
must
go
back
to
the
east.
Then
who
could
deceive
you
in
that?
Who
could
persuade
you
that
the
sun
sets
where
he
rises,
and
rises
where
he
sets?
And
further,
you
know
that
the
north
wind
takes
you
out
of
the
Euxine
to
Hellas,
and
the
south
wind
takes
you
in
to
Phasis.
When
the
north
wind
blows,
don’t
they
say,
Good
voyage
for
Hellas
now!
Can
anyone
deceive
you
in
this,
then,
and
make
you
embark
when
the
south
wind
blows?
Perhaps
you
think
I
will
put
you
on
board
when
it
is
calm.
Well,
I
shall
be
in
one
ship,
and
you
in
a
hundred
at
least;
then
how
can
I
compel
you
to
sail
with
me
if
you
don’t
want
to
do
it?
How
could
I
deceive
you
and
take
you
off?
But
I
will
put
it
that
you
are
deceived
and
bewitched
by
me,
and
you
do
come
to
Phasis;
suppose
we
do
disembark
in
the
country—you
will
know
that
this
is
not
Hellas,
I
suppose?
And
I
the
deceiver
shall
be
one:
you
the
deceived
nearly
ten
thousand
armed
men.
Could
a
man
better
make
sure
of
his
own
punishment
than
by
such
a
plan
for
himself
and
for
you?
“No,
these
are
the
words
of
men,
who
are
both
fools
and
jealous
of
me
because
you
respect
me.
However,
they
could
not
fairly
find
anything
in
me
to
make
them
jealous.
When
do
I
hinder
any
of
you
from
speaking,
if
you
have
anything
good
to
say?
From
fighting
if
he
will
for
you
and
himself?
From
watching
and
caring
for
your
safety?
Come
now,
when
you
elect
commanders,
do
I
stand
in
the
way
of
anyone?
Let
him
be
commander,
I
give
way:
only
let
him
prove
he
is
doing
you
good.
“Well,
that
is
enough
about
me:
but
you—if
anyone
believes
that
he
could
have
been
deceived
in
these
things,
or
that
he
could
deceive
another,
let
him
speak,
and
say
how.
But
when
you
have
had
enough
of
this,
do
not
disperse
until
you
hear
what
a
business
I
see
beginning
in
this
army.
If
it
shall
come
upon
us,
and
if
it
shall
be
what
it
gives
signs
of
being,
it
is
high
time
to
be
careful
for
ourselves,
or
we
may
prove
to
be
the
basest
and
worst
of
men
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
earth,
in
the
sight
of
friends
and
enemies.”
When
the
soldiers
heard
this
they
wondered
what
it
could
be,
and
told
him
to
speak.
So
he
began
again:
“You
remember
at
Cerastis
there
were
some
native
strongholds
in
the
mountains,
friendly
to
Cerastis,
out
of
which
people
used
to
come
and
sell
animals
and
other
things
they
had;
and
I
think
some
of
you
went
to
the
nearest
one,
and
bought
things
and
came
back.
Captain
Clearetos
learnt
this,
and
heard
it
was
a
small
place,
and
unguarded
because
they
thought
themselves
friends.
So
he
marched
up
there
at
night,
to
sack
the
place,
without
saying
a
word
to
any
of
us.
His
plan
was,
if
he
took
the
place,
not
to
return
to
camp,
but
to
embark
on
a
ship,
which
happened
to
be
offshore
with
his
messmates
on
board;
he
was
going
to
put
on
board
what
he
got,
and
sail
clean
away
out
of
the
Euxine.
His
messmates
on
board
had
arranged
this
with
him,
as
I
now
learn.
So
he
collected
those
whom
he
had
persuaded
to
join
him,
and
set
out
for
the
place.
But
day
broke
before
he
reached
it,
the
people
collected
and
cast
down
rocks
from
strong
positions,
and
killed
Clearetos
and
many
more,
but
some
of
them
escaped
to
Cerastis.
This
happened
on
the
very
day
when
we
set
out
to
march
here;
but
some
of
those
who
travelled
by
sea
are
still
at
Cerasiis,
not
yet
having
set
sail.
“After
this,
as
the
Cerasuntines
say,
three
of
the
elders
of
that
little
fort
came
and
asked
the
way
to
our
public
assembly.
As
they
could
not
find
us,
they
complained
to
the
Cerasuntines
and
asked
why
we
had
attacked
them.
They
replied,
as
they
said,
that
it
was
no
public
business;
and
the
men
were
glad
and
intended
to
sail
here,
in
order
to
record
the
event
and
to
offer
the
dead
for
burial.
But
some
of
those
who
had
escaped
happened
to
be
still
in
Cerastis;
when
these
men
discerned
where
they
were
going,
they
had
the
impudence
to
pelt
them
with
stones
and
called
others
to
help,
The
men
were
killed,
all
three,
ambassadors,
stoned
to
death.
Upon
this
the
Cerasuntines
came
and
told
us
all
about
it;
and
we
captains
were
indignant,
and
arranged
with
the
Cerasuntines
to
bury
our
dead.
While
we
were
in
session
outside
the
camp
we
suddenly
heard
an
uproar,
and
shouts,
‘Hit
’em!
hit
em!
Shoot
’em!
shoot
’em!?
and
soon
we
saw
a
crowd
of
men
running
with
stones,
and
others
picking
up
stones.
The
Cerasuntines
retreated
to
their
ships
in
dismay,
as
you
might
expect
after
what
they
had
seen
at
home;
and
some
of
us
were
afraid,
I
can
tell
you.
However,
I
went
and
asked
what
the
matter
was.
Many
of
them
didn’t
know,
but
still
they
had
stones
in
their
hands,
When
I
found
someone
who
did,
he
told
me
that
the
market
masters
were
treating
the
army
shamefully.
Meanwhile
somebody
sees
Zelarchos,
a
market
master,
walking
towards
the
sea,
and
gives
a
shout;
when
the
people
heard
they
rushed
at
him,
as
if
a
wild
boar
or
a
stag
had
appeared
before
them.
When
the
Cerasuntines
saw
them
rushing
in
their
direction
they
felt
sure
it
was
meant
for
them,
and
ran
away
and
threw
themselves
into
the
sea.
Some
of
our
own
men
jumped
in
too,
and
anyone
who
could
not
swim
was
drowned.
Now
what
do
you
think
about
these?
They
had
done
no
harm,
they
were
only
afraid
that
we
had
gone
mad
like
mad
dogs.
“Well,
if
things
like
that
are
to
happen,
consider
what
the
state
of
this
army
will
be.
You
as
a
whole
will
not
have
it
in
your
power
either
to
undertake
war
or
to
cease
it
at
your
own
pleasure,
but
any
single
person
will
lead
the
army
wherever
he
likes.
And
if
any
ambassadors
wait
on
you,
asking
for
peace
or
anything
else,
those
who
wish
will
kill
them,
and
keep
you
from
hearing
those
who
come
to
speak
to
you.
Next,
those
whom
you
as
a
whole
elect
for
commanders
will
be
simply
nowhere;
but
whatever
single
person
elects
himself
commander
and
chooses
to
say,
‘Shoot
’em,
shoot
’em,’
he
will
be
able
to
kill
the
commander,
and
any
private
person
among
you,
if
he
likes,
untried,
if
he
finds
followers,
as
did
happen
just
now.
“Just
consider
what
these
self-elected
captains
have
done
for
you.
If
Zelarchos
the
market
master
has
done
wrong,
he
has
gone
off
unpunished;
if
he
has
not
done
wrong,
he
has
run
from
the
army
for
fear
he
might
be
killed
unjustly,
untried.
Those
who
stoned
the
ambassadors
have
arranged
matters,
so
that
of
all
the
Hellenes
alive,
you
only
cannot
enter
Cerasiis
with
safety
unless
you
have
a
force
with
you;
and
those
dead
whom
the
very
men
who
killed
them
offered
for
burial—for
those
dead
they
have
arranged
matters
so,
that
even
a
man
with
a
herald’s
badge
will
not
find
it
safe
to
remove
them.
Who
will
dare
to
go
as
herald
after
murdering
heralds?
We
had
to
beg
the
Cerasuntines
to
bury
them
for
us.
“Very
well,
if
you
are
satisfied
with
this,
pass
a
vote
to
say
so;
and
then
we
shall
know
where
we
are,
and
each
one
will
keep
his
own
guard,
and
be
careful
to
occupy
the
heights
commanding
his
own
tent.
However,
if
any
of
you
think
that
these
are
the
doings
of
wild
beasts,
not
of
human
beings,
see
how
you
can
stop
them.
Or
else,
good
God,
how
shall
we
make
solemn
sacrifice
when
we
gladly
do
impious
deeds?
How
shall
we
fight
our
enemies
if
we
kill
each
other
off?
What
city
will
receive
us
in
friendship
when
it
sees
lawlessness
like
this
among
us?
Who
will
provide
a
market
in
confidence
if
we
are
seen
to
commit
great
offences
like
these?
And
that
universal
fame
which
we
expect—who
would
say
even
a
word
of
praise
for
such
men?
No,
I
am
sure
they
would
say
that
those
who
do
such
things
are
a
bad
lot.”
Then
they
all
rose
like
one
man,
and
said
that
those
who
had
begun
this
business
must
be
punished,
and
for
the
future
no
lawlessness
was
to
be
allowed:
anyone
who
began
it
should
be
tried
for
his
life;
the
captains
were
to
bring
all
to
trial,
and
the
court
should
hear
all
complaints
from
the
death
of
Cyros
onwards,
and
the
captains
were
to
be
a
board
of
judges.
Xenophon
pleaded,
and
the
seers
advised,
that
the
army
should
be
purified,
and
there
was
a
purification.
5.8
It
was
decided
that
the
captains
also
be
brought
under
scrutiny
for
the
time
past.
Philesios
was
condemned,
and
Xanthicles,
for
the
custody
of
the
cargoes
from
the
barges,
to
pay
the
deficit,
twenty
minae;
Sophainetos,
a
fine
of
ten
minae
because,
being
elected
to
some
office,
he
neglected
his
duty.
Xenophon
was
accused
by
some
men,
who
said
he
had
struck
them,
and
made
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery.
.
Xenophon
asked
the
first
who
spoke
to
say
where
he
had
been
assaulted.
He
answered,
“Where
we
were
freezing
to
death
and
there
was
all
that
snow.”
Xenophon
said,
“Oh
dear,
oh
dear!
In
all
that
storm,
no
food
to
eat,
not
even
a
smell
of
wine,
fainting
for
hardship,
enemy
following—if
at
a
time
like
that
I
committed
assault
and
battery,
then
I
was
a
lewd
fellow
of
the
baser
sort,
and
lewder
than
a
jackass,
who
never
gets
tired
of
it,
as
they
say.
However,
go
on,
tell
us
how
you
came
to
be
beaten.
Did
I
ask
you
for
something,
and
you
said
No,
and
I
beat
you?
Or
ask
you
to
pay
up
a
debt?
Did
I
make
love
to
you?
Was
I
drunk
and
worked
it
off
on
you?”
He
said
No
to
all
these;
and
Xenophon
asked
if
he
was
man-at-arms?
No,
said
he.
Targeteer?
No,
he
said
again,
not
that,
but
his
messmates
fixed
on
him
to
drive
a
mule,
though
he
was
not
a
slave.
Then
Xenophon
remembered
the
man,
and
asked,
“Are
you
the
one
who
carried
the
sick
man?”
“Yes,
by
God,”
he
said,
“for
you
made
me,
and
you
scattered
my
mates’
goods
all
over
the
place.”
“Oh
well,”
said
Xenophon,
“this
was
the
scattering.
I
gave
the
things
round
to
others
and
told
them
to
return
it
all
to
me,
received
it,
and
gave
you
the
whole
safe,
when
you
had
reported
to
me
with
the
man.
Now
listen,
all,
and
hear
what
happened;
it’s
worth
while.
A
man
was
being
left
behind
because
he
could
not
walk.
I
made
this
man
carry
him
that
he
might
not
perish,
for
the
enemy
were
close
upon
us,
I
think.”
The
fellow
agreed.
“Then,”
said
Xenophon,
“when
I
had
sent
you
on,
I
came
and
found
you
again
with
the
rearguard,
digging
a
hole
to
bury
the
man,
as
it
seemed,
and
I
stood
there
and
praised
you.
While
we
stood
there,
the
man
crooked
his
leg,
and
they
shouted
out,
‘The
man’s
alive!’
and
you
said,
‘Alive
as
much
as
he
likes,
anyhow
I
won’t
carry
him.
Then
I
struck
you,
that’s
quite
true,
for
I
thought
you
knew
well
enough
he
was
alive.”
“What
then?”
says
he,
“was
he
any
the
less
dead
after
I
reported
to
you
and
showed
him?”
“Oh
yes,”
Xenophon
said,
“we
shall
all
die,
but
is
that
any
reason
why
we
should
be
buried
alive?”
Then
there
was
a
shout,
“A
pity
he
did
not
give
him
a
few
more!”
After
that
Xenophon
asked
the
others
to
say
in
what
place
each
had
been
beaten.
No-one
stood
up,
and
Xenophon
went
on,
“I
admit,
gentlemen,
that
I
have
really
beaten
certain
persons
for
bad
discipline,
men
who
were
content
to
let
you
save
their
lives
when
you
kept
your
places
and
fought
where
it
was
your
duty,
and
then
they
left
their
places
and
ran
on
to
plunder
and
to
cheat
you.
If
we
had
all
done
that,
we
should
all
have
perished.
Yes,
and
I
have
beaten
a
man
before
now
for
playing
the
softie,
when
he
would
not
get
up,
and
just
threw
himself
away
to
the
enemy,
and
I
have
forced
him
to
march.
In
that
awful
weather
I
once
sat
myself
for
a
long
time,
while
I
waited
for
some
men
who
were
packing
up,
and
I
found
out
how
hard
it
was
to
get
up
again
and
stretch
my
legs.
So
I
learnt
from
my
own
experience,
and
whenever
I
saw
someone
sitting
idle
I
drove
him
on;
for
to
move
and
be
a
man
gave
some
warmth
and
suppleness,
but
to
sit
still,
I
saw,
only
helped
to
freeze
the
blood
and
rot
off
the
toes,
which
you
know
yourselves
happened
to
many.
Another,
perhaps,
who
lingered
only
to
rest
somewhere,
and
hindered
both
you
in
front
and
us
behind
from
marching,
I
have
struck
with
a
fist,
that
an
enemy
might
not
strike
him
with
a
spear.
Well,
now
their
lives
have
been
saved
they
can
have
justice
done
on
me,
if
I
have
done
them
anything
contrary
to
justice,
If
they
had
come
into
the
enemy’s
hands,
what
wrong
would
they
have
suffered
so
great
that
they
could
expect
now
to
have
justice?
“My
defence
is
simple,”
said
he.
“If
I
have
chastised
anyone
for
his
own
good,
I
claim
to
defend
myself
as
a
father
to
a
son,
or
a
schoolmaster
to
a
boy.
Indeed,
doctors
even
burn
and
cut
for
one’s
good.
If
you
think
a
love
of
violence
made
me
do
it,
consider
that
now,
thank
God,
I
am
more
confident
than
then,
I
am
bolder
now
than
then,
I
drink
more
wine
now,
yet
I
strike
no-one:
for
I
see
you
all
in
fine
weather.
But
when
a
storm
comes,
and
a
great
sea
threatens,
don’t
you
notice
that
only
a
shake
of
the
head
makes
the
prowsman
angry
with
those
in
the
prow,
and
the
helmsman
angry
with
those
at
the
stern?
Yes,
for
in
such
a
crisis
the
smallest
errors
may
ruin
all.
“But
you
have
already
decided
that
I
did
right
in
striking
those
men.
There
you
stood,
holding
swords,
not
votingtables,
and
you
could
have
protected
them
if
you
wished;
but
you
did
not
protect
them,
nor
indeed,
I
confess,
did
you
join
me
in
striking
them.
So
far
you
did
give
liberty
to
the
cowardly
men
among
them
by
leaving
them
alone.
For
I
believe,
if
you
care
to
inquire,
that
the
greatest
cowards
,
then
are
the
most
violent
now.
At
least,
Boiscos
the
Thessalian
boxer,
how
hard
he
fought
then
not
to
carry
that
shield!
Said
he
was
tired!
But
now,
as
I
hear,
he
has
stript
many
men
of
Cotyora
to
the
skin!
Then
if
you
are
prudent,
you
will
treat
him
the
opposite
way
to
a
dog.
Dangerous
dogs
are
chained
up
in
the
day
and
let
loose
at
night;
you
will
let
this
man
loose
in
the
day,
and,
if
you
are
prudent,
chain
him
up
at
night.
“But
really,”
said
he,
“I
am
surprised
that
you
remember
every
time
that
I
made
myself
disagreeable
to
one
of
you.
No
silence
there,
no;
but
if
I
sheltered
anyone
from
cold,
or
saved
anyone
from
an
enemy,
or
found
something
for
a
sick
man,
or
someone
in
a
fix,
nobody
remembers
that;
and
you
do
not
remember
if
I
praised
anyone
for
doing
a
job
well,
or
honoured
a
brave
man
where
I
could.
Yet
it
is
just
and
holy
and
pleasant
to
remember
good
things
rather
than
bad.”
When
he
finished,
they
began
to
call
up
their
memories,
and
all
ended
well.
BOOK
SIX
6.1
After
this,
while
the
delay
lasted,
they
lived
partly
from
the
market
and
partly
by
making
raids
on
Paphlagonia.
The
Paphlagonians,
too,
were
quite
clever
at
kidnapping
stragglers,
and
they
tried
to
damage
those
who
were
camped
far
out;
in
consequence,
both
sides
were
bitterly
hostile.
At
last
Corylas,
who
then
was
the
ruler
of
Paphlagonia,
sent
ambassadors
to
the
Hellenes,
bringing
horses
and
fine
apparel,
and
offered
to
make
an
agreement
between
them,
to
live
and
let
live.
The
captains
answered
that
they
must
deliberate
with
the
army,
but
they
offered
hospitality,
and
invited
those
of
their
own
friends
who
seemed
to
have
the
best
right.
They
killed
some
of
the
captured
cattle
and
other
victims,
and
made
a
sacrifice
and
a
sufficient
banquet.
They
dined
reclining
on
their
low
beds,
and
drinking
from
the
horn
cups
which
they
found
in
the
country.
When
libation
had
been
made,
and
they
had
chanted
the
hymn,
first
Thracians
got
up
and
danced
to
the
pipes
fully
armed,
leaping
high
and
lightly
and
using
their
swords;
at
last
one
struck
another,
and
all
thought
he
really
wounded
him,
but
the
man
only
fell
in
a
clever
way
on
purpose;
and
the
Paphlagonians
shrieked
aloud.
The
other
stript
off
his
arms,
and
went
out
singing
the
Sitalcas
the
national
hymn,
named
after
the
national
hero
;
others
of
the
Thracians
carried
him
out
like
a
corpse,
but
he
had
no
harm.
After
this
the
Ainianians
and
Magnesians
rose,
and
danced
in
full
armour
what
they
call
the
Harvest
Song.
The
method
of
dancing
is,
that
one
lays
down
his
arms,
and
sows,
and
drives
the
plow,
turning
again
and
again
as
in
fear.
A
raider
approaches;
the
other
looks
out,
and
picks
up
his
arms,
and
goes
to
meet
him,
and
fights
in
front
of
the
yoke.
These
also
did
their
play
in
time
with
the
pipes.
At
last
the
raider
ties
up
his
man
and
drives
the
oxen
away;
or
sometimes
the
plowman
ties
up
the
raider,
and
then
fastens
him
beside
the
oxen,
and
drives
him
with
hands
fastened
behind
his
back.
After
this
a
Mysian
came
in
with
a
light
shield
in
each
hand.
Sometimes
he
danced
in
mimicry
of
two
men
fighting;
sometimes
he
used
the
shields
as
if
against
one,
and
then
he
twirled
about
and
threw
somersaults
out
of
the
door
holding
the
shields,
and
a
rare
good
show
it
was.
At
last
he
danced
the
Persian,
clashing
the
shields
together,
crouching
and
jumping
up;
and
all
this
he
did
in
time
with
the
pipes.
Next
Mantineans
and
other
Arcadians
rose,
arrayed
in
their
finest
accoutrements,
and,
keeping
time
with
the
pipes,
did
the
march-at-arms,
and
chanted
their
hymn,
and
danced
as
they
do
in
processionals
before
the
gods.
When
the
Paphlagonians
saw
these,
they
said
how
strange
it
was
that
all
the
dances
were
done
under
arms.
The
Mysian
saw
their
astonishment,
and
persuaded
an
Arcadian,
who
owned
a
dancing-girl,
to
dress
her
in
her
finery,
and
let
him
bring
her
in
with
a
light
shield
in
her
hand.
She
danced
the
Pyrrhic
daintily.
Then
there
was
loud
applause,
and
the
Paphlagonians
asked
if
these
women
fought
by
their
side.
They
said
yes,
it
was
the
women
who
drove
the
Great
King
out
of
camp.
This
was
the
end
of
that
night.
Next
day
the
captains
introduced
them
to
the
army.
The
soldiers
voted
for
peace
between
them.
Live
and
let
live.
After
this
the
Paphlagonians
went
away,
and
the
Hellenes,
as
there
seemed
to
be
shipping
enough
ready,
embarked,
and
sailed
a
day
and
a
night
before
a
good
wind,
keeping
Paphlagonia
on
the
left.
The
day
after,
they
reached
Sinope,
and
anchored
in
Harmene,
a
port
of
Sinope.
The
city
lies
in
Paphlagonia,
but
they
are
a
colony
from
Miletos.
They
sent
out
gifts
of
welcome,
barléy-meal
three
thousand
measures,
each
about
14
bushels
wine
fifteen
hundred
jars.
Cheirisophos
was
there
too,
with
a
ship
of
war.
The
soldiers
expected
him
to
have
something
for
them,
but
he
had
nothing;
he
said
only
that
Admiral
Anaxibios
and
the
others
sent
their
congratulations,
and
Anaxibios
promised
that
if
they
came
out
of
the
Euxine
there
should
be
pay
for
them.
In
this
port
of
Harmene
they
stayed
five
days.
Being
now
so
near
to
Hellas,
they
felt
more
than
ever
anxious
to
come
home
with
something
in
their
pockets.
They
thought
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
choose
one
commander;
for
one
man
could
manage
the
army
better
than
many,
and
use
it
by
night
or
day;
if
they
had
to
be
secret,
things
would
be
hidden
better;
and
if
they
must
be
first,
one
is
less
likely
to
be
too
late,
for
there
would
be
no
need
of
discussion,
but
the
opinion
of
the
one
would
be
carried
out.
Hitherto
the
captains
had
decided
everything
by
a
majority.
é
With
this
notion
they
turned
to
Xenophon.
The
captains
approached
him,
and
said
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
army;
and
each
of
them
with
the
greatest
goodwill
pressed
him
to
undertake
the
command.
Xenophon
was
inclined
for
many
reasons
to
accept.
He
thought
that
his
honour
would
be
greater
among
his
friends,
and
his
reputation
would
be
greater
in
his
native
city,
and
perhaps
it
might
benefit
the
army.
These
thoughts
made
him
wish
to
be
sole
plenipotentiary
commander.
But
when
he
remembered
that
no
man
can
forsee
how
the
future
will
turn
out,
and
thus
there
was
danger
that
he
might
lose
even
the
reputation
he
had,
he
was
in
doubt.
In
his
perplexity
he
thought
it
best
to
lay
the
matter
before
the
gods
above
and
let
them
decide.
He
provided
two
victims,
and
made
sacrifice
to
Zeus
the
King,
the
god
to
whom
the
oracle
at
Delphi
had
bidden
him
sacrifice
see
p.
59
;
and
he
it
was
had
sent
the
dream,
so
he
believed,
which
he
saw
when
he
began
to
take
part
in
the
business
of
the
army.
And
at
the
time
when
he
set
out
from
Ephesus
to
be
introduced
to
Cyros,
he
remembered
an
eagle
which
had
screamed
on
the
right,
yet
still
sitting;
and
the
seer
who
was
escorting
him
said
that
this
was
a
great
omen,
and
proper
for
a
great
man,
full
of
glory
and
yet
full
of
hardship,
for
the
other
birds
are
most
ready
to
attack
the
eagle
when
sitting;
however,
not
an
omen
of
profit,
for
the
eagle
takes
his
provender
on
the
wing
rather
than
sitting.
When
he
made
this
sacrifice,
the
god
signified
quite
clearly
that
he
was
neither
to
ask
for
further
command
nor
accept
it
if
they
should
elect
him.
So
things
were
when
the
army
assembled,
and
all
voted
to
elect
one;
when
this
was
decided,
they
proposed
Xenophon.
Since
it
was
clear
that
they
meant
to
elect
him,
if
it
were
put
to
the
vote,
he
rose
and
spoke
as
follows:
“Gentlemen,
I
am
but
human,
and
I
cannot
help
being
pleased
to
be
honoured
by
you.
I
thank
you,
and
I
pray
the
gods
to
grant
that
I
may
be
the
cause
of
some
good
for
you.
But
to
prefer
me
as
your
commander
when
a
man
of
Lacedaimon
is
present
seems
to
be
neither
profitable
to
you
nor
to
me:
you
would
be
less
likely
to
win
anything
from
them
if
you
have
need;
and
for
me
IJ
think
such
a
thing
is
not
very
safe.
For
I
see
that
they
never
ceased
fighting
against
my
own
native
city,
until
the
whole
city
was
compelled
to
admit
that
Lacedaimon
was
the
leader:
but
as
soon
as
they
did
admit
that,
they
ceased
fighting
at
once
and
besieged
the
city
no
longer.
Then,
if
seeing
this
I
should
annul
this
high
claim
of
theirs,
as
far
as
in
me
lies,
I
have
a
notion
I
might
be
taught
a
lesson
too
quickly.
As
to
your
own
notion,
that
there
would
be
less
faction
with
me
commander
than
with
many,
be
sure
that
if
you
elect
another
you
will
not
find
me
leading
a
faction;
for
I
think
that
he
who
leads
faction
against
his
commander
in
war
leads
faction
against
his
own
life.
But
if
you
elect
me,
I
should
not
be
surprised
if
you
should
find
someone
angry
both
with
you
and
with
me.”
When
he
finished
many
more
got
up
and
said
that
he
ought
to
be
commander;
and
Agasias
the
Stymphalian
said
it
would
be
ridiculous
if
things
really
were
as
he
described.
“Will
Lacedaimon
fly
into
a
rage
if
a
dinner
party
does
not
put
a
Lacedaimonian
in
the
chair?
If
things
really
are
so,”
says
he,
“we
can’t
be
officers,
because
we
are
Arcadians!”
Loud
applause
followed;
they
thought
that
good,
Xenophon
saw
that
something
more
was
necessary,
and
he
rose
and
said,
“Well,
gentlemen,
I
must
tell
you
the
whole
truth,
on
my
oath
by
all
the
gods
and
goddesses
in
heaven.
I
made
sacrifice
to
inquire
whether
it
was
better
for
you
to
entrust
this
command
to
me,
and
for
me
to
accept;
and
the
gods
gave
such
manifest
signs
in
the
victims,
that
even
an
ignoramus
could
see
I
must
hold
aloof
from
sole
command!”
After
this
they
elected
Cheirisophos;
and
Cheirisophos,
elected,
rose
up
and
said,
“At
least
I
will
assure
you,
gentlemen,
that
I
would
have
made
no
faction
myself
if
you
had
elected
another;
however,
as
regards
Xenophon,
you
were
kind
to
him
not
to
elect
him,
for
as
it
is,
Dexippos
see
p.
162
has
been
running
him
down
to
Anaxibios,
although
I
told
him
to
shut
up.
He
said
Xenophon
would
rather
share
command
of
Clearchos’s
force
with
a
Dardanian,
Timasion,
than
with
himself,
a
Laconian.
However,
since
you
have
chosen
me,”
says
he,
“I
also
will
try
my
best
to
do
you
some
good.
Then
you
must
all
make
ready
to
set
sail
to-morrow,
if
there
is
good
weather.
We
shall
sail
to
Heracleia,
so
you
must
do
your
best
to
make
anchorage
there.
What
next,
we
will
consider
when
we
get
there.”
6.2
From
that
place
next
day
they
set
sail
before
a
good
wind,
and
for
two
days
they
coasted.
As
they
sailed
along
the
coast
they
had
seen
Jason’s
Beach,
Yasoun
Bouroun
where
the
Argo
is
said
to
have
moored;
and
the
mouths
of
the
rivers,
first
Thermodon,
then
Iris,
then
Halys,
then
Parthenios,
and
lastly
they
reached
Heracleia,
a
Hellenic
city
and
a
colony
of
Megara,
lying
in
the
country
of
the
Mariandynians.
So
they
anchored
by
the
Acherusian
Chersonese,
where
Heracles
is
said
to
have
gone
down
for
the
Dog
Cerberos;
and
there
they
still
show
the
marks
of
his
descent,
a
cleft
more
than
four
hundreds
yards
deep.
There
the
people
sent
gifts
of
hospitality
from
Heracleia,
barley
meal
three
thousand
measures,
and
wine
two
thousand
jars,
twenty
oxen,
and
a
hundred
sheep.
There
is
a
river
running
across
the
plain,
named
Lycos,
width
about
two
hundred
feet.
The
soldiers
met
and
debated
whether
to
go
on
by
land
or
sea
out
of
the
Euxine.
Lycon
the
Achaian
rose
and
said:
“I
am
surprised,
gentlemen,
at
our
commanders;
they
do
not
try
to
get
provisions
for
us,
for
these
gifts
are
not
three
days’
food
for
the
army.
Where
to
get
food
for
our
journey
I
don’t
know,”
says
he.
“I
propose,
then,
that
we
demand
from
Heracleia
not
less
than
three
thousand
cyzicenes.”
Another
proposed
not
less
than
ten
thousand;
that
ambassadors
should
be
chosen
on
the
spot,
and
that
the
army
should
stay
while
the
ambassadors
went
to
the
city
to
see
what
offers
were
made,
and
decide
accordingly.
Then
they
put
forward
as
ambassadors,
first
Cheirisophos,
because
he
was
commander,
and
some
added
Xenophon.
They
opposed
strongly;
both
agreed
that
they
ought
not
to
force
from
a
Hellenic
city,
and
a
friend,
what
they
did
not
offer
willingly.
Since
these
two
were
not
so
minded
they
sent
Lycon
the
Achaian
and
a
Parrhasian
Callimachos
and
Agasias
the
Stymphalian.
Those
went
and
told
the
resolutions,
and
Lycon
added
threats,
as
was
said,
if
they
should
refuse.
The
Heracleots
replied
that
they
would
deliberate;
and
at
once
they
brought
in
everything
from
the
farms,
and
made
their
market
inside,
and
shut
the
gates,
and
arms
could
be
seen
on
the
walls.
Then
those
who
had
made
this
mess
laid
the
blame
on
their
captains,
who
had
spoilt
the
business,
as
they
said.
The
Arcadians
and
the
Achaians
joined
forces,
under
the
ringleaders
Callimachos
and
Lycon.
They
said
it
was
a
shame
that
Peloponnesians
should
be
commanded
by
an
Athenian
and
a
Lacedaimonian
who
had
brought
no
force
to
the
army;
they
had
the
work
themselves,
and
others
had
the
profits,
and
that,
too,
although
they
had
saved
the
army
themselves;
Arcadians
and
Achaians
had
done
it,
the
rest
of
the
army
was
nothing
(and
in
truth
Arcadians
and
Achaians
were
more
than
half
the
army):
then
if
they
had
common
sense,
they
would
join
and
elect
their
own
captains
for
themselves,
and
go
on
by
themselves,
and
try
to
make
a
good
job
of
it.
This
was
decided.
Any
Arcadians
or
Achaians
that
were
under
Cheirisophos
and
Xenophon
left
them;
they
joined
together,
and
elected
captains
from
themselves,
ten
in
number,
and
voted
that
each
was
to
do
what
should
be
decided
by
a
majority.
Thus
the
sole
command
of
Cheirisophos
was
ended
then
and
there,
a
week
after
he
was
elected.
However,
Xenophon
wished
to
proceed
in
company
with
them,
which
he
thought
safer
than
that
everyone
should
go
by
himself,
But
Neon
persuaded
him
to
go
separately;
for
Cheirisophos
had
told
him
that
Cleandros,
the
governor
at
Byzantium,
said
he
was
coming
with
ships-of-war
to
Calpe’s
Haven;
he
wanted
no-one
else
to
share,
only
they
and
their
own
men
would
have
a
passage
home
in
these
ships,
and
that
was
why
he
gave
such
advice.
Cheirisophos
just
let
him
do
what
he
liked;
he
was
in
despair
at
the
whole
business,
and
hated
the
army.
Xenophon
still
wanted
to
be
quit
of
the
army
and
sail
away;
but
he
sacrificed
to
Leader
Heracles
and
asked
his
question,
whether
it
were
right
and
good
to
quit
the
army
with
those
that
remained
of
his
men,
or
to
go
on
with
the
army;
and
the
god
signified
by
the
omens
that
he
should
go
with
the
army.
Thus
the
army
was
divided
into
three:
Arcadians
and
Achaians,
more
than
four
thousand,
all
men-at-arms;
Cheirisophos
with
fourteen
hundred
men-at-arms
and
seven
hundred
targeteers,
Clearchos’s
Thracians;
and
Xenophon
with
seventeen
hundred
men-at-arms,
and
three
hundred
targeteers—he
alone
had
cavalry,
about
forty
horsemen.
The
Arcadians
managed
to
get
ships
from
Heracleia,
and
sailed
away
first.
They
wished
to
make
a
sudden
descent
on
Bithynia,
and
get
as
much
as
possible,
and
they
landed
at
Calpe’s
Haven
Karpe
Liman
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
Thracian
coast.
Cheirisophos
marched
by
land
from
Heracleia,
at
first
through
the
country,
but
when
he
came
to
Thrace
he
kept
along
the
seashore,
for
he
was
ill.
Xenophon
took
ship
to
the
boundaries
of
Thrace
and
the
Heracleiotid,
and
went
on
across
country.
6.3
We
will
follow
each
party.
The
Arcadians
landed
by
night
in
Calpe’s
Haven,
and
marched
to
the
first
villages,
about
eight
miles
from
the
sea.
At
dawn
each
captain
led
his
own
company
to
a
village;
two
went
together
if
the
village
appeared
to
be
large.
They
arranged
a
rendezvous
on
a
hill;
and
by
their
sudden
assault
they
took
many
captives
and
surrounded
large
quantities
of
sheep.
But
the
Thracians
who
escaped
gathered
together;
and
very
many
did
escape
with
their
light
shields
clean
out
of
the
hands
of
the
heavy
troops.
When
these
had
assembled,
first
they
attacked
the
company
of
Smicres,
one
of
the
captains,
as
it
was
retiring
to
the
rendezvous
laden
with
booty.
The
Hellenes
for
a
time
fought
marching,
but
in
crossing
a
ravine
the
natives
routed
them
and
killed
them
all
with
Smicres
himself.
From
the
company
of
Hegesandros,
another
of
the
ten
captains,
they
left
only
eight
men,
and
the
captain
himself
was
saved
alive.
The
other
companies
rendezvoused,
some
with
difficulty
and
some
without;
but
the
Thracians
after
this
great
success
went
round
shouting
for
help
and
collected
in
force
during
the
night.
At
daybreak
they
mustered
round
the
hill
where
the
Hellenes
were
encamped,
horsemen
and
targeteers
in
large
numbers,
and
more
were
always
rolling
in.
They
attacked
the
heavy
troops
with
complete
safety,
for
the
Hellenes
had
not
a
bowman,
not
a
javelineer,
not
a
horseman:
the
natives
ran
in
and
rode
in
and
cast
their
javelins,
and
when
the
others
attacked
they
easily
escaped,
and
set
on
them
from
all
sides.
Most
of
them
were
wounded,
but
none
of
the
natives;
so
they
could
not
stir
out
of
the
place,
and
at
last
the
Thracians
cut
them
off
from
their
water
too.
In
this
despair
they
parleyed
for
a
truce,
and
they
came
to
some
agreement,
but
the
Thracians
would
not
give
hostages
when
the
demand
was
made,
and
there
was
the
rub.
So
much
for
the
Arcadians.
Cheirisophos
marched
safely
as
far
as
Calpe’s
Haven.
Xenophon
went
on
his
march
across
country;
and
on
the
way
his
horsemen
met
some
old
men
going
somewhere.
These
were
brought
to
Xenophon,
and
he
asked
if
they
had
noticed
another
Hellenic
force
anywhere
about.
They
told
him
all
that
had
happened,
and
that
they
were
now
encamped
on
a
hill
with
all
the
Thracians
round
them
in
a
ring.
Then
he
put
the
old
men
under
strict
guard,
to
show
him
the
way;
and
setting
outposts,
he
assembled
his
men,
and
spoke
to
them.
“Soldiers,”
he
said,
“the
Arcadians,
or
what
is
left
of
them,
are
besieged
on
a
hill,
and
many
have
been
killed.
I
think
that
if
they
are
to
be
destroyed
there
will
be
no
safety
for
us,
with
such
hosts
of
enemies,
so
many
and
so
bold.
Then
it
is
best
for
us
to
rescue
these
men,
and
have
them
fighting
with
us
if
they
are
still
safe;
or
we
shall
be
left
alone
and
in
danger.
For
there
is
no
refuge
for
us
here;
it
is
a
long
way
back
to
Heracleia,
and
a
long
way
on
to
Chrysopolis,
but
the
enemy
are
close
by:
the
shortest
way
is
to
Calpe’s
Haven,
where
we
suppose
Cheirisophos
to
be,
if
he
is
safe.
“But
then,
you
may
think,
no
ships
are
there
to
sail
in,
and
if
we
stay
there,
not
even
one
day’s
provisions.
But
if
the
besieged
men
are
lost,
it
is
a
greater
danger
for
us
to
have
only
Cheirisophos
with
us
than
if
they
are
saved,
all
together
to
hold
on
to
safety.
Then
we
must
make
up
our
minds
to
do
a
noble
feat
in
saving
so
many
Hellenes,
or
to
find
a
glorious
end
this
day!
It
may
be
that
God
leads
us
now,
whose
will
is
to
humble
the
boastful
as
over-proud,
but
to
make
us
more
honourable
than
they
are,
because
we
do
nothing
without
asking
first
the
grace
of
God.
“So
you
must
follow,
and
let
your
one
thought
be
to
obey
orders.
Let
us
go
forwards
now
until
it
seems
to
be
time
for
supper;
and
while
we
are
marching,
let
Timasion
ride
ahead
with
the
horsemen,
keeping
us
in
sight,
and
let
him
explore
in
front
that
we
may
miss
nothing.”
Then
he
led
the
way.
He
sent
scouts
on
the
flanks
and
up
the
hills,
active
men
from
the
light-armed
troops,
to
signal
if
they
saw
signs
of
anything
approaching,
and
he
gave
orders
to
set
on
fire
all
that
would
burn.
The
horsemen
scattered
as
far
as
was
convenient,
the
targeteers
climbed
the
heights,
and
all
set
fire
to
whatever
they
saw
that
would
burn,
and
so
did
the
army
if
they
found
something
left:
so
the
whole
country
seemed
to
be
in
a
blaze,
and
the
army
appeared
very
large.
When
the
time
came,
they
encamped
off
the
road
on
a
hill;
they
saw
the
enemy
fires
about
five
miles
off,
and
they
lit
as
many
fires
as
possible
themselves.
As
soon
as
they
had
supped,
the
order
was
given
to
quench
the
fires.
Outposts
were
set,
and
they
slept
all
that
night.
But
at
daylight
they
offered
prayer
to
the
gods,
and
marched
forward
in
battle
order
as
quickly
as
they
could.
Timasion
with
the
guides
found
themselves
without
knowing
it
on
the
hill
where
the
Hellenes
had
been
besieged.
They
saw
no
army,
neither
enemies
nor
friends,
and
reported
this
to
Xenophon
and
his
men;
but
there
were
a
few
old
women
and
old
men
and
sheep
and
cattle
left
behind.
At
first
they
wondered
what
had
happened,
but
they
learnt
from
those
left
behind
that
the
Thracians
had
decamped
after
nightfall
and
were
gone;
and
the
Hellenes
were
gone,
where
they
did
not
know.
Hearing
this
news,
after
breakfast,
Xenophon
and
his
party
packed
up
and
marched,
hoping
to
meet
the
others
at
Calpe’s
Haven.
On
the
march
they
saw
the
tracks
of
the
Arcadians
and
Achaians
on
the
road
to
Calpe;
and
when
they
reached
the
place,
the
two
parties
saw
each
other
with
joy
and
embraced
like
brothers.
The
Arcadians
asked
Xenophon’s
men
why
they
had
put
out
their
fires.
“When
we
saw
no
fires,”
they
said,
“at
first
we
thought
you
would
attack
the
enemy
that
night;
and
the
enemy
feared
that,
as
it
seemed
to
us,
and
went
away
for
that
reason;
for
they
did
go
about
that
time.
But
as
you
never
came,
and
it
was
too
late,
we
thought
you
had
learnt
all
about
us
and
that
frightened
you,
so
you
scampered
away
to
the
sea.
Then
we
decided
not
to
be
left
behind,
and
so
we
came
here
too.”
6.4
That
day
they
spent
under
the
open
sky
on
the
shore
beside
the
harbour.
The
place
called
Calpe’s
Haven
is
in
Asiatic
Thrace,
This
Thrace
extends
from
the
mouth
of
the
Euxine,
along
the
sea
to
Heracleia
on
the
right.
In
a
ship-of-war
it
is
a
long
day’s
journey
by
oar
to
Heracleia
from
Byzantion;
in
between
there
is
no
city
either
Hellenic
or
friendly,
but
only
the
Thracians
of
Bithynia;
any
Hellenes
they
take
shipwrecked
or
otherwise
they
are
said
to
treat
with
great
cruelty.
Calpe’s
Haven
lies
half-way
on
the
voyage
between
Heracleia
and
Byzantion.
It
is
a
promontory
jutting
out
into
the
sea;
the
part
by
the
sea
being
a
sheer
cliff,
height
where
it
is
least
no
less
than
twenty
fathoms,
and
facing
the
land
a
neck
about
four
hundred
feet
wide.
The
space
inside
the
neck
is
enough
for
ten
thousand
inhabitants.
The
harbour
under
the
cliff
has
a
beach
towards
the
west.
There
is
a
spring
of
plentiful
sweet
water
close
beside
the
sea
commanded
by
the
promontory.
There
is
abundance
of
all
sorts
of
wood,
and
particularly
a
great
deal
of
fine
wood
for
shipbuilding
close
to
the
sea.
The
highland
stretches
into
the
country
some
two
or
three
miles,
good
soil
without
stones;
and
the
part
along
the
seashore
is
longer
still,
set
thick
with
much
timber
of
all
sorts.
The
rest
of
the
country
for
a
long
way
round
is
good,
and
has
many
villages
full
of
people;
the
land
bears
barley
and
wheat
and
pulse
of
all
sorts,
millet
and
sesame,
figs
enough,
plenty
of
grapes,
good
wine-grapes
too,
and
everything
else
except
olives.
So
much
for
the
country.
They
encamped
on
the
beach
beside
the
sea.
They
would
not
camp
on
a
place
which
might
be
turned
into
a
city,
and
they
thought
indeed
that
they
had
really
been
brought
there
by
some
scheme
of
persons
who
wanted
to
found
a
city.
For
most
of
the
soldiers
had
not
been
driven
by
poverty
to
this
expedition;
but
it
was
the
fame
of
Cyros
which
had
brought
them,
some
had
followers
with
them,
some
had
spent
money
themselves,
and
a
few
others
had
run
away
from
home—they
had
left
father
and
mother,
or
even
children
too,
hoping
to
return
with
wealth
for
them,
since
they
had
heard
how
others
had
made
their
fortunes
with
Cyros,
Men
such
as
these
wished
to
return
safe
to
Hellas.
On
the
next
day
after
this
meeting
Xenophon
made
sacrifice
for
an
expedition,
since
he
must
lead
them
out
for
provisions;
he
intended
also
to
bury
the
dead.
The
omens
were
good;
they
set
out,
and
the
Arcadians
went
with
them.
Most
of
the
dead
they
buried
where
they
fell;
it
was
already
five
days
ago,
and
the
bodies
could
not
be
removed;
others
who
lay
on
the
roads,
however,
they
did
collect,
and
buried
them
with
all
possible
ceremony.
For
those
they
could
not
find
they
made
a
great
cenotaph,
and
laid
garlands
upon
it,
and
then
returned
to
camp.
That
evening
they
supped
and
slept
there.
On
the
next
day
there
was
a
general
meeting
of
the
soldiers,
summoned
chiefly
by
Agasias
the
Stymphalian,
captain,
and
Hieronymos
the
Elean,
captain,
and
certain
others,
the
seniors
of
the
Arcadians.
They
passed
a
resolution,
that
for
the
future
if
anyone
proposed
to
divide
their
army
he
should
be
punished
with
death;
and
now
that
the
army
should
resume
the
arrangement
they
had
before,
and
the
former
captains
be
in
command.
Cheirisophos
was
dead
already,
from
some
medicine
he
took
in
his
fever.
Neon
of
Asine
took
his
place.
After
this
Xenophon
rose
and
spoke.
“Soldiers,”
he
said,
“it
is
clear
that
our
journey
must
be
made
by
land,
for
we
have
no
ships;
and
it
is
necessary
to
march
at
once,
for
if
we
stay
we
have
no
food.
Then
we,”
says
he,
“will
make
sacrifice;
and
you
must
prepare
yourselves
to
fight
now
if
ever
you
did,
for
the
enemy
are
full
of
confidence.”
Then
the
captains
sacrificed;
they
had
a
seer,
Arexion
the
Arcadian,
for
Silanos
the
Ambraciot
was
gone
before
this;
he
had
hired
a
ship
at
Heracleia
and
shown
his
heels.
They
sacrificed
for
departure,
but
the
omens
were
not
good,
so
they
waited
that
day.
Some
persons
made
so
bold
as
to
say
that
Xenophon
wanted
to
found
a
city
there,
and
he
had
persuaded
the
seer
to
declare
the
omens
unfavourable.
Then
on
the
morrow
he
cried
round
the
camp
that
the
sacrifice
was
open
to
all
comers,
and
invited
any
seer
there
might
be
to
come
and
inspect
the
ceremony,
and
then
sacrificed;
great
numbers
were
present.
Sacrifice
was
made
as
many
as
three
times,
and
the
omens
were
unfavourable.
Then
the
soldiers
were
very
angry,
for
the
provisions
they
had
with
them
were
nearly
done,
and
there
was
no
market
yet.
After
this
they
had
a
meeting,
and
Xenophon
said,
“Gentlemen,
for
our
departure,
as
you
see,
the
omens
are
not
yet
favourable;
but
I
see
you
need
provisions,
and
I
think
it
necessary,
then,
to
sacrifice
about
just
that.”
Someone
rose
and
said,
“There
is
good
reason
why
the
omens
are
bad.
I
heard
from
someone
on
board
a
ship
which
came
in
yesterday
by
accident.
Cleandros
the
governor
of
Byzantion
intends
to
come
with
transports
and
ships-of-war!”
Then
they
all
decided
to
stay;
but
the
provisions
had
to
be
got,
and
there
must
be
some
expedition.
Again
he
sacrificed
three
times
for
this,
and
the
omens
were
unfavourable.
Men
were
already
coming
to
Xenophon’s
tent
and
saying
they
had
nothing
to
eat;
but
he
refused
to
lead
them
out
without
good
omens.
Again
he
wanted
to
sacrifice
next
day;
and
almost
the
whole
army
was
crowded
about
the
place,
because
all
were
concerned,
but
no
victims
were
to
be
had.
The
captains
did
not
lead
them
out,
but
summoned
a
meeting.
So
Xenophon
said,
“Perhaps
the
enemy
are
gathered
and
we
shall
have
to
fight.
Then
if
we
leave
the
baggage
in
the
strong
place
up
there
and
go
out
ready
for
battle,
perhaps
the
omens
might
be
good.”
The
soldiers
shouted
out,
“No
need
to
take
us
to
that
place;
sacrifice
and
look
sharp!”
Sheep
still
could
not
be
found,
but
they
brought
an
ox
from
under
a
cart
and
sacrificed;
and
Xenophon
begged
Cleanor
the
Arcadian
to
look
after
it,
in
case
something
was
there.
But
even
so
there
was
nothing
good.
Neon
was
captain
in
place
of
Cheirisophos,
and
when
he
saw
the
men
in
a
miserable
state
from
want,
he
wanted
to
do
them
a
good
turn.
He
found
some
fellow
from
Heracleia,
who
said
he
knew
villages
near
where
they
could
get
their
provisions,
so
he
sent
round
a
herald
to
cry,
“If
anyone
wishes
to
go
for
provisions,
follow
mel”
They
came
out
then,
with
poles
and
skins
and
bags
and
bowls,
two
thousand
of
them.
But
when
they
were
among
the
villages,
and
scattered
to
get
what
they
could,
Pharnabazos’s
cavalry
fell
on
them
first:
they
had
come
to
support
the
Bithynians,
wishing
with
the
Bithynians
to
keep
the
Hellenes
from
entering
Phrygia,
if
they
could.
These
horsemen
killed
no
fewer
than
five
hundred
of
the
men;
the
rest
escaped
to
the
highlands.
One
of
those
who
escaped
brought
the
news
to
the
camp.
Since
the
other
sacrifices
that
day
had
been
unfavourable,
Xenophon
took
a
bullock
from
a
cart
(there
were
no
other
victims)
and
cut
its
throat,
and
went
to
the
rescue
with
all
up
to
thirty
years
of
age.
They
picked
up
the
rest
of
the
party
and
brought
them
back
to
camp.
It
was
already
about
sunset,
and
the
Hellenes
were
supping,
very
miserable,
when
suddenly
out
of
the
brakes
some
Bithynians
attacked
the
outposts,
and
killed
some,
and
drove
the
rest
into
the
camp.
Shouts
and
cries
brought
all
the
Hellenes
running
for
their
arms;
but
to
pursue,
and
to
move
the
camp
at
night,
was
thought
to
be
not
safe,
for
the
place
was
covered
with
bush.
They
spent
the
night
under
arms,
with
sufficient
outposts
to
keep
watch.
6.5
So
they
spent
the
night;
and
at
daybreak
the
captains
led
them
to
the
strong
place.
They
followed
with
arms
and
baggage.
Before
the
time
of
breakfast,
they
dug
a
ditch
across
the
entry
into
the
stronghold,
and
fenced
all
in
with
stakes,
leaving
three
gates.
A
ship
arrived
from
Heracleia,
bringing
barley-meal
and
wine
and
sacrificial
victims.
Xenophon
rose
early,
and
sacrificed
for
an
expedition,
and
had
good
omens
in
the
first
victim.
And
just
at
the
end
of
the
sacrifice,
the
seer
Arexion
the
Parrhasian
spied
an
eagle,
and
told
Xenophon
to
lead
on.
They
crossed
the
trench
and
grounded
arms,
and
sent
round
a
herald
with
orders
that
the
men
should
breakfast
and
then
come
out
under
arms;
the
mob
and
the
captives
to
be
left
there.
All
came
except
Neon,
for
it
seemed
best
to
leave
him
on
guard
in
the
camp;
but
his
officers
and
men
began
to
desert
him,
being
ashamed
not
to
follow
when
the
others
went
out,
and
all
over
forty-five
years
of
age
in
the
army
were
sent
back
to
him.
These
remained,
then,
and
the
rest
marched
out.
Before
they
had
gone
two
miles
they
came
on
dead
bodies;
and
when
they
brought
up
the
rear
of
their
division
level
with
the
first
bodies
found,
they
buried
all
covered
by
the
division.
Having
buried
the
first
ones,
they
pushed
on
until
the
rear
was
level
with
the
first
of
the
unburied,
and
then
buried
in
the
same
way
all
that
the
army
covered.
But
when
they
reached
the
road
from
the
villages,
where
they
lay
in
heaps,
they
collected
them
and
buried
them
together.
Tt
was
now
past
midday;
they
still
led
the
army
forward
but
outside
the
villages,
and
seized
all
they
set
eyes
on
within
the
line,
when
suddenly
they
beheld
the
enemy
coming
over
the
crest
of
some
hills
opposite,
and
marshalled
in
line
of
battle,
large
numbers
of
horse
and
foot;
for
Spithridates
and
Rhathines
were
there
from
Pharnabazos
with
their
forces.
When
the
enemy
caught
sight
of
the
Hellenes
they
halted
about
two
miles
off.
At
once
Arexion
the
Hellenic
seer
sacrificed,
and
in
the
very
first
victim
the
omens
were
good.
Then
Xenophon
said,
“I
propose,
gentlemen,
to
appoint
reserve
companies
for
the
line,
so
that
in
case
of
need
there
will
be
troops
to
support,
and
when
the
enemy
are
in
some
disorder
they
may
meet
opponents
in
good
order
and
fresh.”
All
approved
this.
“Advance,
then,”
said
he,
“straight
on
our
foes.
Don’t
let
us
stand
still,
now
we
have
seen
them
and
they
have
seen
us.
I
will
detach
the
last
companies,
as
you
have
approved,
and
come
on.”
After
this
the
main
body
advanced
quietly,
and
he
detached
the
three
rear
sections,
two
hundred
men
each.
He
sent
one
to
the
right,
ordering
it
to
follow
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
feet:
Samolas
the
Achaian
was
in
command
of
this
section.
The
second
he
placed
in
the
centre;
Pyrrhias
the
Arcadian
was
in
command
here.
The
other
one
he
placed
on
the
left,
in
command
of
Phrasias
the
Athenian.
On
the
way
the
leading
party
came
to
a
ravine,
a
deep,
difficult
place,
and
they
stood
doubtful
whether
they
should
cross
it.
Word
was
sent
back
calling
officers
and
captains
to
the
front.
Xenophon
wondered
what
the
check
could
be,
and
soon
hearing
the
summons
he
rode
forward
at
full
speed.
When
they
met,
Sophainetos
the
senior
captain
said
the
question
was
not
worth
discussing,
whether
they
ought
to
cross
a
ravine
like
that.
Xenophon
broke
in
firmly
and
said:
“You
know,
gentlemen,
that
I
have
never
urged
you
to
any
danger
if
I
had
the
choice.
You
need
no
reputation
for
courage,
as
I
can
see;
it’s
life
or
death
now!
Without
fighting
we
cannot
get
out
of
this;
if
we
do
not
attack,
the
enemy
will
follow
whenever
we
retreat,
and
fall
on
us.
Think,
then,
whether
it
is
better
to
go
for
the
enemy
with
arms
in
front,
or
reverse
arms
and
watch
him
following
behind!
You
know,
moreover,
that
to
retreat
before
the
enemy
is
not
for
a
man
of
honour,
but
to
attack
makes
even
a
coward
bold.
I
would
rather
myself
attack
with
half
this
number
than
retreat
with
double
the
number!
“As
for
these
men—I
know
you
expect
yourselves
that
they
will
not
stand
before
us,
but
if
we
retreat
we
all
know
they
will
dare
to
follow.
And
to
cross,
leaving
a
difficult
ravine
behind
us,
when
we
are
going
to
fight,
is
surely
an
advantage
worth
taking!
For
the
enemy,
I
should
like
to
give
every
opportunity
to
retreat;
for
us,
the
ground
itself
ought
to
teach
us
that
only
victory
can
give
safety.
I’m
really
surprised
if
anyone
thinks
this
ravine
more
terrible
than
the
other
places
we
have
passed.
How
can
that
plain
be
passed
if
we
do
not
beat
the
cavalry?
Or
the
mountains
which
we
have
passed,
if
all
those
light
troops
are
following?
And
suppose
we
do
get
safe
to
the
sea,
what
a
huge
ravine
is
the
Euxine!
No
ships
are
there
to
carry
us,
no
food
if
we
stay
there,
and
no
sooner
shall
we
be
there
than
we
shall
have
to
sally
in
search
of
provisions!
Surely
it
is
better
to
fight
now
to-day
after
a
good
breakfast
than
to-morrow
after
none
at
all!
Men,
the
victims
are
favourable,
the
omens
are
good,
the
sacrifice
excellent—let
us
go
for
them!
Now
they
have
seen
us
at
all,
these
men
must
not
be
left
to
dine
comfortably
and
camp
where
they
will!”
Then
the
captains
told
him
to
lead
on,
and
no-one
objected.
So
he
led
on,
giving
orders
for
each
man
to
cross
where
he
found
himself;
he
thought
the
army
would
get
over
more
quickly
all
together,
than
filing
by
the
bridge
like
a
skein
of
wool
where
it
spanned
the
valley.
As
soon
as
they
had
crossed
he
went
along
the
line
and
spoke
to
them:
“Men,”
he
said,
“remember
how
many
battles
you
have
won,
with
God’s
help,
by
coming
to
handgrips!
Renrember
what
happens
to
those
who
run
before
their
foes!
Do
not
forget
that
we
stand
at
the
door
of
Hellas.
Follow
Leader
Heracles
and
cheer
on
each
other
by
name.
What
a
delight
now
to
say
and
do
something
honourable
and
brave,
and
to
leave
such
a
memory
of
ourselves
with
those
whom
we
wish
to
remember
us!”
So
he
exhorted
them,
riding
along,
and
he
began
to
lead
them
himself
in
line
of
battle.
They
posted
the
targeteers
on
each
flank,
and
marched
for
the
enemy.
The
order
was
to
hold
spears
on
the
right
shoulder
until
the
trumpet
sounded,
then
drop
them
to
the
charge
and
march
forward
steadily,
no-one
to
double.
Then
the
watchword
went
round,
Zeus
Saviour,
Heracles
Leader!
The
enemy
stood
their
ground,
thinking
they
had
a
good
position.
When
the
Hellenes
were
close
up,
with
a
cheer
the
targeteers
doubled
to
the
attack
without
orders;
the
enemy
came
out
to
meet
them,
both
cayalry
and
a
mass
of
Bithynians,
and
drove
back
the
light
troops.
But
when
the
line
of
heavy-armed
men
came
up
marching
fast
the
trumpet
sounded
at
once,
they
chanted
their
hymn,
and
cheered
Eleleu!
and
at
once
down
came
the
spears:
then
the
enemy
stood
no
longer
but
broke
into
flight.
Timasion
with
his
horsemen
gave
chase,
and
killed
all
they
could,
a
few
men
like
that.
The
enemy
left
wing
was
dispersed
at
once,
where
the
Hellenic
horsemen
were;
but
the
right
wing,
being
not
vigorously
pursued,
rallied
upon
a
hill.
As
soon
as
the
Hellenes
saw
them
making
a
stand
they
thought
the
easiest
and
safest
thing
was
to
charge
them,
and
charge
they
did,
chanting
the
battle-hymn.
Then
they
stood
no
longer;
the
targeteers
pursued
until
the
right
wing
was
scattered,
but
few
were
killed,
for
the
enemy
cavalry
was
formidable,
being
a
large
body.
The
Hellenes
could
see
the
horse
of
Pharnabazos
in
formation
still,
and
the
Bithynian
horse
rallying
to
these,
and
watching
the
scene
from
a
hill;
tired
as
they
were,
they
determined
to
attack
them
as
best
they
could,
and
not
to
let
them
recover
their
spirits
and
rest.
So
they
formed
up
and
marched.
Then
the
enemy
horse
took
flight
down
the
steep
just
as
if
cavalry
were
pursuing.
A
valley
received
them
which
the
Hellenes
had
not
noticed,
and
they
gave
up
the
pursuit,
for
it
was
late.
So
they
returned
to
the
place
where
the
first
encounter
had
been;
and
putting
up
a
trophy,
they
set
out
for
the
sea
about
sunset:
it
was
about
seven
miles
to
the
camp.
6.6
After
this
the
enemy
kept
to
themselves,
and
brought
away
the
inhabitants
and
their
goods
as
far
as
possible;
but
the
Hellenes
waited
for
Cleandros
and
the
transports
and
ships
of
war
which
they
expected,
Each
day
they
sallied
out
with
animals
and
slaves,
and
brought
in
plenty
of
wheat
and
barley,
wine,
vegetables,
millet,
and
figs,
for
the
country
had
all
good
things
except
olive
oil.
When
the
army
remained
to
rest
anyone
had
leave
to
raid
for
booty,
and
those
who
raided
kept
what
they
got;
but
whenever
the
army
went
on
some
expedition
together,
if
any
one
got
private
spoil
it
was
put
in
the
common
stock.
Now
there
was
plenty
of
everything;
markets
were
provided
from
all
sides
by
the
Hellenic
cities,
and
ships
coasting
by
gladly
put
in,
hearing
there
was
a
city
with
people
in
it
and
a
harbour,
The
enemy
also
thereabouts
sent
to
Xenophon,
hearing
that
he
was
making
a
city
in
the
place,
to
ask
what
they
could
do
to
be
friends,
He
referred
them
to
the
soldiers.
Meanwhile
Cleandros
arrived,
with
two
ships-of-war
but
no
transports,
to
find
the
camp
empty,
the
main
body
of
the
army
being
away.
Some
of
the
troops
had
gone
into
the
hills
foraging
and
captured
a
number
of
sheep;
they
were
afraid
that
these
might
be
taken
away,
and
told
Dexippos,
the
man
who
had
shown
a
clean
pair
of
heels
from
Trapezûs
with
the
fifty-oar
galley.
They
said
he
might
take
some
if
he
left
them
the
rest.
At
once
he
drove
off
the
soldiers
standing
round
and
saying
they
were
public
property;
Dexippos
informed
Cleandros
that
this
was
an
attempt
at
robbery.
Cleandros
told
him
to
bring
the
robber,
and
he
caught
someone
and
brought
him.
Agasias
met
him
and
rescued
the
man,
who
belonged
to
his
company.
The
other
soldiers
there
began
to
pelt
stones
at
Dexippos,
calling
out
“Traitor!”
Many
of
the
naval
men
ran
off
to
the
sea
in
fear,
and
Cleandros
ran
too,
Xenophon
and
the
captains
put
a
stop
to
this,
and
told
Cleandros
that
there
was
nothing
in
it,
the
general
rule
in
the
army
was
the
reason.
But
Cleandros
allowed
himself
to
be
goaded
on
by
Dexippos,
and
he
was
angry
too
for
having
been
frightened;
he
said
he
would
sail
away,
and
declare
them
public
enemies,
and
forbid
all
cities
to
receive
them.
At
that
time
the
Lacedaimonians
were
the
leading
state
in
Hellas.
The
matter
began
to
look
ugly,
and
the
Hellenes
begged
him
not
to
do
so.
He
said
he
was
resolved
unless
they
delivered
over
to
him
the
robber
and
the
man
who
began
stoning.
Agasias
was
one
of
the
men
he
demanded,
and
he
was
always
Xenophon’s
friend;
that
was
why
Dexippos
denounced
him.
In
this
difficulty
the
commanders
called
all
to
a
meeting.
Some
of
them
made
light
of
Cleandros;
but
Xenophon
did
not
think
it
a
trifling
matter,
and
he
rose
and
spoke.
“Soldiers
and
gentlemen,
I
think
it
no
trifling
matter
if
Cleandros
is
to
leave
us
with
this
intention
as
he
declares.
The
Hellenic
cities
are
close
at
hand,
and
the
Lacedaimonians
are
at
the
head
of
Hellas.
They
are
able,
and
any
one
of
them
is
able,
to
arrange
what
they
will
in
the
cities.
If
he
first
closes
Byzantion
against
us,
and
then
forbids
the
other
governors
to
receive
us,
as
public
enemies
to
Lacedaimon
and
lawless
men,
and
if
this
reputation
comes
to
Admiral
Anaxibios,
it
will
be
difficult
either
to
go
or
to
stay:
on
land
the
Lacedaimonians
are
masters,
and
so
they
are
at
sea
now.
Then
we
must
not
shut
all
of
us
out
of
Hellas
for
the
sake
of
one
man,
or
two;
no,
we
must
obey
whatever
they
command,
for
even
the
cities
we
come
from
obey
them.
I
take
it
on
myself,
then;
for
I
hear
Dexippos
has
told
Clearchos
that
Agasias
would
never
have
done
this
unless
I
had
commanded
him.
I
clear
you
all,
then,
from
the
charge,
and
Agasias
too,
if
Agasias
himself
says
I
am
to
blame;
and
I
condemn
myself,
if
I
am
the
inciter
of
stoning
or
any
other
violence,
to
be
worthy
of
the
extreme
penalty,
and
I
will
face
the
penalty.
I
say
also
that
if
he
accuses
anyone
else,
he
must
give
himself
up
to
Cleandros
for
judgment;
thus
you
will
all
be
free
of
the
charge.
But
as
things
are
now
it
is
hard
if
we
are
to
be
thought
not
even
equal
to
others,
instead
of
winning
praise
and
honour
in
Hellas,
and
if
we
are
to
be
excluded
from
all
Hellenic
cities.”
After
this
Agasias
rose
and
spoke.
“I
take
my
oath,
gentlemen,
by
all
gods
and
goddesses,
that
Xenophon
did
not
command
me
to
rescue
the
man,
and
no-one
else
did
command
me.
I
saw
an
honest
man
of
my
company
being
dragged
away
by
Dexippos,
one
who
was
traitor
to
you
as
you
know,
and
I
thought
it
a
shame
and
rescued
him,
I
admit.
You
need
not
surrender
me;
I
will
surrender
myself,
as
Xenophon
says,
to
Cleandros,
that
he
may
judge
me
as
he
shall
please.
Don’t
make
war
on
Lacedaimonians
for
that,
but
go
safely
with
your
lives
where
each
one
shall
wish.
However,
elect
some
of
yourselves
and
send
them
with
me
to
Cleandros,
to
speak
and
act
on
my
behalf
if
I
omit
anything.”
Then
the
army
left
it
to
him
to
choose
any
he
wished,
and
he
chose
the
captains.
After
this
they
went
before
Cleandros,
Agasias
and
the
captains
and
the
man
whom
Agasias
had
rescued.
The
captains
spoke
and
said:
“We
have
been
sent
by
the
army
to
you,
Cleandros.
If
you
accuse
all,
they
ask
you
to
be
judge
yourself
and
do
to
us
all
what
you
think
best;
or
if
you
accuse
one,
or
two,
or
more,
they
expect
these
to
surrender
themselves
to
you
for
judgment.
Then
if
you
accuse
any
of
us
in
any
point,
we
are
here
before
you;
if
anyone
else,
tell
us
who;
no-one
shall
be
absent
who
will
obey
us.”
Next
Agasias
stept
forward:
“I
am
the
man,
Cleandros,”
he
said,
“who
rescued
that
man
from
the
hands
of
Dexippos,
and
gave
the
order
to
strike
Dexippos.
For
the
man,
I
know,
is
an
honest
man;
and
Dexi
ppos,
I
know,
was
elected
by
the
army
to
command
that
fifty-oar
galley
which
we
borrowed
from
the
Trapezuntians
to
collect
transports
for
our
rescue,
and
I
know
Dexippos
absconded
and
betrayed
the
soldiers
with
whose
help
he
had
been
saved
alive:
so
we
robbed
Trapezûs
of
the
fifty-oar
galley
and
we
got
a
bad
name
on
his
account,
and
he
has
destroyed
us
as
far
as
his
own
part
goes.
For
he
heard,
as
we
did,
that
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
march.
by
land
and
cross
those
rivers
and
come
home
safe
to
Hellas.
Such
is
the
man
whom
I
robbed
of
his
prey.
If
you
had
seized
him,
or
any
from
you,
not
a
deserter
from
ourselves,
I
assure
you
that
I
would
have
done
none
of
these
things.
Then
if
you
put
me
to
death
now,
be
assured
that
you
are
executing
an
honest
man
for
a
coward
and
a
criminal.”
Cleandros
heard
them,
and
said
that
he
could
not
commend
Dexippos
if
he
had
done
that;
but
he
did
not
consider
that
violence
ought
to
be
offered
to
Dexippos,
however
bad
he
might
be.
“He
ought
to
be
tried
and
judged,”
he
said,
“as
you
claim
yourselves,
before
punishment.
Then
leave
this
man
with
me
now,
and
go;
and
when
I
command
you,
present
yourselves
at
the
judgment.
I
accuse
neither
the
army
nor
anyone
else
further,
now
that
this
man
himself
admits
that
he
rescued
the
man.”
The
rescued
man
said,
“Let
me
speak,
sir,
for
myself;
if
you
think
I
had
done
any
wrong
that
I
should
be
arrested,
I
struck
no-one,
I
cast
no
stone,
I
only
said
the
sheep
were
public
property;
for
it
was
a
general
rule
in
the
army
that
when
the
army
was
raiding,
if
anyone
got
private
spoil,
what
he
took
was
public
property.
That
is
all
I
said;
and
immediately
this
man
arrested
me
and
began
to
hale
me
off;
in
order
that
no-one
might
utter
a
word,
but
he
might
take
some
for
himself
and
keep
the
rest
for
the
robbers
contrary
to
the
rule.”
Cleandros
answered,
“Then
you
stay
too,
since
you
say
that,
and
we
will
consider
your
case
also.”
After
this,
Cleandros
and
his
people
had
breakfast,
and
Xenophon
summoned
the
army
to
meet,
and
advised
them
to
send
a
deputation
to
Cleandros
and
ask
mercy
for
the
men.
Accordingly
it
was
decided
to
send
captains
and
officers,
with
Dracontios
the
Spartan
noble,
and
others
who
seemed
appropriate,
and
petition
Cleandros
to
release
the
two
men.
So
Xenophon
came
before
him,
and
said:
“Now,
Cleandros,
you
have
the
men;
the
army
has
yielded
to
your
will,
both
in
this
and
in
all
else.
Now
they
beg
and
pray
you
to
give
up
the
two
men
and
not
to
put
them
to
death;
for
they
have
served
the
army
well
in
time
past.
If
you
grant
this,
they
promise
for
the
future,
if
you
will
lead
them
and
if
the
gods
are
gracious,
to
show
you
how
orderly
they
are,
and
how
well
fitted
to
fear
no
enemy,
with
heaven’s
help,
while
they
obey
their
commander.
They
pray
this
also,
that
you
will
come
and
take
command
of
them,
test
them
and
Dexippos
too,
and
find
out
what
each
is
like,
and
then
give
each
man
his
due.”
Cleandros
listened,
and
said,
“Now
be
the
twa
gads,”
The
Spartan
oath,
by
Castor
and
Polydeuces.
In
the
Spartan
dialect.
says
he,
“Tll
soon
answer
you
that.
Take
the
two
men
as
a
gift,
and
I
will
come
too,
and
if
God
grants
it
I
will
lead
you
all
home
to
Hellas.
This
is
a
very
different
tale
from
what
I
heard
from
some
people,
that
your
whole
army
was
apostate
from
the
Lacedaimonians.”
Then
they
thanked
him
and
went
away
with
the
two
men.
Cleandros
made
sacrifice
for
the
journey,
and
was
most
cordial
with
Xenophon,
and
they
struck
up
a
friendship
together.
When
he
saw
them
obeying
orders
punctiliously,
he
wished
more
than
ever
to
be
their
leader.
However,
after
he
sacrificed
on
three
days
and
found
no
good
omens,
he
summoned
the
captains,
and
said,
“I
can’t
get
omens
for
myself
to
take
you
away,
but
don’t
lose
heart
on
account
of
that.
You,
it
seems,
are
decreed
to
be
the
leaders;
then
go
ahead.
And
when
you
come
to
your
journey’s
end,
we
will
entertain
you
as
handsomely
as
we
can.”
Upon
this
they
resolved
to
give
over
the
public
sheep
to
him,
and
he
gave
them
back.
Then
he
set
sail;
and
the
soldiers
divided
up
the
corn
they
had
collected,
and
their
other
spoils,
and
set
out
through
the
Bithynian
country.
They
followed
the
main
road
for
some
time;
but
finding
no
means
of
putting
something
in
their
pockets
before
they
came
into
a
friendly
land,
they
turned
right
about
and
marched
for
a
day
and
a
night
in
the
opposite
direction.
By
doing
this
they
captured
many
slaves
and
much
cattle,
and
in
six
days
they
reached
Chrysopolis
in
Calchedonia,
and
there
they
stayed
seven
days
selling
their
spoil.
BOOK
SEVEN
7.1
After
this
Pharnabazos
was
afraid
that
the
army
might
march
into
his
country;
so
he
sent
to
Admiral
Anaxibios,
who
was
in
Byzantion
as
it
happened,
and
begged
him
to
transport
the
army
out
of
Asia,
promising
to
do
all
that
was
necessary.
Anaxibios
summoned
the
captains
and
officers
to
Byzantion,
and
promised
service
and
pay
for
the
soldiers
if
they
would
cross.
Most
of
them
said
they
would
discuss
it
and
return
an
answer,
but
Xenophon
replied
to
him
that
he
wished
to
leave
the
army
at
once
and
sail.
Anaxibios
asked
him
to
wait
and
cross
with
the
rest,
and
he
said
he
would.
Now
Seuthes
the
Thracian
sent
Medodases
to
Xenophon,
and
asked
him
to
do
his
best
to
get
the
army
across,
and
said
if
he
did
he
should
not
be
sorry
for
it.
Xenophon
replied,
“The
army
will
cross
in
any
case;
for
that,
let
him
pay
nothing
to
me
or
to
anyone.
But
as
soon
as
it
has
gone
across,
I
shall
take
my
leave;
let
him
deal
as
far
as
he
thinks
safe
with
those
who
remain
and
appear
most
important.”
Soon
all
the
soldiers
had
crossed
over
to
Byzantion.
Anaxi-
bios
did
not
find
pay
for
the
men,
but
made
proclamation
that
all
were
to
take
their
arms
and
baggage
and
go,
as
if
all
he
wanted.
was
to
count
them
and
give
them
a
send-off.
Then
the
soldiers
were
indignant,
because
they
had
not
money
to
pay
for
their
food
on
the
way,
and
they
took
their
time
about
packing.
But
Xenophon
went
to
pay
a
parting
visit
to
Cleandros
the
governor,
with
whom
he
had
made
friendship
as
has
been
described;
and
he
said,
“Don’t
go
now,
or
else,”
says
he,
“you
will
be
blamed.
Even
now
some
find
fault
with
you
because
the
army
will
not
clear
out
quickly.”
He
answered,
“I
can’t
help
that.
The
men
themselves
want
money
to
pay
for
their
keep,
and
that’s
why
they
are
so
slack
about
going.”
“All
the
same,”
says
he,
“I
advise
you
to
leave
as
if
you
meant
to
go,
and
as
soon
as
the
army
is
outside
get
away
from
them.”
“Well,
then,”
said
Xenophon,
“let’s
go
and
arrange
that
with
Anaxibios.”
So
they
went
and
told
him.
He
said
that
was
what
they
should
do;
let
them
pack
up
and
march
out
by
the
quickest
road,
and
he
added
that
whoever
was
not
present
at
the
review
must
take
the
consequences.
Then
out
they
went,
the
captains
first
and
the
others
after;
it
was
a
clean
sweep
of
all
but
a
few;
and
Eteonicos
stood
by
the
gates,
to
close
the
gates
and
fix
the
bar
as
soon
as
all
were
outside.
Anaxibios
summoned
captains
and
officers,
and
said,
“Provisions,”
says
he,
“you
will
find
in
the
Thracian
villages;
there
is
plenty
of
barley
and
wheat
there,
and
everything
else.
Take
it
and
march
to
the
Chersonese,
and
there
Cyniscos
will
give
you
pay.”
Some
of
the
men
heard
this,
or
else
one
of
the
captains
informed
the
army.
The
captains
inquired
about
Seuthes,
whether
he
was
friend
or
enemy,
and
whether
they
must
go
by
the
Holy
Mountain
of
Athos,
or
round
through
the
middle
of
Thrace.
While
they
were
talking,
some
of
the
men
caught
up
their
arms
and
set
off
at
a
run
for
the
gates,
intending
to
get
within
the
walls
again.
Eteonicos
and
his
party
saw
the
heavy
troops
running
for
the
gates,
and
closed
them
at
once
and
threw
in
the
bar.
The
men
began
battering
the
gates,
and
called
out
it
was
a
shame
to
throw
them
out
amongst
the
enemy;
said
they
would
smash
the
gates
unless
they
would
open
them
from
inside.
Others
rushed
down
to
the
sea,
and
climbed
by
the
breakwater
over
the
wall
into
the
city;
others
of
the
soldiers
who
were
within,
seeing
this
business
at
the
gates,
cut
the
bars
with
their
axes
and
flung
the
gates
open,
and
in
they
all
came.
Xenophon
saw
all
this;
and
fearing
that
the
army
might
turn
to
pillage,
and
incurable
trouble
might
follow
for
the
city
and
for
himself
and
the
soldiers,
ran
and
got
through
the
gates
along
with
the
mob.
When
the
townspeople
saw
the
army
breaking
in,
they
fled
from
the
market,
some
home,
some
to
boats
and
ships;
all
that
happened
to
be
indoors
ran
out,
some
launched
the
ships-of-war,
hoping
for
safety
in
them,
and
all
believed
themselves
to
be
lost
as
if
the
city
had
been
taken
by
storm.
Eteonicos
took
refuge
in
the
citadel.
Anaxibios
ran
down
to
the
sea,
and
sailed
round
in
a
fishing-boat
to
the
acropolis,
and
at
once
sent
across
for
the
garrison
from
Calchedon,
since
the
men
in
the
acropolis
did
not
seem
strong
enough
to
keep
them
off.
When
the
soldiers
caught
sight
of
Xenophon,
a
number
threw
themselves
upon
him,
crying
out,
“Now
be
a
man,
Xenophon!
Now’s
your
chance!
You
have
a
city,
you
have
ships-of-war,
you
have
money,
you
have
all
these
men!
Now,
if
you
wish,
you
can
help
us,
and
we
can
make
you
great!”
He
answered,
“Well
said,
I’ll
do
it.
If
that
is
what
you
want,
ground
arms
and
form
up
at
once.”
He
wished
to
quiet
them,
so
he
passed
the
word
along
himself,
and
told
them
to
pass
it
on
to
the
others,
Ground
arms.
They
arranged
themselves
in
order;
the
heavy-armed
were
formed
eight
deep
in
a
short
time,
and
the
light-armed
ran
to
each
wing.
The
place
is
excellent
for
drill,
what
is
called
the
Thracian
Square,
being
open
and
bare
of
houses.
When
the
arms
were
grounded
and
they
were
quiet,
Xenophon
called
them
to
meeting
and
spoke.
“You
are
angry,”
said
he,
“soldiers
and
gentlemen,
and
you
think
it
a
great
shame
to
be
deceived;
and
I
am
not
surprised.
But
if
you
indulge
your
tempers,
and
punish
these
Lacedaimonians
here
for
the
deceit,
and
sack
the
city
which
is
not
to
blame,
think
what
will
be
the
result.
We
shall
be
proved
enemies
to
the
Lacedaimonians
and
their
allies.
What
the
war
will
be
like
you
may
guess,
when
you
remember
recent
events
which
you
have
seen.
“We
Athenians
began
war
against
the
Lacedaimonians
and
their
allies
when
we
had
fleets
at
sea
or
in
the
dockyards
of
not
less
than
three
hundred
ships,
when
we
had
great
store
of
wealth
in
the
city,
and
yearly
income
from
our
own
people
and
from
foreign
parts
of
not
less
than
one
thousand
talents.
We
had
command
of
all
the
islands,
we
held
many
cities
in
Asia
and
others
in
Europe,
including
this
very
Byzantion
where
we
now
are.
All
this
we
had,
and
fought
the
war,
with
the
result
which
you
all
know,
Then
what
do
we
expect
to
happen
now,
when
the
Lacedaimonians
have
all
their
old
allies,
and
they
have
added
the
Athenians
and
all
who
then
were
their
allies
too,
when
Tissaphernes
and
the
other
barbarians
on
the
sea
are
all
our
enemies;
and
bitterest
enemy
of
all
the
Great
King
up
country,
whom
we
came
to
kill
and
deprive
of
his
empire
if
we
could!
With
all
these
combined
together,
is
any
of
you
so
foolish
as
to
think
we
can
prevail?
Don’t
let
us
be
mad,
in
God’s
name!
Don’t
let
us
perish
dishonourably,
the
enemies
of
our
own
countries,
yes,
and
our
friends
and
relations!
They
are
all
in
those
cities
which
will
fight
against
us.
And
they
will
be
right
to
do
so,
when
we
refused
to
hold
one
barbarian
city
when
we
had
the
power,
if
we
are
to
sack
the
first
Hellenic
city
we
reach!
“Indeed
I
pray
to
heaven
that
I
may
lie
ten
thousand
fathoms
underground
before
I
see
you
doing
that!
I
advise
you
as
Hellenes
to
try
to
get
your
just
rights
while
still
in
obedience
to
the
rulers
of
the
Hellenes.
If
you
fail
in
this
we
must
bear
our
wrongs,
but
never
shut
ourselves
out
of
Hellas.
Now,
then,
I
think
it
is
our
duty
to
send
a
deputation
to
Anaxibios,
and
tell
him
that
we
have
come
back
into
the
city
not
meaning
to
do
violence
of
any
sort
but
hoping
to
be
relieved
a
little
by
them;
we
will
make
it
plain,
however,
that
we
go,
not
deceived,
but
obedient.”
This
was
agreed;
and
they
sent
with
this
message
Hieronymos
the
Elean
and
Eurylochos
the
Arcadian
and
Philesios
the
Achaian.
The
men
went
with
their
message.
While
the
soldiers
were
still
in
session,
a
certain
Coiratadas
arrived;
he
was
a
Theban
on
his
travels,
not
a
banished
man
but
one
with
a
fever
for
generaleering,
ready
with
his
services
if
army,
city,
or
nation
wanted
a
good
commander.
He
came
and
said
he
was
ready
to
lead
them
to
what
is
called
the
Delta
of
Thrace,
where
they
could
get
all
sorts
of
good
things;
until
they
got
there,
he
would
find
plenty
of
food
and
drink.
While
he
was.
speaking,
the
answer
came
from
Anaxibios:
that
if
they
were
obedient
they
should
never
be
sorry
for
it;
he
would
report
it
to
the
authorities
at
home,
and
he
would
himself
do
all
he
could
for
them.
Accordingly,
the
soldiers
accepted
Coiratadas
for
their
general,
and
went
outside
the
walls.
Coiratadas
arranged
to
be
there
the
next
day
with
victims
for
sacrifice,
and
a
seer,
and
food
and
drink
for
the
army.
When
they
were
outside,
Anaxibios
closed
the
gates
and
proclaimed
that
any
soldier
caught
inside
would
be
sold
as
a
slave.
Next
day
Coiratadas
appeared
with
his
victims
and
seer,
followed
by
twenty
men
bringing
barley
meal
and
twenty
more
with
wine,
three
with
olives,
and
one
with
the
biggest
load
of
garlic
he
could
carry,
and
another
with
onions.
He
dumped
these
down
for
distribution,
and
went
on
with
the
sacrifice.
Xenophon
sent
for
Cleandros,
and
asked
him
to
manage
how
he
might
come
within
the
walls
and
sail
from
Byzantion.
Cleandros
came
and
said,
“What
a
job
I
had
to
arrange
it!
Anaxibios
says
it
is
not
convenient;
that
the
soldiers
are
close
by
the
walls,
and
Xenophon
inside;
the
Byzantines
are
all
factions
quarrelling
with
each
other;
however,
he
says
you
may
come
in
if
you
are
to
sail
with
him.”
Accordingly
Xenophon
said
goodbye
to
the
soldiers,
and
went
in
with
Cleandros.
But
Coiratadas
on
the
first
day
had
no
good
omens,
and
gave
nothing
to
the
soldiers.
On
the
second
day
the
victims
were
standing
by
the
altar
and
Coiratadas
with
a
garland
on
ready
to
sacrifice,
when
up
came
Timasion
the
Dardanian
and
Neon
the
Asinonian
and
Cleanor
the
Archomenian,
and
told
Coiratadas
not
to
sacrifice,
for
he
should
not
be
their
general
unless
he
would
give
them
something
to
eat.
“All
right,”
he
said,
“dole
out.”
But
finding
that
there
was
not
nearly
enough
for
a
day’s
food
all
round,
he
picked
up
his
victims
and
departed.
He
said
he
did
not
care
to
be
general.
7.2
Neon
of
Asine
and
the
Achaians
Phryniscos
and
Philesios
and
Xanthicles,
and
Timasion
the
Dardanian,
remained
in
charge
of
the
army,
and
they
encamped
among
the
villages
near
Byzantion.
Then
the
captains
quarrelled.
Cleanor
and
Phryniscos
wanted
to
march
to
Seuthes,
a
Thracian
king
who
had
persuaded
them
by
giving
a
horse
to
one
and
a
woman
to
the
other.
Neon
voted
for
the
Chersonese,
believing
that
if
they
came
under
Lacedaimonians,
he
would
be
put
at
the
head
of
the
whole
army.
Timasion
was
eager
to
go
over
to
Asia
again,
hoping
to
return
home;
the
soldiers
wanted
the
same.
Time
was
wasted,
and
many
of
the
soldiers
dispersed,
some
selling
their
arms
here
or
there
and
taking
ship
where
they
could,
some
joining
the
cities.
Anaxibios
was
glad
to
hear
all
this,
how
the
army
was
dwindling;
that’s
the
best
way
to
please
Pharnabazos,
he
thought.
Anaxibios
on
his
voyage
from
Byzantion
was
met
in
Cyzicos
by
Aristarchos,
who
was
to
succeed
Cleandros
as
governor
of
Byzantion;
it
was
said
also
that
his
own
successor,
Polos,
was
all
but
in
the
Hellespont
by
this
time.
Anaxibios
instructed
Aristarchos
to
sell
as
slaves
any
of
Cyros’s
men
he
might
find
left;
but
Cleandros
sold
none,
he
even
cared
for
the
sick
and
made
people
take
them
in.
But
Aristarchos,
when
he
came,
did
sell
as
many
as
four
hundred.
Anaxibios,
coming
to
Parion
in
his
voyage,
sent
a
message
to
Pharnabazos
as
had
been
arranged.
However,
Pharnabazos
cared
nothing
for
Anaxibios,
when
he
was
no
longer
admiral;
but
as
soon
as
he
learnt
that
Aristarchos
had
arrived
at
Byzantion
to
be
governor,
he
made
the
same
arrangements
with
him
about
Cyros’s
army
as
he
had
made
with
Anaxibios.
Consequently
Anaxibios
called
Xenophon,
and
begged
him
by
every
manner
of
means
to
sail
with
all
haste
to
the
army,
to
gather
and
hold
together
as
many
of
the
scattered
men
as
he
possibly
could,
to
bring
them
down
to
Perinthos
and
across
into
Asia
with
all
speed;
he
gave
him
a
fifty-oar
galley
and
a
letter,
and
sent
a
man
with
him
to
order
the
Perinthinas
to
supply
Xenophon
with
horses
and
to
escort
him
as
far
as
the
army.
Xenophon
sailed
over
and
reached
the
army;
the
soldiers
received
him
with
delight
and
followed
him
gladly,
ready
to
cross
from
Thrace
into
Asia.
Seuthes
heard
of
this,
and
again
sent
Medosades
to
him
by
sea,
and
begged
him
to
lead
the
army
to
himself,
promising
him
what
he
thought
would
persuade
him;
but
he
answered
that
none
of
these
things
could
be
done.
The
messenger
departed.
When
the
Hellenes
arrived
at
Perinthos,
Neon
broke
away
and
encamped
apart
about
with
eight
hundred
men;
all
the
rest
of
the
army
was
in
one
place
beside
the
walls
of
Perinthos.
Next
Xenophon
began
to
arrange
for
vessels
to
transport
them
across
with
all
speed.
Meanwhile
Aristarchos
arrived,
the
governor
of
Byzantion,
with
two
ships-of-war
(Pharnabazos
was
at
the
bottom
of
this).
He
forbade
the
skippers
to
take
them
aboard;
and
he
came
to
the
army
and
forbade
the
soldiers
to
cross
into
Asia.
Xenophon
said,
“These
are
orders
from
Anaxibios,
and
he
sent
me
here
for
this.”
Aristarchos
again
said,
“Well,
Anaxibios
is
no
longer
admiral,
and
I
am
governor
here.
If
I
catch
any
of
you
at
sea,
I
will
sink
you.”
With
these
words
he
went
back
to
his
walls.
Next
day
he
sent
for
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
army.
When
they
were
already
close
to
the
walls
someone
reported
to
Xenophon
that
if
he
entered
he
would
be
seized,
and
either
do
what
he
was
told
or
be
handed
over
to
Pharnabazos.
On
hearing
this
he
let
the
others
go
on
and
told
them
he
wanted
to
make
a
sacrifice
about
something.
He
left
them
and
sacrificed,
asking
if
the
gods
would
allow
him
to
try
to
get
away
to
Seuthes
with
the
army;
for
he
saw
that
it
was
not
safe
to
cross
when
there
were
ships-of-war
to
prevent
him,
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
shut
up
in
the
Chersonese
and
let
the
army
be
destitute
in
a
place
where
it
was
necessary
to
obey
the
governor,
and
the
army
would
have
no
provisions.
Meanwhile
the
captains
and
officers
had
come
back
from
Aristarchos,
and
reported
that
he
bade
them
go
away
then
and
return
later
in
the
afternoon.
Then
it
seemed
clearer
that
there
was
a
plot.
Xenophon
found
the
omens
good
for
a
safe
journey
to
Seuthes;
and
therefore
he
took
Polycrates
the
Athenian,
and
one
trusty
man
from
each
of
the
captains
except
Neon,
and
travelled
by
night
to
the
army
of
Seuthes,
about
eight
miles.
As
they
drew
near
they
came
upon
deserted
watch
fires.
At
first
he
thought
Seuthes
had
gone
somewhere
else;
but
hearing
a
noise,
and
signallers
calling
to
each
other
among
his
people,
he
understood
what
had
happened;
Seuthes
had
lit
the
fires
in
front
of
his
pickets,
that
any
who
came
might
be
seen
clearly
in
the
light,
while
the
pickets
would
be
in
the
dark
behind,
and
no-one
could
see
how
many
they
were,
or
where,
Accordingly
he
sent
forward
the
interpreter
he
had,
with
instructions
to
tell
Seuthes
that
Xenophon
wished
to
meet
him,
They
asked,
“The
Athenian
from
the
army?”
He
said,
“That’s
the
man,”
and
they
leapt
up
and
off
they
went;
a
little
while
after
appeared
targeteers,
about
two
hundred,
who
took
charge
of
Xenophon
and
his
men
and
brought
them
to
Seuthes.
He
was
in
a
tower
strongly
guarded,
horses
all
round
it
bridled
and
bitted.
He
was
so
much
on
the
alert
that
he
gave
them
fodder
in
the
daytime,
when
they
might
have
been
grazing,
and
at
night
kept
them
in
bit
and
bridle
on
guard.
For
the
story
was
that
Teres,
his
ancestor
in
this
country
with
a
large
army,
had
been
attacked
by
these
people,
and
lost
many
men
and
all
his
baggage:
they
were
the
Thynians,
of
all
the
world
said
to
be
most
dangerous
by
night
in
time
of
war.
When
they
were
near
he
asked
Xenophon
to
enter
with
any
two
men
he
might
choose.
They
entered,
and
first
greeted
each
other
with
toasts,
and
horns
of
wine
in
Thracian
fashion;
beside
Seuthes
was
Medosades,
who
went
everywhere
as
his
minister.
Then
Xenophon
began
by
saying,
“You
sent
to
me
more
than
once,
Seuthes.
First,
you
sent
Medosades,
who
is
present
here,
to
Calchedon,
asking
me
to
do
my
best
to
help
in
bringing
over
the
army
from
Asia,
and
you
promised
to
make
it
worth
my
while
if
I
could,
so
Medosades
here
said.”
Then
he
asked
Medosades
if
that
was
true,
and
he
said
Yes.
“A
second
time
this
same
Medosades
came,
after
I
came
over
again
to
the
army
from
Parion,
promising
that
if
I
brought
the
army
to
you,
you
would
treat
me
as
your
friend,
and
in
particular
that
I
should
receive
from
you
the
places
on
the
sea
which
you
have
in
your
power.”
Then
he
asked
Medosades
again
whether
this
was
true,
and
he
said
Yes,
it
was.
“Then,”
said
Xenophon,
“repeat
to
him
what
I
answered,
first
at
Calchedon.”
“You
answered
that
the
army
would
cross
to
Byzantion
in
any
case,
and
for
that
he
need
not
pay
anything
to
you
or
anyone
else.
You
said
you
meant
to
sail
away
as
soon
as
you
yourself
had
crossed;
and
everything
went
as
you
said.”
“Well,
then,”
said
Xenophon,
“what
did
IJ
say
when
you
came
to
Selymbria?”
“You
said
it
couldn’t
be
done;
they
were
going
to
Perinthos
and
meant
to
cross
into
Asia.”
“Well,
then,”
said
Xenophon,
“at
this
moment
I
am
here
myself,
and
here
is
Phryniscos,
one
of
the
captains,
and
here
is
Polycrates,
one
of
the
other
officers,
and
outside
are
others,
one
from
each
of
the
captains
except
Neon
the
Laconian,
their
most
trusted
men.
So
if
you
wish
the
transaction
to
be
more
strongly
confirmed—go
outside,
Polycrates,
and
tell
them
to
leave
their
arms
there,
and
you
leave
your
sword
before
you
come
back.”
When
Seuthes
heard
this
he
said
that
he
would
never
distrust
an
Athenian;
he
knew
they
were
his
kinsmen,
and
believed
them
to
be
honest
friends.
Legend
connected
Teres
with
the
story
of
Tereus
and
Procne;
see
Aristophanes,
Birds,
368
etc.
After
this
the
men
came
in,
and
Xenophon
first
asked
Seuthes
how
he
wished
to
use
the
army.
He
answered:
“Maisades
was
my
father,
and
his
rule
was
over
the
Melanditans
and
Thynians
and
Tranipsans.
Afterwards
the
Odrysians
were
in
a
bad
way;
my
father
was
driven
out,
and
died
of
disease,
and
I
was
brought
up
an
orphan
in
the
house
of
Medocos,
the
present
king.
When
I
grew
up
to
be
a
young
man
I
could
not
endure
to
live
gazing
at
another’s
table,
so
I
sat
on
the
seat
beside
him,
as
a
suppliant;
I
prayed
him
to
give
me
as
many
men
as
he
could,
and
let
me
try
to
revenge
myself
on
those
who
threw
us
out,
and
not
live
gazing
at
another’s
table.
Then
he
gave
me
the
men,
and
the
horses
which
you
will
see
when
daylight
comes.
And
now
I
live
by
these,
robbing
my
own
ancestral
country.
But
if
you
join
me,
I
think
I
shall
easily
get
back
my
dominions,
please
God.
That
is
what
I
want
of
you.”
“Very
well,”
said
Xenophon.
“What
could
you
give
the
army
and
its
officers
and
captains?
Speak,
and
let
them
report.”
He
promised
for
each
man
a
cyzicene,
for
each
lieutenant
two,
and
for
each
captain
four,
and
as
much
land
as
they
wish,
yokes
of
oxen,
and
a
fort
on
the
sea.
“But,”
said
Xenophon,
“suppose
we
try
and
don’t
succeed,
and
there
is
a
scare
from
the
Lacedaimonians:
will
you
receive
them
into
your
country,
if
anyone
wishes
to
come?”
He
said,
“That
I
will,
and
make
them
brothers,
who
shall
sit
on
the
same
seat
with
me
and
share
all
we
are
able
to
get.
And
you,
Xenophon!
I
will
give
you
my
daughter,
and
if
you
have
a
daughter
I
will
buy
her
by
Thracian
law,
and
I
will
give
you
Bisanthe
Rodosto,
at
the
entrance
to
the
Holy
Mountain
Athos
to
live
in,
the
best
fort
I
have
on
the
sea!”
7.3
After
this
interview
they
exchanged
pledges
of
faith
and
departed.
Before
daylight
they
were
back
at
the
camp,
and
all
reported
to
those
who
had
sent
them.
When
day
came
Aristarchos
summoned
the
captains,
but
they
decided
to
ignore
the
summons
and
call
a
meeting.
All
came
except
Neon’s
men;
they
were
about
a
mile
off.
When
the
meeting
had
assembled
Xenophon
spoke
and
said:
“Men,
to
sail
where
we
wished
is
impossible;
Aristarchos
and
the
ships-of-war
bar
the
way.
Thus
it
is
not
safe
to
take
ship,
and
this
man
himself
orders
us
to
march
into
Chersonese
by
force
through
the
Holy
Mountain.
If
we
can
fight
our
way
there,
he
declares
that
he
will
not
sell
you
as
in
Byzantion,
or
deceive
you
again:
you
shall
receive
pay,
and
he
will
not
leave
you
in
want
of
provisions
any
longer
as
you
are
now.
That
is
what
he
says.
And
Seuthes
says
that
if
you
join
him,
he
will
treat
you
well.
“Now
consider
whether
you
prefer
to
sit
and
deliberate
here,
or
go
up
for
provisions
first.
My
own
opinion
is
that,
since
here
we
have
no
money
to
buy
with—and
without
money
they
forbid
us
to
take
any—we
should
go
up
among
the
villages
where
might
gives
right
to
take,
and
get
our
provisions
there;
then
listen
to
what
one
or
another
asks
of
you,
and
choose
what
you
think
best.
All
in
favour
of
this
hold
up
a
hand!”
All
held
up
hands.
“Then
go
and
pack
up,”
he
said,
“and,
when
the
signal
comes,
follow
your
leader.”
Then
Xenophon
led,
and
they
followed.
Neon
and
others
from
Aristarchos
tried
to
persuade
them
to
turn
back,
but
they
would
not
listen.
After
they
had
gone
on
three
or
four
miles,
they
were
met
by
Seuthes,
and
Xenophon
seeing
him
asked
him
to
ride
in
that
as
many
as
possible
should
hear
what
he
proposed.
As
soon
as
he
was
near
enough,
Xenophon
said:
“We
are
marching
to
find
food
for
this
army;
then
we
will
hear
both
you
and
the
Laconian’s
men,
and
choose
what
we
think
best.
So
if
you
will
lead
us
where
plenty
of
provisions
are
to
be
found,
we
shall
believe
ourselves
to
be
your
guests.”
Seuthes
answered,
“Oh,
I
know
heaps
of
villages
with
plenty
of
provisions,
just
far
enough
away
that
you
may
be
in
time
for
a
comfortable
breakfast.”
“Lead
on,
then,”
said
Xenophon.
They
reached
the
villages
later
in
the
afternoon,
and
the
soldiers
assembled,
and
Seuthes
spoke
as
follows:
“What
I
ask,
men,
is
to
take
the
field
with
me.
I
promise
to
pay
to
each
man
a
cyzicene,
and
to
officers
the
usual
thing;
besides
this,
I
will
reward
all
merit.
You
shall
have
food
and
drink
as
now
by
taking
it
from
the
country;
but
whatever
is
captured
I
claim
for
myself,
that
I
may
dispose
of
it
and
so
find
your
pay.
Whatever
runs
away
and
hides
we
are
able
to
chase
and
catch;
if
anyone
resists,
we
will
try
to
subdue
them
with
your
help.”
Xenophon
asked,
“How
far
from
the
sea
will
you
expect
the
army
to
follow
your”
He
answered,
“Nowhere
more
than
seven
days,
mostly
less.”
Then
it
was
open
for
all
to
speak;
and
many
did
speak,
very
much
the
same,
that
this
was
an
excellent
offer
of
Seuthes,
For
winter
had
come,
and
there
was
no
voyage
home
if
any
wished;
it
was
impossible
to
get
through
as
friends
if
they
had
to
pay
for
their
keep,
and
to
stay
and
be
fed
in
a
hostile
country
was
safer
with
Seuthes
than
alone,
in
all
this
plenty.
And
if
they
received
pay
too,
they
counted
that
a
godsend.
Xenophon
ended
all
by
saying,
“Is
there
anyone
against?
If
so,
let
him
speak.
If
not,
I
will
put
it
to
the
vote.”
No-one
opposed,
he
put
the
vote;
and
it
was
carried.
He
went
straight
to
Seuthes,
and
told
him
they
would
take
the
field
with
him.
After
this
the
men
encamped
in
their
companies;
and
Seuthes
invited
all
officers
to
dinner,
having
a
village
near.
At
the
doors,
as
they
were
going
in
to
dinner,
they
found
a
man
Heracleides
of
Maroneia.
A
Hellenic
city
in
Thrace
He
approached
each
guest
who
seemed
likely
to
have
some
present
for
Seuthes.
First
he
addressed
some
Parians,
some
who
were
there
to
arrange
friendship
with
Medocos,
King
of
the
Odrysians,
who
had
brought
gifts
for
him
and
his
queen;
and
he
said
that
Medocos
was
a
long
way
up
country,
twelve
days
from
the
sea,
and
Seuthes
would
be
master
on
the
coast
now
that
he
had
this
army.
“So
he
is
your
neighbour,
and
most
able
to
do
you
good
or
evil.
Then
if
you
are
sensible,
you
will
give
him
what
you
bring;
it
will
be
better
for
you
than
if
you
give
it
to
Medocos
who
lives
a
long
way
off.”
That
was
how
he
tried
to
get
round
those.
Next
he
came
to
Timasion
the
Dardanian,
since
he
had
heard
that
he
had
oriental
cups
and
rugs;
said
it
was
the
custom
when
invited
to
dinner
with
Seuthes
that
the
guests
made
presents
to
him.
“If
he
becomes
great
here,
he
is
able
to
send
you
home
or
to
make
you
rich
here.”
So
he
went
up
to
everyone
and
pleaded.
He
tried
Xenophon
also,
and
said,
“You
come
from
a
very
great
city,
and
you
have
a
very
great
name
with
Seuthes.
Perhaps
you
will
expect
to
take
forts
in
this
country,
as
others
of
your
people
have
done,
and
Jand
too.
It
is
worth
your
while,
then,
to
honour
Seuthes
magnificently.
I
give
this
advice
out
of
goodwill,
for
I
know
that
the
more
you
give
him,
the
more
you
will
get
from
him.”
Xenophon
was
perplexed,
for
he
had
brought
nothing
from
Parion
but
a
servant
and
journey-money.
When
the
company
was
assembled,
the
chiefs
of
the
Thracians
there,
and
the
captains
and
officers
of
the
Hellenes,
and
any
embassy
there
might
be
from
various
places,
they
were
seated
in
a
circle.
Then
three-legged
stools
were
brought
in
for
all;
these
were
piled
high
with
meat,
and
large
pasties
of
leavened
bread
skewered
to
the
meat.
Generally
the
tables
were
set
opposite
the
guests.
For
the
custom
was—and
Seuthes
began
doing
it
now;
he
picked
up
the
loaves
nearest
him,
and
broke
them
into
pieces,
and
threw
to
any
he
thought
fit,
and
so
with
the
meat,
leaving
only
a
taste
for
himself.
The
others
did
the
same
if
the
tables
were
near
them.
But
a
certain
Arcadian
named
Arystas,
a
rare
one
to
eat,
would
not
thank
you
for
thrownabouts;
he
picked
up
a
three-quartern
loaf
and
the
meat
and
put
it
across
his
knees
and
ate
away.
They
carried
round
horns
of
wine,
and
all
had
some;
but
when
the
butler
came
to
Arystas
with
his
horn,
and
Arystas
saw
that
Xenophon
had
done,
he
called
out,
“There’s
your
man;
give
it
to
him,
he’s
free,
but
I
haven’t
time
yet.”
Seuthes
heard
the
sounds,
and
asked
the
butler
what
he
said;
the
butler
knew
Greek,
and
told
him.
Then
there
was
laughter.
When
the
drinking
was
well
on,
a
Thracian
man
came
in
with
a
white
horse,
and,
taking
a
full
horn,
he
said,
“I
drink
your
health,
Seuthes,
and
I
present
you
with
this
horse.
When
you
are
on
his
back,
you
will
catch
anyone
you
like
to
pursue,
and
in
retreat
you
will
fear
no
foe.”
Another
brought
in
a
boy,
and
gave
him
with
another
“Here’s
health!”
and
a
third
with
robes
for
his
wife.
Timasion
drank
a
health,
and
offered
a
bow!
of
silver
and
a
rug
worth
forty
pounds.
An
Athenian,
Gnesippos,
rose
and
said,
“It
was
a
good
old
rule
that
if
you
have,
you
give
to
the
king
to
show
him
honour,
and
if
you
have
not,
the
king
gives
to
you,
and
then
I
too,”
says
he,
“may
have
a
gift
to
honour
him!”
Xenophon
did
not
know
what
on
earth
to
do,
for
as
a
guest
of
honour
he
was
on
the
seat
nearest
Seuthes.
Then
Heracleides
told
the
butler
to
hand
him
the
horn;
and
Xenophon,
who
had
had
a
few
drinks,
boldly
took
the
horn,
and
said,
“And
I,
Seuthes,
give
you
myself
and
these
my
comrades
to
be
your
true
friends,
and
not
a
man
of
them
unwilling—all
wishing
to
be
your
friends
even
more
than
I
do!
Here
they
are,
asking
for
nothing,
but
offering
themselves
to
work
for
you
and
to
face
danger
for
you
willingly,
With
their
help,
please
God,
you
shall
win
back
the
country
of
your
fathers,
and
win
more
to
boot,
a
great
dominion,
and
many
horses,
many
men
and
fair
women.
You
will
not
need
to
take
them
as
spoil,
but
these
men
themselves
will
bring
them
to
you
as
gifts.”
Seuthes
got
up
and
drank
with
him,
and
sprinkled
the
last
drops
over
him.
After
this,
men
came
in
sounding
the
horns
which
they
use
for
signals,
and
trumpeting
tunes
on
trumpets
made
of
raw
hide,
something
like
the
music
of
Egyptian
strings.
Seuthes
himself
stood
up
and
roared
a
war-cry,
and
jumped
aside
very
nimbly
as
if
he
were
dodging
a
shot.
Then
jesters
came
in.
When
the
sun
was
setting,
the
Hellenes
rose
and
said
it
was
time
to
set
the
watch
and
give
the
watchword.
They
asked
Seuthes
to
direct
that
none
of
the
Thracians
was
to
enter
their
camp
in
the
night;
they
said,
“Our
enemies
are
Thracians,
and
you
are
our
friends.”
After
they
had
gone,
Seuthes
rose
too,
looking
as
sober
as
you
like.
He
went
out,
and
called
the
captains
aside
to
say,
“Gentlemen,
our
enemies
do
not
yet
know
our
alliance;
then
if
we
attack
them
before
they
are
on
their
guard,
and
before
they
can
prepare
any
defence,
we
could
make
a
fine
sweep
of
captives
and
spoil.”
The
captains
agreed,
and
told
him
to
lead
on.
He
said,
“Get
ready
and
wait
for
me.
I
will
come
at
the
proper
time
and
pick
you
up
with
your
light
troops,
and
then
with
the
gods’
help
I
will
lead
you.”
Then
Xenophon
said,
“If
we
are
to
have
a
night
march,
consider
if
our
custom
is
better.
In
daylight,
that
part
of
the
army
leads
which
may
be
most
suitable
for
the
country,
heavy
troops
or
light
troops
or
cavalry;
but
at
night
our
custom
is
for
the
slowest
arm
to
lead—in
this
way
the
divisions
are
least
pulled
apart,
and
they
don’t
slip
away
from
each
other
without
being
seen.
If
sections
are
pulled
apart
they
often
fall
foul
of
each
other,
and
do
much
harm,
or
suffer
harm
ignorantly.”
Seuthes
answered,
“You
are
right,
and
I
will
follow
your
custom.
You
shall
have
guides
from
the
oldest
of
my
men,
who
know
the
country
best,
and
I
will
come
last
with
my
horses;
I
shall
be
at
the
head
soon
enough,
I
think,
if
necessary.”
They
gave
Our
Lady
of
Athens
as
watchword,
because
of
their
kinship.
Then
they
went
to
rest.
About
midnight
Seuthes
was
there
with
his
horsemen,
armed
in
their
corselets,
and
his
targeteers
with
their
weapons.
He
gave
the
guides,
the
men-at-arms
led,
the
targeteers
followed,
the
horse
kept
the
rear.
When
daylight
came,
Seuthes
rode
to
the
front
and
praised
the
Hellenic
custom.
“Often,”
he
said,
“while
marching
at
night,
I
and
the
horses
have
broken
off
from
the
foot;
now
here
the
day
shows
us
all
together
as
we
should
be!
Now
you
must
wait
here
and
rest
a
bit,
and
I
will
go
on
and
scout.”
Then
he
rode
away,
taking
a
path
through
the
mountains.
Coming
to
a
patch
of
snow,
he
looked
round
to
see
if
there
were
any
tracks
of
men
going
forwards
or
backwards;
but
the
snow
was
untrodden,
as
he
saw,
and
he
soon
came
back,
and
said,
“Men,
it
will
be
all
right,
if
God
will;
we
shall
give
the
fellows
a
surprise!
I
will
go
first
with
the
horse,
and
then
if
we
see
anyone
he
will
not
get
away
and
alarm
them.
You
follow
me;
if
we
get
too
far
ahead,
follow
the
horses’
tracks.
When
we
are
over
the
mountains,
we
shall
find
plenty
of
prosperous
villages.”
By
midday
he
was
on
the
heights,
and
with
a
glance
down
at
the
villages
he
rode
back
to
the
heavy
troops,
and
said,
“Now
I
am
going
to
send
these
down
at
a
run,
horsemen
to
the
plain,
targeteers
to
the
villages.
You
come
on
at
your
best
pace
to
support
us
if
they
resist.”
Xenophon
heard
this,
and
got
down
from
his
horse;
and
Seuthes
asked,
“Why
do
you
get
down
when
speed
is
what
we
want?”
Xenophon
answered,
“I
know
you
don’t
want
me
alone;
these
men
will
run
faster,
and
more
contented,
if
I
run
at
the
head
of
them.”
Then
Seuthes
was
off,
and
Timasion
went
with
him,
and
the
Hellenic
horsemen,
about
forty.
Xenophon
sent
the
word
to
each
section,
“All
men
of
thirty
and
under,
fall
out!”
Then
he
took
all
these
active
young
fellows
and
went
bowling
along
at
the
head
of
these,
leaving
the
rest
for
Cleanor.
Arrived
at
the
villages,
Seuthes
rode
up
with
some
twenty
horsemen,
and
said,
“It’s
just
as
you
said,
Xenophon,
we
have
the
fellows—but
there
are
my
cavalry
gone
off
unsupported,
chasing
all
over
the
place.
I’m
afraid
the
enemy
will
rally
somewhere
and
do
some
mischief!
Some
of
us
must
remain
in
the
villages,
for
they
are
full
of
people.”
“TIl
take
the
heights,
then,”
said
Xenophon,
“with
the
men
I
have
here;
tell
Cleanor
to
extend
the
line
along
by
the
villages.”
As
soon
as
this
was
done,
captives
were
collected,
about
a
thousand,
cattle
two
thousand,
sheep
and
so
forth
ten
thousand
besides.
Then
they
spent
the
night
there
in
the
open.
7.4
Next
day
Seuthes
burnt
the
villages
completely,
leaving
not
one
house,
to
make
the
others
afraid
what
would
happen
to
them
if
they
did
not
obey,
and
went
back
again.
He
sent
Heracleides
to
Perinthos,
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
spoil
and
find
pay
for
the
soldiers;
he
himself
and
the
Hellenes
encamped
on
the
Thynian
plain.
The
natives
left
it
and
took
refuge
in
the
highlands.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
snow
and
cold,
so
that
the
water
they
brought
for
supper
froze,
and
the
wine
in
the
jars;
and
many
of
the
Hellenes
were
frostbitten
in
nose
and
ears.
Then
it
became
clear
why
the
Thracians
wore
the
foxskin
caps
over
head
and
ears,
and
shirts
not
only
about
the
breast
but
over
the
thighs,
and
why
they
wear
long
wraps
on
horseback
covering
the
feet,
not
merely
cloaks.
Seuthes
set
free
some
of
the
captives,
and
sent
them
into
the
mountains
to
say
that
unless
they
would
come
down
and
live
in
their
villages
and
obey
him,
he
would
burn
their
villages
also,
and
their
corn,
and
they
should
be
starved
to
death.
After
this
they
came
down,
women
and
children
and
older
men;
the
younger
men
were
quartered
in
the
villages
under
the
mountains.
When
Seuthes
learnt
this
he
told
Xenophon
to
take
the
youngest
of
the
heavy
troops
and
follow
him.
They
got
up
in
the
night,
and
by
daylight
they
were
at
those
villages.
Most
of
the
natives
escaped,
for
the
mountains
were
near;
those
he
took
Seuthes
killed
without
mercy.
An
Olynthian
was
there,
Episthenes,
a
boylover;
he
saw
a
handsome
boy,
just
old
enough
to
bear
a
shield,
about
to
be
put
to
death,
and
running
to
Xenophon
he
begged
him
to
save
a
handsome
boy.
Xenophon
besought
Seuthes
not
to
kill
the
boy,
and
told
him
the
ways
of
Episthenes;
how
he
once
enrolled
a
company,
only
careful
they
should
be
handsome
boys,
and
then
with
these
proved
himself
a
good
man.
Seuthes
asked
him,
“Would
you
be
willing
even
to
die
for
this
boy,
Episthenes?”
The
man
stretched
out
his
neck
and
said,
“Strike!
If
the
boy
tells
you,
and
if
he
will
be
grateful.”
Seuthes
asked
the
boy
if
he
should
strike
the
man
instead
of
himself,
The
boy
said,
“No,
sir,
don’t
kill
either
of
us!”
Thereupon
Episthenes
threw
his
arms
round
the
boy
and
said,
“Now
then,
Seuthes,
fight
me
for
the
boy—I
won’t
let
him
go!”
Seuthes
laughed,
and
said,
“Oh,
all
right!”
But
he
decided
to
make
bivouac
there,
that
those
in
the
mountains
might
get
no
food
from
the
place.
He
went
farther
down
into
the
plain
himself
and
encamped
there;
and
Xenophon
with
his
picked
men
stayed
in
the
highest
village
under
the
mountains,
while
the
other
Hellenes
encamped
near,
among
the
people
they
call
the
Highland
Thracians.
Not
many
days
passed
after
this
before
the
Thracians
came
down
from
the
mountains,
and
treated
with
Seuthes
for
a
truce
and
hostages.
Xenophon
also
came
to
him,
and
said
they
were
in
bad
quarters
with
the
enemy
close
at
hand;
they
would
rather
be
quartered
outside
in
strong
places,
than
just
under
cover,
plain
destruction.
Seuthes
told
him
not
to
fear,
and
showed
hostages
there
from
them.
And
others
came
down
to
Xenophon
from
the
mountains,
and
begged
him
to
help
them
to
make
the
truce,
He
agreed,
and
told
them
to
fear
nothing;
he
promised
that
no
hurt
should
come
to
them
if
they
obeyed
Seuthes.
But
it
turned
out
that
they
had
come
only
to
spy.
This
was
what
happened
in
the
day;
but
on
the
following
night
the
Thynians
came
from
the
mountains
and
attacked
him.
They
were
led
to
each
house
by
the
master,
for
it
was
difficult
otherwise
to
find
the
houses
in
those
villages
when
it
was
dark,
as
the
houses
were
fenced
round
with
great
stakes
on
account
of
the
stock.
When
they
came
to
the
door
of
each
house
some
threw
in
spears,
others
battered
with
their
cudgels,
which
they
carried
to
knock
off
the
spearheads,
as
they
said;
others
applied
fire,
and
they
called
Xenophon
by
name
to
come
out
and
die,
or
else
they
would
burn
him
there.
Fire
was
showing
already
through
the
roof,
and
Xenophon’s
men
inside
had
their
corselets
on
and
shields
and
swords
and
helmets;
then
Silanos,
a
young
Macistian
of
about
eighteen,
sounded
the
trumpet—and
at
once
they
leapt
out
sword
in
hand,
and
the
men
from
the
other
places
too.
The
Thracians
threw
the
light
shields
round
to
their
backs,
and
ran,
as
their
custom
was.
As
they
climbed
over
the
palisade
some
of
them
were
caught
by
their
shields
on
the
stakes
and
hung
there;
some
missed
the
way
and
were
killed;
the
Hellenes
chased
many
of
them
out
of
the
village.
Some
of
the
Thynians
who
had
rallied
in
the
dark
cast
javelins
at
the
runners
as
they
passed
from
darkness
into
the
light
beside
a
burning
house;
they
wounded
two
captains,
Hieronymos
and
Theogenes
the
Locrian,
but
killed
no-one,
although
some
lost
clothes
and
baggage
burnt.
Seuthes
came
to
their
aid
with
seven
horsemen,
the
first
he
could
find,
and
brought
also
his
Thracian
trumpeter.
From
the
moment
he
heard
of
the
trouble,
and
all
the
time
he
was
coming,
the
horn
was
kept
sounding,
which
struck
terror
into
the
enemy.
When
he
arrived
he
clasped
their
hands,
crying,
“I
thought
I
should
find
many
dead.”
After
this
Xenophon
begged
him
to
give
him
the
hostages,
and
to
join
him
in
an
expedition
into
the
hills,
or
else
to
let
him
go
alone.
So
next
day
Seuthes
gave
him
the
hostages,
men
well
on
in
years,
and,
as
they
said,
the
most
powerful
of
the
highlanders;
and
he
came
himself
with
his
force.
The
force
was
already
thrice
as
large
as
before,
since
numbers
of
the
Odrysians,
hearing
what
he
was
about,
had
come
down
to
join
him.
When
the
Thynians
from
the
mountains
saw
so
many
men-at-arms,
so
many
targeteers,
so
many
horsemen,
they
came
down
and
besought
him
to
make
peace,
and
promised
to
obey
him
and
offered
sureties,
Seuthes
called
in
Xenophon
and
explained
what
they
said,
and
declared
he
would
not
make
truce
or
peace
if
Xenophon
wished
to
take
revenge
for
the
onslaught.
He
said:
“I
think
I
have
full
satisfaction,
if
these
are
to
be
slaves
instead
of
free
men.
However,
I
advise
you
in
future
to
take
as
hostages
those
who
can
do
the
most
mischief,
and
leave
the
old
men
at
home.”
Thus
all
in
that
part
of
the
country
submitted.
7.5
They
now
crossed
over
to
the
Thracians
above
Byzantion,
into
what
is
called
the
Delta;
this
was
no
longer
the
domain
of
Maisades,
but
of
Teres
the
Odrysian.
Heracleides
was
there
already,
with
the
price
of
the
spoil.
Seuthes
then
drove
out
three
pairs
of
mules
(there
were
only
three,
all
the
rest
were
oxen),
called
Xenophon
and
told
him
to
take
them,
and
to
distribute
the
others
among
the
officers.
Xenophon
said,
“I
can
wait
for
another
time;
give
these
to
those
captains
and
officers
who
have
served
with
me.”
So
these
pairs
of
mules
went
one
to
Timasion,
one
to
Cleanor,
one
to
Phryniscos;
the
pairs
of
oxen
were
distributed
to
the
underofficers,
Then
he
gave
the
pay,
but
he
could
find
pay
only
for
twenty
days,
although
the
whole
month
was
up.
Heracleides
declared
that
was
all
he
had
got
for
the
sale,
Xenophon
was
angry,
and
said
with
an
oath,
“I
don’t
think
you
look
after
the
interests
of
Seuthes
as
you
should;
if
you
had
you
would
have
brought
the
pay
in
full,
even
borrowing
something
if
you
couldn’t
help
it,
even
selling
your
own
clothes!”
Then
Heracleides
was
angry,
and
feared
he
might
lose
the
friendship
of
Seuthes;
and
he
did
all
he
could
from
that
day
to
set
Seuthes
against
Xenophon.
Indeed,
the
soldiers
blamed
Xenophon
because
they
had
not
their
pay;
Seuthes
was
angry
with
him
because
he
dunned
him
for
the
pay.
So
far
he
had
been
always
saying
that
he
would
give
him
Bisanthe
and
Ganos
and
Newcastle,
as
soon
as
he
got
to
the
sea;
but
from
that
time
he
never
mentioned
them.
For
Heracleides
kept
dinning
into
his
ears
that
it
was
not
safe
to
give
forts
to
a
man
who
had
ah
army.
Then
Xenophon
began
to
think
what
he
was
to
do
about
the
campaign
up
country.
And
Heracleides
brought
the
other
captains
before
Seuthes,
and
bade
them
say
that
they
could
lead
the
army
quite
as
well
as
Xenophon;
he
promised
them
their
pay
within
a
few
days,
full
pay
for
two
months,
and
urged
them
to
march.
Then
Timasion
said:
“I
would
not
go
without
Xenophon,
not
if
you
paid
me
for
five
months.”
Phryniscos
and
Cleanor
agreed.
Then
Seuthes
scolded
Heracleides
for
not
having
brought
Xenophon
too.
Presently
they
invited
him
by
himself.
He
understood
the
perfidy
of
Heracleides,
and
how
he
had
been
scheming
against
him
with
the
captains;
so
when
he
came
he
brought
the
other
captains
and
officers,
and
they
all
agreed.
So
they
set
out
together,
and
keeping
the
Euxine
on
the
right,
marched
through
the
country
of
Millet-eating
Thracians,
as
they
are
called,
as
far
as
Salmydessos.
There
many
of
the
ships
that
sail
into
the
Euxine
run
aground
and
are
wrecked,
for
there
are
many
shallows
running
out
into
the
sea.
The
Thracians
in
those
parts
put
up
boundary
marks,
and
plunder
all
that
are
cast
into
their
portions;
formerly,
they
say,
many
had
been
killed
fighting
with
each
other
over
the
plunder,
before
they
set
up
the
marks.
Here
was
a
great
find,
beds
and
boxes
and
written
books,
and
everything
else
which
mariners
carry
in
their
wooden
chests.
Having
reduced
all
this
district,
they
came
back.
By
this
time
Seuthes
had
an
army
of
his
own
larger
than
theirs;
for
many
more
had
come
down
from
the
Odrysians,
and
his
new
subjects
all
joined
with
him.
They
made
bivouac
on
the
plain
above
Selymbria,
three
or
four
miles
from
the
sea.
No
pay
yet
appeared;
and
the
soldiers
were
very
much
put
out
with
Xenophon,
because
he
was
no
longer
great
with
Seuthes,
but
if
ever
he
wanted
to
see
him
many
difficulties
were
put
in
the
way.
7.6
At
this
time,
when
nearly
two
months
had
passed,
a
mission
came
from
Thimbron,
Charminos
the
Laconian
and
Polyneicos.
They
said
that
the
Lacedaimonians
had
resolved
to
make
a
campaign
against
Tissaphernes,
and
Thimbron
had
sailed
for
the
war;
that
he
wanted
this
army,
and
offered
pay
one
daric
per
man
per
month,
two
for
a
lieutenant,
and
four
for
a
captain.
As
soon
as
these
men
arrived
Heracleides
heard
they
were
visiting
the
army,
and
said
to
Seuthes,
“Here’s
a
great
piece
of
luck!
The
Lacedaimonians
want
the
army
and
you
don’t;
then
give
them
the
army,
and
they
won’t
ask
for
any
more
pay—they
will
just
clear
out
of
the
country.”
Seuthes,
on
hearing
this,
told
him
to
bring
the
men
in.
They
said
they
were
visiting
the
army;
and
he
said
he
would
give
it
up,
and
wished
to
be
their
friend
and
ally,
and
invited
them
to
a
banquet,
which
was
magnificent.
But
he
did
not
invite
Xenophon
or
any
other
of
the
captains.
The
Lacedaimonians
asked,
“What
sort
of
a
man
is
Xenophon?”
“Not
a
bad
sort,”
he
said,
“but
too
fond
of
his
men.
So
much
the
worse
for
him!”
“What,”
said
they,
“does
he
harangue
the
men?”
Heracleides
said,
“I
should
think
he
does!”
“Well,
then,”
they
said,
“perhaps
he
will
object
to
our
carting
them
off?”
“Just
you
collect
them,”
said
Heracleides,
“and
promise
the
pay;
much
they
will
care
for
him!
Off
they
will
run
with
you.”
“Then
how
could
we
get
them
together?”
they
wanted
to
know.
“To-morrow,”
said
Heracleides,
“early
in
the
morning
we'll
take
you
to
them;
and
I
am
sure,”
says
he,
“as
soon
as
they
see
you,
they
will
run
together
glad
enough.”
Thus
ended
that
day.
Next
morning
the
Laconians
came
to
the
army,
led
by
Seuthes
and
Heracleides,
and
the
men
collected.
Then
two
Laconians
said,
“The
Lacedaimonians
have
resolved
to
make
war
on
Tissaphernes,
who
has
wronged
you;
then
if
you
will
go
with
us,
you
shall
punish
your
enemy,
and
every
man
shall
receive
a
daric
per
month,
every
lieutenant
two
darics,
and
every
captain
four.”
The
men
were
delighted
to
hear
it.
At
once
an
Arcadian
rose
to
accuse
Xenophon.
Seuthes
was
there
also,
wanting
to
hear
what
would
be
done,
and
stood
with
an
interpreter
within
hearing;
but
he
understood
himself
a
good
deal
of
Greek.
Then
the
Arcadian
said:
“We
should
have
been
with
you
long
ago,
Lacedaimonians,
if
Xenophon
had
not
persuaded
us
and
brought
us
here,
and
what
a
place!
Through
this
dreadful
winter
we
have
been
campaigning
night
and
day
without
rest,
and
he
enjoys
our
labours;
Seuthes
has
made
him
a
rich
man
privately,
and
he
keeps
our
pay
from
us.
If
I
could
only
see
this
man
punished
and
stoned
for
dragging
us
about,
I
should
call
it
pay
in
full,
and
I
wouldn’t
worry
about
my
labours.”
After
this
another
got
up
and
another,
just
the
same,
and
at
last
Xenophon
spoke:
“Then
there
is
nothing
a
man
must
not
expect
in
this
world,
as
it
seems,
when
I
stand
here
now
to
be
accused
by
you,
and
in
something
where
I
know
in
my
conscience
that
I
have
used
my
utmost
endeavours
on
your
behalf.
I
was
already
on
my
way
home,
when
I
was
turned
aside
by
hearing
of
you—not
because
I
heard
you
were
in
luck,
not
at
all;
no,
I
heard
you
were
at
your
wits’
end,
and
hoped
to
help
you
if
I
could.
When
I
came
to
you,
Seuthes,
who
is
here
present,
sent
messenger
after
messenger
to
me,
and
made
great
promises
to
me
if
I
would
persuade
you
to
join
him.
Yet
I
did
not
try
to
do
that,
as
you
know
yourselves;
I
led
you
to
the
place
where
I
thought
you
could
cross
most
quickly
to
Asia.
I
believed
that
to
be
best
for
you,
and
you
wished
it,
as
I
knew.
Then
Aristarchos
came
with
ships
of
war
and
stopt
that.
“Next
I
did
the
natural
thing,
I
suppose,
and
called
you
together
that
we
might
consider
what
we
must
do.
Aristarchos
ordered
you
to
go
into
the
Chersonese.
Seuthes
tried
to
persuade
you
to
join
his
expedition:
you
heard
both,
and
all
said
go
with
Seuthes,
all
voted
for
that.
What
wrong
did
I
do
you,
then,
when
I
led
you
where
you
all
decided
to
go?
However,
Seuthes
deceived
you
about
your
pay:
if
I
praise
him
for
that,
you
would
have
a
right
to
hate
me
and
accuse
me;
if
I
am
now
wholly
estranged
from
him,
having
been
formerly
his
especial
friend,
what
right
could
you
have
to
blame
me
for
this
estrangement
when
I
chose
you
instead
of
Seuthes?
“Well,
perhaps
you
might
say
that
it
is
possible
I
got
your
money
from
Seuthes,
and
I
am
just
pretending.
Then
one
thing
is
clear:
if
Seuthes
paid
me
anything,
he
did
not
expect
to
have
to
pay
it
again
to
you,
and
so
throw
away
what
he
gave
to
me.
Not
so,
I
think;
if
he
gave
it,
he
would
give
it
on
the
understanding
by
paying
me
less
he
might
avoid
paying
you
more.
Very
well,
if
you
believe
that
happened,
you
have
the
power
here
and
now
to
make
the
transaction
worth
less
for
both
of
us
by
demanding
and
getting
the
money
from
him.
It
is
clear
that
if
I
have
had
any
of
it
from
him,
he
will
ask
for
it
back,
and
quite
right
too,
if
I
do
not
carry
out
the
transaction
for
which
I
took
the
bribe.
“Far
from
it—I
have
nothing
of
yours.
I
swear
to
you
solemnly
by
gods
and
goddesses
all,
that
I
have
not
even
what
Seuthes
promised
me
personally.
He
is
present
himself,
and
hears
me,
and
knows
whether
I
am
forsworn.
What
will
surprise
you
more,
I
swear
that
I
did
not
receive
even
what
the
other
captains
did,
no
indeed,
not
even
as
much
as
some
of
the
under-officers.
Why
did
I
behave
so?
I
believed,
gentlemen,
that
the
better
I
helped
him
to
bear
the
poverty
he
had
then,
the
better
friend
he
would
be
when
he
should
become
powerful.
But
now
I
see
him
in
his
prosperity,
and
now
I
understand
his
mind,
“One
might
well
ask
whether
I
am
not
ashamed
to
be
deceived
like
a
fool.
Upon
my
word,
I
should
be
ashamed
indeed
if
an
enemy
had
deceived
me;
but
for
a
friend,
I
think
it
more
disgraceful
to
deceive
than
to
be
deceived.
If
we
can
speak
of
precautions
against
a
friend,
I
know
we
took
every
precaution
to
give
him
no
just
excuse
not
to
pay
what
he
promised;
for
we
have
done
him
no
wrong,
we
never
were
slack,
never
dawdled
over
what
he
asked
us
to
do,
“But,
you
might
say,
security
ought
to
have
been
taken,
that
he
might
not
have
been
able
to
deceive
if
he
wished.
Then
listen
to
me
while
I
tell
what
I
should
never
have
said
in
his
presence,
if
you
had
not
shown
yourselves
altogether
stupid
or
else
wholly
ungrateful
to
me.
Just
remember
what
a
state
you
were
in
when
I
brought
you
out
to
Seuthes.
You
went
to
Perinthos,
but
you
couldn’t
get
in—
Aristarchos
the
Lacedaimonian
shut
the
gates
in
your
faces.
You
were
outside
in
the
open
air,
it
was
midwinter,
you
had
a
market,
but
there
was
little
to
buy
and
little
to
buy
with;
you
were
forced
to
remain
in
Thrace—for
ships-of-war
were
there
to
prevent
a
crossing;
but
if
you
did
remain,
you
would
be
in
an
enemy
country;
there
were
large
forces
of
cavalry
against
you,
and
large
forces
of
light
troops,
and
what
had
we?
A
force
of
heavy-armed
men,
yes,
and
if
we
had
taken
it
in
a
body
to
the
villages
perhaps
we
could
have
got
some
corn,
nothing
much;
but
to
pursue
and
capture
prisoners
or
sheep—we
had
nothing
at
all
for
that:
I
found
no
regular
body
at
all
of
horse
or
targeteers
with
you.
In
such
a
necessity,
if
I
had
asked
no
pay
at
all
from
Seuthes
and
only
got
him
for
an
ally,
when
he
had
the
cavalry
and
light
troops
which
you
wanted,
would
you
have
thought
I
made
a
bad
bargain
for
you?
Only
by
sharing
in
those,
of
course,
you
found
any
amount
of
corn
in
the
villages,
because
the
Thracians
were
compelled
to
run
away
in
a
hurry,
and
you
took
more
cattle
and
captives.
Enemies
—we
never
saw
one
of
them
any
longer
as
soon
as
the
horse
was
added
to
us;
before
that,
the
enemy
followed
us
boldly
with
horse
and
light
infantry,
and
we
could
not
break
into
small
bodies
and
scatter
anywhere
to
get
more
abundant
provisions.
And
if
the
man
who
provided
this
safety
for
you
did
not
really
give
you
very
large
pay
for
this
safety,
that
is
really
dreadful
treatment!
And
that’s
why
you
think
I
must
never
leave
the
place
alive!
“And
how
are
you
off
now?
You
are
leaving
this
place;
you
have
spent
the
winter
in
the
midst
of
abundance,
and
whatever
you
got
from
Seuthes
is
so
much
to
the
good,
for
what
you
spent
the
enemy
paid.
Yes,
and
while
this
was
your
lot,
you
saw
none
of
your
comrades
killed
and
you
lost
none
alive.
Besides,
any
fine
feat
you
may
have
done
against
the
barbarians
in
Asia,
you
have
that
safe
and
sound,
haven’t
you?
And
now
you
have
won
a
new
glory
by
fighting
the
Thracians
in
Europe
too
and
conquering
them.
I
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
thank
God
for
the
very
things
you
complain
of,
since
they
are
blessings.
“So
much
for
you;
now
be
so
kind
as
to
consider
my
side
of
the
question.
When
I
set
out
for
home
that
time
I
had
your
good
wishes
and
best
thanks,
and
through
you
I
had
a
high
reputation
among
all
parts
of
our
nation.
I
was
trusted
by
the
Lacedaimonians,
or
they
would
not
have
sent
me
back
to
you.
I
go
now,
reprobated
by
you
before
the
Lacedaimonians,
and
disliked
by
Seuthes
on
your
account,
whom
I
hoped
to
serve
along
with
you
and
to
find
in
him
an
honourable
refuge
for
myself
and
my
children,
if
I
should
have
any.
And
you,
on
whose
behalf
I
have
made
many
enemies
and
those
more
powerful
men
than
I
am,
you
for
whom
I
have
never
ceased
working
and
still
work
now
to
do
you
what
good
I
can,
that
is
your
feeling
for
me.
Well,
you
have
me.
I
did
not
avoid
you,
I
did
not
run
from
you
and
let
you
catch
me,
If
you
do
to
me
what
you
say,
you
will
have
slain
a
man
who
has
spent
many
a
sleepless
night
for
you,
who
has
shared
many
toils
and
dangers
with
you,
in
my
turn
and
out
of
turn,
one
who
when
the
gods
were
gracious
has
set
up
very
many
trophies
of
the
barbarians
by
your
side,
and
strained
against
you
with
all
my
strength
to
save
you
from
becoming
enemies
to
any
of
your
countrymen,
Indeed
even
now
it
is
possible
for
you
without
reproach
to
travel
where
you
please
both
by
land
and
sea.
But
you,
at
the
time
when
you
have
everything
open
to
you,
when
you
are
sailing
to
the
very
place
you
have
long
desired,
when
great
potentates
want
you
and
you
can
see
your
pay,
when
your
leaders
are
the
Lacedaimonians,
by
common
consent
the
dominant
power—this
is
exactly
the
time
you
think
to
be
just
right
for
putting
me
to
death.
But
not
in
the
time
of
our
troubles:
you
have
the
best
of
memories,
you
never
forget.
No,
then
you
called
me
father,
and
vowed
always
to
speak
of
me
as
your
benefactor.
But
these
men
who
have
come
for
you
now
are
not
hard-hearted
themselves.
As
I
take
it,
they
will
not
think
the
better
of
you
when
you
behave
so
to
me.”
He
spoke,
and
ceased.
Then
Charminos
the
Lacedaimonian
rose
and
spoke.
He
said:
“No,
be
the
twa
gads!
I
for
one
think
you
have
no
right
to
complain
of
this
man.
I’m
a
witness
myself
on
his
side.
What
Seuthes
said
when
I
and
Polynicos
asked
about
Xenophon,
what
sort
of
a
man
he
was,
what
he
said
was
he
had
only
one
fault
to
find;
he
said
he
was
too
fond
of
the
soldiers,
that’s
the
reason
why
he
didn’t
get
on
with
us
Lacedaimonians
or
with
himself.”
On
this
an
Arcadian
got
up,
Eurylochos
of
Lusia,
and
said
to
the
two
envoys,
“My
opinion
is,
that
you
begin
being
our
captains
here,
and
first
get
us
the
pay
from
Seuthes
whether
he
will
or
no,
but
don’t
take
us
away
before.”
Polycrates
the
Athenian
said
(prompted
by
Xenophon),
“Why,
man,”
says
he,
“I
see
Heracleides
here
too!
That
man
was
entrusted
with
the
property
which
we
won
by
hard
work,
and
he
sold
it,
and
did
not
give
the
proceeds
either
to
Seuthes
or
to
us.
He
stole
it
and
keeps
it
himself!
Let’s
get
hold
of
him,
if
we
have
any
sense;
for
this
fellow,”
says
he,
“is
not
a
Thracian,
he’s
a
Hellene
and
he
cheats
his
own
countrymen!”
When
Heracleides
heard
this,
he
was
dismayed;
he
found
Seuthes,
and
said,
“Let’s
get
out
of
the
claws
of
these
men,
if
we
are
wise.”
They
jumped
on
their
horses
and
galloped
away
to
their
own
camp.
Then
Seuthes
sent
Abrozelmes,
his
own
interpreter,
to
Xenophon,
and
asked
him
to
stay
behind
with
a
thousand
men-at-arms,
and
promised
to
give
him
the
forts
by
the
sea
and
others
besides.
Then
he
told
him
as
a
secret,
which
he
had
heard
from
Polynicos,
that
if
he
came
into
the
hands
of
the
Lacedaimonians
Thibron
certainly
meant
to
put
him
to
death.
Many
others
sent
similar
messages
to
Xenophon,
and
they
warned
him
he
was
calumniated
and
he
must
look
out.
On
hearing
all
this
he
took
two
victims
and
sacrificed
to
Zeus
the
King,
asking
whether
it
was
better
to
stay
with
Seuthes
on
the
terms
he
offered,
or
to
leave
along
with
the
army.
The
answer
was
to
leave.
7.7
After
that
Seuthes
went
farther
away
and
encamped;
the
Hellenes
took
up
quarters
in
the
villages
where
they
could
collect
as
much
food
as
possible
before
they
went
down
to
the
sea.
These
villages
had
been
given
by
Seuthes
to
Menosades,
and
Menosades
was
indignant
when
he
saw
his
property
being
used
up
there.
So,
taking
with
him
Odryses,
a
very
powerful
chief
of
those
who
had
come
down
from
inland,
and
about
thirty
horsemen,
he
came
to
the
Hellenic
camp
and
called
Xenophon
outside.
Xenophon
came
to
meet
him
with
some
of
his
officers
and
friends,
and
Menosades
said,
“I
protest
against
this
pillaging
of
our
villages.
I
speak
for
Seuthes,
and
this
man
has
come
from
Medocos
who
is
king
inland,
and
we
demand
that
you
leave
the
country;
otherwise
we
will
not
put
up
with
it,
but
we
will
resist
you
as
enemies
if
you
ravage
our
country.”
Xenophon
answered.
“You
are
the
last
man
who
ought
to
speak
so,
and
it
is
not
easy
to
answer
you:
but
for
the
sake
of
this
young
man
I
will
tell
him
about
us
both,
and
he
may
compare
us.
Before
we
became
your
friends,”
he
said,
“we
marched
where
we
would
through
this
country,
plundering
and
burning
at
will;
and
when
you
came
to
us
on
embassy,
you
lodged
beside
us
fearing
no
enemy.
Your
people
hardly
came
into
the
country
at
all,
or
if
you
did,
you
lodged
as
in
an
enemy
country,
with
your
horses
bitted
and
bridled.,
Then
you
became
our
friends,
and
through
us
you
hold
the
land
by
God’s
help;
and
now
see
how
you
drive
us
from
this
land,
which
we
gained
by
force
of
arms
and
handed
over
to
you!
For
as
you
know,
the
enemy
were
not
able
to
drive
us
out.
You
gave
us
no
gifts
and
no
help;
it
is
no
return
for
service
which
you
claim
now
you
send
us
away;
far
from
it—we
are
on
the
way
out
already,
and
so
far
as
possible
you
will
not
let
us
even
camp
in
the
country.
When
you
make
this
demand
you
have
no
shame
before
heaven,
or
before
this
man;
although
he
sees
you
now
rich,
whereas
you
lived
on
pillage
before
you
became
our
friend,
as
you
said
yourself.
And
then
what’s
the
use
of
addressing
me?”
says
he;
“I
am
no
longer
in
command,
but
the
Lacedaimonians,
to
whom
you
have
passed
over
that
army
to
take
away—without
consulting
me,
if
you
please!
I
came
into
their
bad
graces
by
bringing
the
army
to
you,
and
you
would
not
give
me
the
chance
of
doing
them
a
good
turn
by
passing
them
on!”
When
Odryses
heard
this
he
said,
“I’m
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
with
shame,
Medosades,
when
I
hear
such
things!
If
I
had
known
before,
I
would
never
have
come
with
you;
and
now
I
depart.
King
Medocos
would
not
be
pleased
either,
if
I
should
drive
out
a
benefactor.”
With
these
words
he
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
off
with
the
other
horsemen,
all
but
four
or
five.
Medosades
was
still
angry
at
the
plundering,
and
told
Xenophon
to
summon
the
two
Laconians.
He
approached
them
in
company
with
the
best
men
he
had,
and
told
them
that
Medosades
summoned
them,
and
what
his
demand
was
that
they
should
leave
the
country.
“I
believe
then,”
he
said,
“that
you
will
get
the
money
due,
if
you
say
they
have
asked
you
to
demand
their
pay
from
Seuthes,
whether
he
likes
it
or
not,
and
that
they
will
follow
you
gladly
if
they
get
that;
that
you
have
promised
the
soldiers
to
go
at
once
when
they
have
their
rights.”
The
Laconians
agreed;
they
would
say
this
and
more
as
forcibly
as
they
could,
and
they
set
out
at
once,
taking
with
them
the
most
suitable
persons.
When
they
arrived
Charminos
said:
“Have
you
anything
to
say
to
us,
Medosades?
If
not,
we
have
something
to
say
to
you.”
Medosades
answered
very
submissively,
“I
have
to
say
this,
and
Seuthes
the
same:
we
expect
not
to
be
injured
by
you
now
that
we
have
become
friends.
For
if
you
injure
these
people,
you
injure
us;
they
are
our
people.”
Then
the
Laconians
answered,
“Well,
we
are
ready
to
go
as
soon
as
the
men
receive
the
pay
which
they
demand
from
you.
If
not,
we
are
coming
to
defend
them
now,
and
to
punish
certain
persons
who
have
broken
their
oaths
and
wronged
them.
If
you
are
really
such,
we
shall
begin
to
gain
our
rights
from
you.”
And
Xenophon
said,
“Would
you
be
content,
Medosades,
to
leave
it
to
these
people
in
whose
country
we
are,
your
friends
as
you
call
them?
Let
them
decide
by
vote
whether
you
should
leave
the
country
or
we?”
He
said
No
to
that;
but
he
said
the
best
thing
would
be
for
the
two
Laconians
to
approach
Seuthes
about
the
pay,
and
he
thought
Seuthes
would
agree.
The
next
thing
was
to
send
Xenophon
with
him,
and
he
promised
to
demand
it.
He
only
asked
them
not
to
burn
the
villages.
Then
they
sent
Xenophon
with
the
men
who
seemed
best,
and
he
said
to
Seuthes:
“I
come
to
claim
nothing,
Seuthes;
but
to
show
that
you
were
not
right
to
be
angry
with
me,
because
I
claimed
so
urgently
from
you
what
you
had
promised
for
the
soldiers,
In
fact,
I
thought
it
no
less
useful
for
yourself
than
for
them,
First,
I
believed
that
after
heaven
it
was
they
had
made
you
famous;
they
made
you
king
of
a
great
country
and
a
great
population,
so
that
nothing
you
do
can
be
hidden,
whether
good
or
bad.
For
such
a
man
it
seemed
a
great
thing
not
to
be
thought
so
ungrateful
as
to
dismiss
his
benefactors;
and
a
great
thing
to
have
a
good
name
with
six
thousand
men;
but
greatest
of
all
not
to
make
yourself
distrusted
when
you
make
a
promise.
Indeed,
I
see
that
when
men
are
distrusted,
their
words
are
blown
about
empty
and
ineffective
and
despised;
but
whenever
men
are
known
to
keep
their
word,
if
they
want
anything
their
words
have
no
less
power
than
the
force
of
others:
and
if
they
desire
to
make
people
reasonable,
I
perceive
that
their
threats
bring
them
to
reason
no
less
than
summary
punishment
from
others,
And
if
such
men
make
a
promise,
they
achieve
no
less
than
others
do
by
a
gift
on
the
spot.
Just
remember
yourself
what
you
paid
in
advance
when
you
took
us
as
allies.
Nothing!—you
know
it.
But
we
believed
what
you
said
would
be
made
true,
when
you
encouraged
all
these
men
to
join
your
army,
and
to
win
you
a
domain
worth
no
less
than
thirty
talents,
the
sum
which
these
men
claim,
many
times
more
indeed.
Then
the
belief
and
trust,
which
won
your
empire,
is
being
sold
only
for
the
money
we
claim,
“Remember
again,
how
great
a
prize
you
thought
the
conquest
which
you
have
made.
I
am
well
assured
that
you
would
rather
have
achieved
what
you
have
achieved
than
to
receive
many
times
as
much
as
our
claim.
I
believe
myself
that
it
would
be
a
heavier
blow,
and
more
discreditable,
not
to
keep
now
what
you
have
than
not
to
get
it
then;
just
as
it
is
harder
to
become
poor
after
being
rich
than
never
to
have
been
rich
at
all,
more
painful
to
become
nobody
after
being
king
than
never
to
have
been
king
at
all.
“You
know
also
that
those
who
have
become
your
subjects
were
not
persuaded
by
friendship
to
be
ruled
by
you,
but
yielded
to
necessity,
and
they
would
try
to
make
themselves
free
again
unless
fear
restrained
them.
Then
what
do
you
think
would
make
them
fear
you
more
and
behave
reasonably?
If
they
should
see
the
soldiers
so
disposed
to
you
that
they
would
stand
by
if
you
told
them,
and
come
back
at
once
if
you
needed
them,
and
if
others
heard
from
them
such
good
stories
about
you
that
they
would
join
you
whenever
you
wished?
Or
if
they
should
suspect
that
noone
else
would
ever
come
to
you
because
these
doings
made
them
distrust
your
word,
and
even
your
own
men
felt
much
inclined
to
this
same
feeling?
Really
and
truly,
these
people
yielded
to
you
from
no
lack
of
numbers,
but
only
from
lack
of
leaders.
Then
there’s
a
risk
now
that
they
may
find
leaders
in
some
of
those
who
think
you
have
wronged
them,
or
even
in
the
Lacedaimonians
who
are
stronger
still:
suppose
the
soldiers
promise
more
willing
service
to
them
if
they
exact
what
is
due
from
you,
and
if
the
Lacedaimonians
agree
because
they
want
the
army!
Besides,
it
is
plain
enough
that
the
Thracians
who
are
now
under
your
rule
would
be
readier
to
march
against
you
than
with
you;
for
under
your
rule
slavery
is
their
lot;
if
you
were
conquered
it
would
be
freedom.
“Again,
if
you
think
you
must
care
for
the
country
now
as
being
your
own,
how
do
you
think
it
more
likely
to
be
uninjured?
Suppose
these
men
receive
what
they
claim;
they
would
depart
and
leave
peace
behind
them.
But
sup-
pose
they
remain
in
the
country
as
enemies,
and
you
should
try
to
bring
in
as
many
again
and
more
to
fight
on
your
side,
all
wanting
provisions!
And
which
would
cost
you
Most
money—if
you
pay
what
is
due
to
these,
or
if
you
have
to
pay
others,
a
force
strong
enough
to
conquer
them,
and
leave
the
debt
still
due?
Heracleides,
indeed,
as
he
used
to
explain
to
me,
found
the
sum
enormous.
Well,
I
declare
it
is
much
less
now
for
you
to
get
and
to
give
than
it
was
then
to
pay
the
tenth
part
before
we
came.
For
no
fixt
limit
divides
much
and
little,
but
only
how
much
one
can
give
and
the
other
can
take.
And
now
your
yearly
income
will
be
more
than
your
whole
possessions
then.
“All
I
have
said,
Seuthes,
has
been
forethought
for
a
friend;
I
wished
you
to
be
thought
worthy
of
the
goods
which
the
gods
have
given
you;
and
also
that
my
name
should
not
be
ruined
in
the
army.
For
I
assure
you
that
I
could
do
nothing
in
the
army
now,
whether
I
wished
to
injure
an
enemy
or
to
help
you
again.
That
is
how
they
are
disposed
towards
me.
But
I
protest
before
the
gods,
who
know,
and
before
you,
that
I
have
never
received
anything
from
you
on
account
of
the
soldiers,
and
I
have
never
asked
you
for
what
is
theirs,
and
indeed
never
asked
you
to
give
me
what
you
promised:
if
you
had
offered
it,
on
my
oath
I
never
would
have
taken
it,
unless
the
soldiers
were
to
receive
their
own
also.
It
would
have
been
a
disgrace
to
make
sure
of
mine,
and
to
look
on
while
they
were
wronged,
especially
as
they
held
me
in
honour.
Of
course
Heracleides
thinks
everything
is
rubbish
compared
with
money,
wholly
and
absolutely;
but
my
opinion
is,
Seuthes,
that
a
man
can
have
no
finer
or
more
glorious
possession,
especially
a
ruler,
than
virtue
and
justice
and
generosity.
For
who
has
these
is
rich:
friends
are
his
wealth,
those
many
he
has
and
the
many
who
wish
to
be;
while
he
prospers,
many
are
glad
with
him,
and
if
he
comes
to
grief,
he
lacks
not
those
who
will
help.
“However,
if
you
have
not
found
out
from
my
actions
that
I
was
heart
and
soul
your
friend,
and
if
you
cannot
learn
this
from
these
words
of
mine,
at
least
take
notice
of
the
words
of
all
the
soldiers:
you
were
there
yourself,
and
you
heard
what
they
said,
wishing
to
find
fault
with
me.
They
accused
me
to
the
Lacedaimonians
that
I
rated
you
higher
than
the
Lacedaimonians,
and
their
private
charge
was
that
I
cared
more
for
your
interests
than
theirs;
they
also
said
I
had
received
gifts
from
you.
What
do
you
think:
did
they
see
any
ill
will
in
me
towards
you
when
they
accuse
me
of
receiving
gifts
from
you?
Had
they
not
noticed
my
great
readiness
to
serve
you?
I
really
think
all
the
world
believe
that
one
ought
to
show
goodwill
to
one
who
presents
him
with
gifts.
And
what
of
you?
Before
I
had
served
you
in
any
way
you
received
me
pleasantly
with
eyes
and
voice,
you
entertained
me,
and
made
promises
for
the
future—
which
have
not
been
fulfilled;
and
when
you
had
done
what
you
wished,
and
now
that
you
have
become
very
great,
and
I
did
my
best,
now
the
soldiers
dishonour
me,
and
you
can
endure
to
look
on!
No,
I
believe
you
will
decide
to
pay
this
money;
time
will
be
your
teacher,
and
you
will
never
allow
yourself
to
see
your
benefactors
accusing
you.
Therefore
I
beg
you,
when
you
do
pay,
that
you
will
take
care
to
leave
me
as
you
found
me
with
the
soldiers.”
After
hearing
this
Seuthes
cursed
the
man
who
was
the
cause
why
this
pay
had
not
been
given
long
ago;
all
suspected
this
to
be
Heracleides.
“I
myself,”
says
he,
“never
had
a
notion
to
cheat
you,
and
pay
I
will!”
Then
Xenophon
said
again,
“Since
you
mean
to
pay,
now
I
beg
you
to
pay
through
me!
Don’t
allow
me
to
stand
differently
in
the
army
now
from
the
time
when
we
came
to
you.”
He
said,
“No!
you
shall
not
be
less
in
honour
with
the
army
for
my
sake;
and
if
you
will
stay
with
me,
bringing
only
a
thousand
menat-arms,
I
will
give
you
those
forts
and
all
else
that
I
promised!”
Xenophon
said,
“To
do
that
is
quite
impossible;
just
let
us
go.”
“Why,
look,”
said
Seuthes,
“you
will
be
safer
here
with
me.”
Xenophon
said
again,
“Many
thanks
for
your
goodwill,
but
for
me,
to
stay
is
impossible.
Yet
when
I
shall
be
in
better
honour,
believe
that
this
will
be
a
blessing
for
you
also.”
Then
Seuthes
said,
“Money
I
have
only
a
little
here,
and
that
I
give
you,
a
talent;
but
oxen
six
hundred,
and
sheep
about
four
thousand,
and
captives
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
so,
Take
these,
and
take
those
who
cheated
you
as
hostages,
and
then
you
may
go.”
Xenophon
laughed,
and
said,
“Well,
if
this
does
not
come
up
to
the
pay,
whose
talent
shall
I
say
this
is?
There’s
danger
for
me,
and
I
had
better
look
out
for
stones;
you
heard
the
threats.”
For
the
time
he
stayed
there.
Next
day
Seuthes
gave
over
what
he
had
promised,
and
sent
drovers
with
them.
The
soldiers
had
been
saying
that
Xenophon
intended
to
make
a
home
with
Seuthes
and
to
get
what
he
had
been
promised;
but
as
soon
as
they
saw
him,
they
ran
up
to
him
with
joy.
Xenophon
saw
Charminos
and
Polynicos,
and
said
to
them,
“Because
of
you,
all
this
has
been
kept
safe
for
the
army,
and
here
I
give
it
to
you;
Pray
arrange
to
distribute
it
to
the
men.”
So
they
took
it
over,
and
appointed
spoil-sellers
and
sold
it,
and
the
men
were
very
much
discontented.
Xenophon
took
no
part;
he
was
clearly
preparing
for
his
homeward
journey,
for
this
was
before
the
sentence
of
his
banishment
had
been
given
in
Athens.
But
the
authorities
in
the
army
came
and
begged
him
not
to
leave
until
he
should
lead
them
to
Thibron
and
hand
over
the
army
to
him.
7.8
After
that
they
sailed
across
to
Lampsacos,
and
there
Xenophon
was
met
by
Eucleides,
a
Phleiasian
seer,
the
son
of
Cleagoras,
who
painted
the
frescoes
in
the
Lyceion.
This
man
congratulated
Xenophon
on
being
safe
and
sound,
and
asked
how
much
gold
he
had.
Xenophon
said
on
his
oath
that
there
would
not
be
enough
to
pay
his
way
home,
unless
he
could
sell
his
horse
and
what
he
had
about
him.
The
man
would
not
believe.
The
Lampsacenes
sent
him
gifts
of
friendship,
and
while
he
was
sacrificing
to
Apollo,
he
asked
Eucleides
to
be
there;
then
Eucleides
at
the
sacrifice
said
he
believed
now
that
Xenophon
had
no
money.
“But
I’m
sure,”
says
he,
“that
even
if
you
are
going
to
get
some
an
obstacle
comes
in
the
way;
if
no
other,
you
are
your
own
obstacle!”
Xenophon
agreed.
The
man
said,
“Yes,
the
obstacle
is
Zeus
Merciful;”
and
he
asked,
“Have
you
sacrificed
already,
as
I
used
to
do
at
home
for
you,
with
whole
burnt-offering?”
Xenophon
replied
that
he
had
never
sacrificed
to
that
god
since
his
travels
began.
So
the
man
advised
him
to
do
as
he
used
to
do;
said
things
would
be
better
that
way.
Next
day
Xenophon
went
to
Ophrynion
and
sacrificed
a
whole
burnt-offering
of
pigs
in
the
family
fashion,
and
the
omens
were
good.
On
this
day
arrived
Bion
and
Nausicleides
with
pay
for
the
army;
they
were
entertained
by
Xenophon
and
they
brought
back
his
horse,
which
he
had
sold
in
Lampsacos
for
fifty
darics;
they
suspected
he
had
sold
it
for
want
of
money,
because
they
had
heard
how
he
loved
that
horse,
so
they
gave
it
back
and
would
not
let
him
return
the
price.
After
that
they
marched
through
the
Troad,
and
crossing
Ida,
they
reached
Antandros,
then
sailed
by
sea
to
the
plain
of
Thebe.
From
that
place
they
made
their
way
through
Adramyttion
and
Certonos
to
the
plain
of
the
Caicos,
and
so
reached
Pergamos
in
Mysia.
Then
Xenophon
was
entertained
by
Hellas,
the
wife
of
Gongylos
the
Eretrian.
She
informed
him
that
there
was
a
Persian
Asidates
in
that
plain;
she
said
he
could
capture
him
with
wife
and
children
and
cattle,
numbers
of
cattle,
if
he
attacked
at
night
with
three
hundred
men.
She
sent
to
show
them
the
way
her
own
cousin,
and
Daphnagoras,
one
whom
she
valued
very
highly.
So
Xenophon,
keeping
these
two
with
him,
sacrificed.
Basias
the
Elean
seer
was
present,
and
said
the
omens
were
most
favourable,
and
the
man
could
be
taken.
After
supper,
then,
he
set
out,
taking
with
him
the
officers
who
had
been
most
friendly
and
faithful
to
him
all
through,
in
hopes
to
do
them
a
good
turn.
Others
came
thrusting
themselves
in
to
join,
but
the
officers
refused,
“We
don’t
want
them
to
have
a
share,”
they
said,
as
if
the
spoil
was
in
their
hands.
They
arrived
about
midnight,
but
they
neglected
captives
and
cattle
around
the
tower,
and
most
of
them
escaped,
for
they
wanted
to
capture
the
man
himself
and
his
belongings.
They
attacked
the
tower,
but
failed
to
storm
it,
for
it
was
very
tall
and
large,
had
bulwarks
and
strong
men
to
defend
it.
So
they
began
to
dig
through
the
wall.
It
was
eight
clay
bricks
in
thickness,
but
by
daybreak
the
light
showed
through;
at
the
first
glimpse
of
light
someone
struck
through
with
an
iron
rod
large
enough
to
spit
a
whole
ox,
and
ran
through
the
thigh
of
the
nearest
man.
After
that
they
shot
arrows
through
the
hole,
so
that
it
was
not
safe
to
come
anywhere
near
the
place.
Then
with
shouting
and
beacon-fires
they
brought
help,
Itamenes
and
his
force,
and
from
Comania
Assyrian
men-at-arms
and
Hyrcanian
horsemen,
about
eighty,
who
were
also
in
the
king’s
pay,
and
others,
light-armed
troops,
about
eight
hundred,
others
from
Parthenion,
others
from
Apollonia
and
from
the
neighbouring
villages,
and
horsemen
also.
Then
it
was
high
time
to
look
for
a
way
of
retreat.
They
took
all
the
cattle
and
sheep
and
captives
and
made
a
square
with
these
in
the
middle;
they
were
not
anxious
about
the
booty
so
much
as
fearful
that
the
retreat
might
become
a
scampering
if
they
left
the
booty
behind,
and
if
the
enemy
should
be
bold
and
the
soldiers
discouraged—but
now
they
retreated
ready
to
fight
for
their
winnings.
When
Gongylos
saw
how
few
the
Hellenes
were,
and
how
many
the
enemy,
he
sallied
out
himself
against
his
mother’s
wish
with
his
own
force,
eager
to
take
a
part;
other
supports
were
Procles
from
Halisarna,
and
Teuthranias,
who
was
descended
from
Damaratos.
Xenophon’s
party
were
very
hard
pressed
by
this
time
with
arrows
and
slingstones,
and
marched
in
a
ring,
to
keep
their
shields
in
front
of
the
arrows;
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
cross
the
River
Carcasos,
and
almost
half
of
them
were
wounded.
There
Agasias,
the
Stymphalian
lieutenant,
was
wounded;
he
had
been
fighting
the
whole
time.
They
came
in
safe
at
last
with
about
two
hundred
captives,
and
sheep
enough
for
sacrifices,
Next
day
Xenophon
sacrificed,
and
led
out
the
whole
army
by
night.
He
intended
to
take
the
most
roundabout
way
through
Lydia,
to
put
the
people
off
their
guard;
he
hoped
they
might
not
be
alarmed
by
thinking
he
was
near.
Asidates
heard
that
Xenophon
had
sacrificed
for
another
attack
on
himself,
and
was
out
with
all
the
army,-and
he
quartered
himself
in
some
villages
under
the
town
of
Parthenion,
There
Xenophon
and
his
force
came
upon
him,
and
captured
him
and
his
wife
and
children,
and
the
horses
and
all
he
had;
so
the
first
omens
came
true.
Then
they
returned
to
Pergamos.
There
Xenophon
gave
hearty
thanks
to
God:
for
all
joined
together,
the
Laconians
and
the
other
captains
and
the
under-officers
and
the
soldiers,
and
gave
him
the
choice
of
horses
and
oxen
and
everything;
so
he
was
now
well
able
to
do
a
good
turn
to
another.
Then
Thibron
arrived
and
took
over
the
army,
which
he
mingled
with
the
rest
of
the
Hellenic
forces,
and
marched
to
the
war
against
Tissaphernes
and
Pharnabazos.
NOTE
BY
AN
ANCIENT
EDITOR
The
distance
of
the
whole
journey,
up
country
and
down
country,
was
215
stages,
1,150
leagues,
34,255
stades,
or
about
3,360
geographic
miles.
The
time
taken
was
one
year
and
three
months.
