When
they
had
crossed,
they
formed
up
together
about
midday
and
marched
through
Armenia,
all
plain
and
smooth
little
hills,
not
less
than
five
leagues;
for
there
were
no
villages
near
the
river,
because
of
their
wars
with
the
Kurds.
But
the
village
they
reached
was
large
and
had
a
palace
for
the
governor,
and
towers
over
most
of
the
houses;
provisions
in
abundance.
From
there
they
marched
two
stages,
10
leagues,
until
they
reached
the
source
of
the
Tigris
River.
From
there
they
marched
three
stages,
15
leagues,
to
the
River
Teleboas;
a
fine
river,
but
not
large,
and
there
were
many
villages
about
the
river.
This
district
was
called
Southern
Armenia;
the
lieutenant-governor
was
Tiribazos,
the
King’s
Friend,
and
his
was
the
right
to
mount
the
king
on
horseback
when
he
was
present.
This
man
rode
up
with
a
troop
of
horse,
and
sent
forward
an
interpreter
to
say
he
wished
to
parley
with
the
commanders.
The
captains
decided
to
hear
him,
and
coming
within
hearing,
they
asked
what
he
wished.
He
replied
that
he
wished
for
a
truce,
on
these
terms:
he
would
not
damage
the
Hellenes,
and
they
should
not
burn
the
houses,
but
take
what
provisions
they
needed.
The
captains
agreed,
and
a
truce
was
made
on
those
terms.
Thence
they
marched
three
stages
over
the
plain,
15
leagues,
and
Tiribazos
followed
with
his
force
about
a
mile
behind.
Then
they
reached
the
palace,
and
many
villages
round,
full
of
all
sorts
of
provisions.
While
they
were
encamping,
there
came
a
heavy
fall
of
snow;
and
in
the
morning,
it
was
decided
to
billet
the
companies
with
their
captains
among
the
villages,
for
they
saw
no
enemy,
and
it
seemed
to
be
safe
with
all
that
snow.
There
they
had
all
the
good
things
they
wanted:
sacrificial
victims,
corn,
fragrant
old
wines,
raisins,
and
all
kinds
of
vegetables.
But
some
stragglers
from
the
camp
reported
that
they
had
seen
large
numbers
of
fires
in
the
night.
So
billeting
seemed
no
longer
safe;
they
must
assemble
the
army
again,
and
so
they
did.
The
sky
seemed
likely
to
clear
then,
but
while
they
slept,
there
came
snow
without
end
which
covered
the
arms
and
the
men
lying
there.
The
snow
was
a
great
hindrance
to
the
animals,
and
nobody
wanted
to
get
up,
for
it
kept
them
snug
and
warm
where
they
lay
unless
it
slipped
off.
At
last
Xenophon
condescended
to
stand
up
in
his
shirt
and
split
wood,
and
then
one
or
another
got
up
and
pulled
the
log
out
of
his
hands
and
began
to
split;
then
others
got
up
and
lit
fires
and
oiled
themselves.
There
was
plenty
of
oil
there:
hog’s
lard,
oil
from
sesame
and
bitter
almonds,
and
turpentine,
which
they
used
instead
of
olive
oil.
A
balm
also
was
made
from
the
same.
After
this,
they
decided
to
billet
again
under
shelter.
The
men,
with
loud
shouts
of
delight,
rushed
back
to
the
shelter
and
provisions;
and
then
any
who
had
burnt
the
houses
they
left
just
out
of
mischief
were
sorry
for
it
when
they
had
bad
quarters.
The
next
night,
they
sent
Democrates
of
Tenos
with
a
few
men
to
the
mountains
where
stragglers
said
they
had
seen
the
fires;
for
this
man
had
been
found
before
to
bring
truthful
reports,
and
when
he
said
it
was
so,
it
was,
and
when
he
said
it
wasn’t,
it
was
not.
When
he
came
back,
he
said
he
had
seen
no
fires,
but
he
brought
back
a
prisoner
armed
with
a
Persian
bow
and
quiver,
and
a
bill
such
as
the
Amazons
carry.
Questioned,
he
said
he
was
a
Persian
and
that
he
was
foraging
for
provisions
from
the
army
of
Tiribazos.
They
asked
how
large
was
the
army
and
why
it
had
been
formed.
He
replied
that
Tiribazos
had
his
own
force
and
some
mercenaries,
Chalybians
and
Taochians;
said
he
was
prepared
to
fall
on
the
Hellenes
while
they
crossed
the
mountains,
in
narrow
places
with
only
one
road.
The
captains
decided,
on
hearing
this,
to
assemble
the
army.
They
marched
at
once
with
the
man
as
a
guide,
leaving
guards
under
the
command
of
Sophainetos,
a
Stymphalian.
While
they
were
crossing,
the
light-armed
troops,
going
on
before,
caught
sight
of
the
enemy
camp,
and
without
waiting
for
the
heavy
troops,
rushed
on
the
camp
with
loud
shouts.
The
natives,
hearing
the
noise,
did
not
stay;
they
ran
for
it.
But
still,
some
were
killed,
and
horses
were
taken,
about
twenty,
and
the
tent
of
Tiribazos
was
taken,
and
in
it
couches
with
silver
feet,
and
cups,
and
men
who
said
they
were
bakers
and
butlers.
When
the
captains
of
the
heavy-armed
troops
heard
this
report,
they
decided
to
return
to
their
camp
as
quickly
as
they
could
to
prevent
an
assault
on
those
left
behind.
They
sounded
the
recall
and
retired,
and
reached
the
camp
the
same
day.
