Greek: 186 ἐπεὶ τοίνυν τάχιστα τῶν πολιτευομένων ὑπέλαβον κρείττονες εἶναι, Σωκράτει μὲν οὐκέτι προσῇσαν ·
English: So soon, then, as they presumed themselves to be the superiors of the politicians, they no longer came near Socrates.

Greek: 187 οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἄλλως ἤρεσκεν, εἴ τε προσέλθοιεν, ὑπὲρ ὧν ἡμάρτανον ἐλεγχόμενοι ἤχθοντο ·
English: For apart from their general want of sympathy with him, they resented being cross-examined about their errors when they came.

Greek: 188 τὰ δὲ τῆς πόλεως ἔπραττον, ὧνπερ ἕνεκεν καὶ Σωκράτει προσῆλθον.
English: Politics had brought them to Socrates, and for politics they left him.

Greek: 189 ἀλλὰ Κρίτων τε Σωκράτους ἦν ὁμιλητὴς καὶ Χαιρεφῶν καὶ Χαιρεκράτης καὶ Ἑρμογένης καὶ Σιμμίας καὶ Κέβης καὶ Φαιδώνδας καὶ ἄλλοι, οἳ ἐκείνῳ συνῆσαν, οὐχ ἵνα δημηγορικοὶ ἢ δικανικοὶ γένοιντο, ἀλλ’ ἵνα καλοί τε κ- ἀγαθοὶ γενόμενοι καὶ οἴκῳ καὶ οἰκέταις καὶ οἰκείοις καὶ φίλοις καὶ πόλει καὶ πολίταις δύναιντο καλῶς χρῆσθαι.
English: But Criton was a true associate of Socrates, as were Chaerophon, Chaerecrates, Hermogenes, Simmias, Cebes, Phaedondas, and others who consorted with him not that they might shine in the courts or the assembly, but that they might become gentlemen, and be able to do their duty by house and household, and relatives and friends, and city and citizens.

Greek: 190 καὶ τούτων οὐδεὶς οὔτε νεώτερος οὔτε πρεσβύτερος ὢν οὔτ’ ἐποίησε κακὸν οὐδὲν οὔτ’ αἰτίαν ἔσχεν.
English: Of these not one, in his youth or old age, did evil or incurred censure.

Greek: 191 ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε, ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος, τοὺς πατέρας προπηλακίζειν ἐδίδασκε, πείθων μὲν τοὺς συνόντας αὐτῷ σοφωτέρους ποιεῖν τῶν πατέρων, φάσκων δὲ κατὰ νόμον ἐξεῖναι παρανοίας ἑλόντι καὶ τὸν πατέρα δῆσαι, τεκμηρίῳ τούτῳ χρώμενος, ὡς τὸν ἀμαθέστερον ὑπὸ τοῦ σοφωτέρου νόμιμον εἴη δεδέσθαι.
English: But, said his accuser, Socrates taught sons to treat their fathers with contempt: he persuaded them that he made his companions wiser than their fathers: he said that the law allowed a son to put his father in prison if he convinced a jury that he was insane; and this was a proof that it was lawful for the wiser to keep the more ignorant in gaol.

Greek: 192 Σωκράτης δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀμαθίας ἕνεκα δεσμεύοντα δικαίως ἂν καὶ αὐτὸν ᾤετο δεδέσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπισταμένων ἃ μὴ αὐτὸς ἐπίσταται;
English: In reality Socrates held that, if you clap fetters on a man for his ignorance, you deserve to be kept in gaol yourself by those whose knowledge is greater than your own.

Greek: 193 καὶ τῶν τοιούτων ἕνεκα πολλάκις ἐσκόπει, τί διαφέρει μανίας ἀμαθία;
English: And such reasoning led him frequently to consider the difference between Madness and Ignorance.

Greek: 194 καὶ τοὺς μὲν μαινομένους ᾤετο συμφερόντως ἂν δεδέσθαι καὶ ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς φίλοις, τοὺς δὲ μὴ ἐπισταμένους τὰ δέοντα δικαίως ἂν μανθάνειν παρὰ τῶν ἐπισταμένων.
English: That madmen should be kept in prison was expedient, he thought, both for themselves and for their friends: but those who are ignorant of what they ought to know deserve to learn from those who know it.

Greek: 195 ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε, ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος, οὐ μόνον τοὺς πατέρας ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους συγγενεῖς ἐποίει ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ εἶναι παρὰ τοῖς ἑαυτῷ συνοῦσι, λέγων ὡς οὔτε τοὺς κάμνοντας οὔτε τοὺς δικαζομένους οἱ συγγενεῖς ὠφελοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν οἱ ἰατροί, τοὺς δὲ οἱ συνδικεῖν ἐπιστάμενοι.
English: But, said his accuser, Socrates caused his companions to dishonour not only their fathers, but their other relations as well, by saying that invalids and litigants get benefit not from their relations, but from their doctor or their counsel.

Greek: 196 ἔφη δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν φίλων αὐτὸν λέγειν ὡς οὐδὲν ὄφελος εὔνους εἶναι, εἰ μὴ καὶ ὠφελεῖν δυνήσονται.
English: Of friends too he said that their goodwill was worthless, unless they could combine with it some power to help one.

Greek: 197 μόνους δὲ φάσκειν αὐτὸν ἀξίους εἶναι τιμῆς τοὺς εἰδότας τὰ δέοντα καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι δυναμένους.
English: Only those deserved honour who knew what was the right thing to do, and could explain it.

Greek: 198 ἀναπείθοντα οὖν τοὺς νέους αὐτόν, ὡς αὐτὸς εἴη σοφώτατός τε καὶ ἄλλους ἱκανώτατος ποιῆσαι σοφούς, οὕτω διατιθέναι τοὺς ἑαυτῷ συνόντας, ὥστε μηδαμοῦ παρ' αὐτοῖς τοὺς ἄλλους εἶναι πρὸς ἑαυτόν.
English: Thus by leading the young to think that he excelled in wisdom and in ability to make others wise, he had such an effect on his companions that no one counted for anything in their estimation in comparison with him.

Greek: 199 ἐγὼ δ' αὐτὸν οἶδα μὲν καὶ περὶ πατέρων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συγγενῶν τε καὶ περὶ φίλων ταῦτα λέγοντα.
English: Now I know that he did use this

 language about fathers, relations and friends.

Greek: 200 καὶ πρὸς τούτοις γε δή, ὅτι τῆς ψυχῆς ἐξελθούσης, ἐν ᾗ μόνῃ γίγνεται φρόνησις, τὸ σῶμα τοῦ οἰκειοτάτου ἀνθρώπου τὴν ταχίστην ἐξενέγκαντες ἀφανίζουσιν.
English: And, what is more, he would say that so soon as the soul, the only seat of intelligence, is gone out of a man, even though he be our nearest and dearest, we carry out his body and hide it in the tomb.

Greek: 201 ἔλεγε δ' ὅτι καὶ ζῶν ἕκαστος ἑαυτοῦ, ὃ πάντων μάλιστα φιλεῖ, τοῦ σώματος ὅ τι ἂν ἀχρεῖον ᾖ καὶ ἀνωφελές, αὐτός τε ἀφαιρεῖ καὶ ἄλλῳ παρέχει.
English: Moreover, a man’s dearest friend is himself: yet, even in his lifetime he removes or lets another remove from his body whatever is useless and unprofitable.

Greek: 202 αὐτοί τέ γε αὑτῶν ὄνυχάς τε καὶ τρίχας καὶ τύλους ἀφαιροῦσι καὶ τοῖς ἰατροῖς παρέχουσι μετὰ πόνων τε καὶ ἀλγηδόνων καὶ ἀποτέμνειν καὶ ἀποκάειν, καὶ τούτων χάριν οἴονται δεῖν αὐτοῖς καὶ μισθὸν τίνειν.
English: He removes his own nails, hair, corns: he lets the surgeon cut and cauterize him, and, aches and pains notwithstanding, feels bound to thank and fee him for it.

Greek: 203 καὶ τὸ σίαλον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἀποπτύουσιν ὡς δύνανται πορρωτάτω, διότι ὠφελεῖ μὲν οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς ἐνόν, βλάπτει δὲ πολὺ μᾶλλον.
English: He spits out the saliva from his mouth as far away as he can, because to retain it doesn’t help him, but harms him rather.

Greek: 204 ταῦτ' οὖν ἔλεγεν οὐ τὸν μὲν πατέρα ζῶντα κατορύττειν διδάσκων, ἑαυτὸν δὲ κατατέμνειν, ἀλλ' ἐπιδεικνύων ὅτι τὸ ἄφρον ἄτιμόν ἐστι παρεκάλει ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τοῦ ὡς φρονιμώτατον εἶναι καὶ ὠφελιμώτατον, ὅπως, ἐάν τε ὑπὸ πατρὸς ἐάν τε ὑπὸ ἀδελφοῦ ἐάν τε ὑπ' ἄλλου τινὸς βούληται τιμᾶσθαι, μὴ τῷ οἰκεῖος εἶναι πιστεύων ἀμελῇ, ἀλλὰ πειρᾶται, ὑφ' ὧν ἂν βούληται τιμᾶσθαι, τούτοις ὠφέλιμος εἶναι.
English: Now in saying all this, he was not giving a lesson on the duty of burying one’s father alive, or making mincemeat of one’s body: he meant to show that unreason is unworth, and was urging the necessity of cultivating sound sense and usefulness, in order that he who would fain be valued by father or by brother or by anyone else may not rely on the bond of familiarity and neglect him, but may try to be useful to all those by whom he would be valued.

Greek: 205 ἔφη δ’ αὐτὸν ὁ κατήγορος καὶ τῶν ἐνδοξοτάτων ποιητῶν ἐκλεγόμενον τὰ πονηρότατα καὶ τούτοις μαρτυρίοις χρώμενον διδάσκειν τοὺς συνόντας κακούργους τε εἶναι καὶ τυραννικούς, Ἡσιόδου μὲν τὸ ἔργον δ’ οὐδὲν ὄνειδος, ἀεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος.
English: Again, his accuser alleged that he selected from the most famous poets the most immoral passages, and used them as evidence in teaching his companions to be tyrants and malefactors: for example, Hesiod’s line: "No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace."

Greek: 206 τοῦτο δὴ λέγειν αὐτόν, ὡς ὁ ποιητὴς κελεύει μηδενὸς ἔργου μήτ’ ἀδίκου μήτ’ αἰσχροῦ ἀπέχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ ταῦτα ποιεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ κέρδει.
English: He was charged with explaining this line as an injunction to refrain from no work, dishonest or disgraceful, but to do anything for gain.

Greek: 207 Σωκράτης δ’ ἐπεὶ διομολογήσαιτο τὸ μὲν ἐργάτην εἶναι ὠφέλιμόν τε ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ ἀγαθὸν εἶναι, τὸ δὲ ἀργὸν βλαβερόν τε καὶ κακόν, καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐργάζεσθαι ἀγαθόν, τὸ δ’ ἀργεῖν κακόν, τοὺς μὲν ἀγαθόν τι ποιοῦντας ἐργάζεσθαί τε ἔφη καὶ ἐργάτας ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι, τοὺς δὲ κυβεύοντας ἤ τι ἄλλο πονηρὸν καὶ ἐπιζήμιον ποιοῦντας ἀργοὺς ἀπεκάλει.
English: Now, though Socrates would fully agree that it is a benefit and a blessing to a man to be a worker, and a disadvantage and an evil to be an idler — that work, in fact, is a blessing, idleness an evil — working, being a worker, meant to him doing good work; but gambling and any occupation that is immoral and leads to loss he called idling. 

Greek: 208 ἐκ δὲ τούτων ὀρθῶς ἂν ἔχοι τὸ ἔργον δ’ οὐδὲν ὄνειδο

ς, ἀεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος.
English: When thus interpreted there is nothing amiss with the line: "No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace."

Greek: 209 τὸ δὲ Ὀμήρου ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος πολλάκις αὐτὸν λέγειν, ὅτι Ὀδυσσεὺς ὅντινα μὲν βασιλῆα καὶ ἔξοχον ἄνδρα κιχείη, τὸν δ’ ἀγανοῖς ἐπέεσσιν ἐρητύσασκε παραστάς.
English: Again, his accuser said that he often quoted the passage from Homer, showing how Odysseus: "Whenever he found one that was a captain and a man of mark, stood by his side, and restrained him with gentle words."

Greek: 210 δαιμόνι’, οὔ σε ἔοικε κακὸν ὣς δειδίσσεσθαι, ἀλλ’ αὐτός τε κάθησο καὶ ἄλλους ἵδρυε λαούς.
211 ὃν δ’ αὖ δήμου τ’ ἄνδρα ἴδοι βοόωντά τ’ ἐφεύροι, τὸν σκήπτρῳ ἐλάσασκεν ὁμοκλήσασκέ τε μύθῳ.
212 δαιμόνι’, ἀτρέμας ἧσο, καὶ ἄλλων μῦθον ἄκουε, οἳ σέο φέρτεροί εἰσι. σὺ δ’ ἀπτόλεμος καὶ ἄναλκις, οὔτε ποτ’ ἐν πολέμῳ ἐναρίθμιος οὔτ’ ἐνὶ βουλῇ.
English: But whatever man of the people he saw and found him shouting, him he drove with his sceptre and chid him with loud words: "Good sir, sit still and hearken to the words of others that are thy betters: but thou art no warrior and a weakling, never reckoned whether in battle or in council."

Greek: 213 σὺ δ’ ἀπτόλεμος καὶ ἄναλκις, οὔτε ποτ’ ἐν πολέμῳ ἐναρίθμιος οὔτ’ ἐνὶ βουλῇ.
214 ταῦτα δὴ αὐτὸν ἐξηγεῖσθαι, ὡς ὁ ποιητὴς ἐπαινοίη παίεσθαι τοὺς δημότας καὶ πένητας.
English: This passage, it was said, he explained to mean that the poet approved of chastising common and poor folk.

Greek: 215	Σωκράτης δ’ οὐ ταῦτ’ ἔλεγε ·
English: But Socrates never said that.

Greek: 216	καὶ γὰρ ἑαυτὸν οὕτω γ’ ἂν ᾤετο δεῖν παίεσθαι ·
English: Indeed, on that view he would have thought himself worthy of chastisement.

Greek: 217	ἀλλ’ ἔφη δεῖν τοὺς μήτε λόγῳ μήτ’ ἔργῳ ὠφελίμους ὄντας μήτε στρατεύματι μήτε πόλει μήτε αὐτῷ τῷ δήμῳ, εἴ τι δέοι, βοηθεῖν ἱκανούς, ἄλλως τ’ ἐὰν πρὸς τούτῳ καὶ θρασεῖς ὦσι, πάντα τρόπον κωλύεσθαι, κἂν πάνυ πλούσιοι τυγχάνωσιν ὄντες.
English: But what he did say was that those who render no service either by word or deed, who cannot help army or city or the people itself in time of need, ought to be stopped, even if they have riches in abundance, especially if they are insolent as well as inefficient.

Greek: 218	ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε τ- ἐναντία τούτων φανερὸς ἦν καὶ δημοτικὸς καὶ φιλάνθρωπος ὤν.
English: But Socrates was just the opposite of all that, showing himself to be one of the people and a friend of mankind.

Greek: 219	ἐκεῖνος γὰρ πολλοὺς ἐπιθυμητὰς καὶ ἀστοὺς καὶ ξένους λαβὼν οὐδένα πώποτε μισθὸν τῆς συνουσίας ἐπράξατο, ἀλλὰ πᾶσιν ἀφθόνως ἐπήρκει τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ·
English: For although he had many eager disciples among citizens and strangers, yet he never exacted a fee for his society from one of them, but of his abundance he gave without stint to all.

Greek: 220	ὧν τινες μικρὰ μέρη παρ’ ἐκείνου προῖκα λαβόντες πολλοῦ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπώλουν, καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνος δημοτικοί ·
English: Some indeed, after getting from him a few trifles for nothing, became vendors of them at a great price to others.

Greek: 221	τοῖς γὰρ μὴ ἔχουσι χρήματα διδόναι οὐκ ἤθελον διαλέγεσθαι.
English:  For they showed none of his sympathy with the people, refusing to talk with those who had no money to give them.

Greek: 222	ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους κόσμον τῇ πόλει παρεῖχε πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἢ Λίχας τῇ Λακεδαιμονίων, ὃς ὀνομαστὸς ἐπὶ τούτῳ γέγονε.
English: But Socrates did far more to win respect for the State in the world at large than Lichas, whose services to Sparta have made his name immortal. 

Greek: 223	Λίχας μὲν γὰρ ταῖς γυμνοπαιδίαις τοὺς ἐπιδημοῦντας ἐν Λακεδαίμονι ξένους ἐδείπνιζε, Σωκράτης δὲ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ βίου τὰ ἑαυτοῦ δαπανῶν τὰ μέγιστα πάντας τοὺς βουλομένους ὠφέλει.
English: For Lichas used to entertain the strangers staying at Sparta during the Feast of the Dancing Boys; but Socrates spent his life in lavishing his gifts and rendering the greatest services to all who cared to receive them.

Greek: 224	βελτίους γὰρ ποιῶν τοὺς συγγιγνομένους ἀπέπεμπεν.
English: For he always made his associates better men before he parted with them.

Greek: 225	ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ Σωκράτης τοιοῦτος ὢν ἐδόκει τιμῆς ἄξιος εἶναι τῇ πόλει μᾶλλον ἢ θανάτου.
English: To me, he seemed to deserve honour rather than death at the hands of the State.

Greek: 226	καὶ κατὰ τοὺς νόμους δὲ σκοπῶν ἄν τις τοῦθ’ εὕροι.
English: And a consideration of his case in its legal aspect will confirm my opinion.

Greek: 227	κατὰ γὰρ τοὺς νόμους, ἐάν τις φανερὸς γένηται κλέπτων ἢ λωποδυτῶν ἢ βαλλαντιοτομῶν ἢ τοιχωρυχῶν ἢ ἀνδραποδιζόμενος ἢ ἱεροσυλῶν, τούτοις θάνατός ἐστιν ἡ ζημία.
English: Under the laws, death is the penalty inflicted on persons proved to be thieves, highwaymen, cutpurses, kidnappers, robbers of temples.

Greek: 228	ὧν ἐκεῖνος πάντων ἀνθρώπων πλεῖστον ἀπεῖχεν.
English: And from such criminals no man was so widely separated as he.

Greek: 229	ἀλλὰ μὴν τῇ πόλει γε οὔτε πολέμου κακῶς συμβάντος οὔτε στάσεως οὔτε προδοσίας οὔτε ἄλλου κακοῦ οὐδενὸς πώποτε αἴτιος ἐγένετο.
English: Moreover, to the State he was never the cause of disaster in war, or strife or treason or any evil whatever.

Greek: 230	οὐδὲ μὴν ἰδίᾳ γε οὐδένα πώποτε ἀνθρώπων οὔτε ἀγαθῶν ἀπεστέρησεν οὔτε κακοῖς περιέβαλεν, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ αἰτίαν τῶν εἰρημένων οὐδενὸς πώποτ’ ἔσχε.
English: Again, in private life no man by him was ever deprived of good or involved in ill. None of these crimes was ever so much as imputed to him. 

Greek: 231	πῶς οὖν ἂν ἔνοχος εἴη τῇ γραφῇ;
English: How then could he be guilty of the charges?

Greek: 232	ὃς ἀντὶ μὲν τοῦ μὴ νομίζειν θεούς, ὡς ἐν τῇ γραφῇ ἐγέγραπτο, φανερὸς ἦν θεραπεύων τοὺς θεοὺς μάλιστα τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων, ἀντὶ δὲ τοῦ διαφθείρειν τοὺς νέους, ὃ δὴ ὁ γραψάμενος αὐτὸν ᾐτιᾶτο, φανερὸς ἦν τῶν συνόντων τοὺς πονηρὰς ἐπιθυμίας ἔχοντας τούτων μὲν παύων, τῆς δὲ καλλίστης καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεστάτης ἀρετῆς, ᾗ πόλεις τε καὶ οἶκοι εὖ οἰκοῦσι, προτρέπων ἐπιθυμεῖν.
English: For so far was he from rejecting the gods, as charged in the indictment, that no man was more conspicuous for his devotion to the service of the gods: so far from corrupting the youth, as his accuser actually charged against him, that if any among his companions had evil desires, he openly tried to reform them and exhorted them to desire the fairest and noblest virtue, by which men prosper in public life and in their homes.

Greek: 233	ταῦτα δὲ πράττων πῶς οὐ μεγάλης ἄξιος ἦν τιμῆς τῇ πόλει;
English: By this conduct did he not deserve high honour from the State?

Greek: 234	ὡς δὲ δὴ καὶ ὠφελεῖν ἐδόκει μοι τοὺς συνόντας τὰ μὲν ἔργῳ δεικνύων ἑαυτὸν οἷος ἦν, τὰ δὲ καὶ διαλεγόμενος, τούτων δὴ γράψω ὁπόσα ἂν διαμνημονεύσω.
English: In order to support my opinion that he benefited his companions, alike by actions that revealed his own character and by his conversation, I will set down what I recollect of these.

Greek: 235	τὰ μὲν τοίνυν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς φανερὸς ἦν καὶ ποιῶν καὶ λέγων ᾗπερ ἡ Πυθία ἀποκρίνεται τοῖς ἐρωτῶσι πῶς δεῖ ποιεῖν ἢ περὶ θυσίας ἢ περὶ προγόνων θεραπείας ἢ περὶ ἄλλου τινὸς τῶν τοιούτων.
English: First, then, for his attitude towards religion; his deeds and words were clearly in harmony with the answer given by the Priestess at Delphi to such questions as "What is my duty about sacrifice?" or about "cult of ancestors."

Greek: 236	ἥ τε γὰρ Πυθία νόμῳ πόλεως ἀναιρεῖ ποιοῦντας εὐσεβῶς ἂν ποιεῖν, Σωκράτης τε οὕτω καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίει καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις παρῄνει, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλως πως ποιοῦντας περιέργους καὶ ματαίους ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι.
English: For the answer of the Priestess is, "Follow the custom of the State: that is the way to act piously." And so Socrates acted himself and counselled others to act. To take any other course he considered presumption and folly.

Greek: 237	καὶ ηὔχετο δὲ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ἁπλῶς τ- ἀγαθὰ διδόναι, ὡς τοὺς θεοὺς κάλλιστα εἰδότας ὁποῖα ἀγαθά ἐστι.
English: And again, when he prayed he asked simply for good gifts, "for the gods know best what things are good."

Greek: 238	τοὺς δ’ εὐχομένους χρυσίον ἢ ἀργύριον ἢ τυραννίδα ἢ ἄλλο τι τῶν τοιούτων οὐδὲν διάφορον ἐνόμιζεν εὔχεσθαι ἢ εἰ κυβείαν ἢ μάχην ἢ ἄλλο τι εὔχοιντο τῶν φανερῶς ἀδήλων ὅπως ἀποβήσοιτο.
English: To pray for gold or silver or sovereignty or any other such thing, was just like praying for a gamble or a fight or anything of which the result is obviously uncertain.

Greek: 239	θυσίας δὲ θύων μικρὰς ἀπὸ μικρῶν οὐδὲν ἡγεῖτο μειοῦσθαι τῶν ἀπὸ πολλῶν καὶ μεγάλων πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα θυόντων.
English: Though his sacrifices were humble, according to his means, he thought himself not a whit inferior to those who made frequent and magnificent sacrifices out of great possessions.

Greek: 240	οὔτε γὰρ τοῖς θεοῖς ἔφη καλῶς ἔχειν, εἰ ταῖς μεγάλαις θυσίαις μᾶλλον ἢ ταῖς μικραῖς ἔχαιρον.
English: The gods (he said) could not well delight more in great offerings than in small.

Greek: 241	πολλάκις γὰρ ἂν αὐτοῖς τὰ παρὰ τῶν πονηρῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν χρηστῶν εἶναι κεχαρισμένα.
English: For in that case must the gifts of the wicked often have found more favour in their sight than the gifts of the upright.

Greek: 242	οὔτ’ ἂν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἄξιον εἶναι ζῆν, εἰ τὰ παρὰ τῶν πονηρῶν μᾶλλον ἦν κεχαρισμένα τοῖς θεοῖς ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν χρηστῶν.
English: And man would not find life worth having, if the gifts of the wicked were received with more favour by the gods than the gifts of the upright.

Greek: 243	ἀλλ’ ἐνόμιζε τοὺς θεοὺς ταῖς παρὰ τῶν εὐσεβεστάτων τιμαῖς μάλιστα χαίρειν.
English: No, the greater the piety of the giver, the greater (he thought) was the delight of the gods in the gift.

Greek: 244	ἐπαινέτης δ’ ἦν καὶ τοῦ ἔπους τούτου ·
English: He would quote with approval the line.

Greek: 245	καδδύναμιν δ’ ἔρδειν ἱέρ’ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, καὶ πρὸς φίλους δὲ καὶ ξένους καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἄλλην δίαιταν καλὴν ἔφη παραίνεσιν εἶναι τὴν καδδύναμιν δ’ ἔρδειν.
English: "According to thy power render sacrifice to the immortal gods," and he would add that in our treatment of friends and strangers, and in all our behaviour, it is a noble principle to render according to our power.

Greek: 246	εἰ δέ τι δόξειεν αὐτῷ σημαίνεσθαι παρὰ τῶν θεῶν, ἧττον ἂν ἐπείσθη παρὰ τὰ σημαινόμενα ποιῆσαι ἢ εἴ τις αὐτὸν ἔπειθεν ὁδοῦ λαβεῖν ἡγεμόνα τυφλὸν καὶ μὴ εἰδότα τὴν ὁδὸν ἀντὶ βλέποντος καὶ εἰδότος.
English: If ever any warning seemed to be given him from heaven, he would more easily have been persuaded to choose a blind guide who did not know the road in preference to one who could see and knew the way, than to disregard the admonition.

Greek: 247	καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δὲ μωρίαν κατηγόρει, οἵτινες παρὰ τὰ ὑπὸ τῶν θεῶν σημαινόμενα ποιοῦσί τι, φυλαττόμενοι τὴν παρὰ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἀδοξίαν.
English: All men, in fact, who flouted the warnings of the gods in their anxiety to avoid the censure of men, he denounced for their foolishness.

Greek: 248	αὐτὸς δὲ πάντα τ- ἀνθρώπινα ὑπερεώρα πρὸς τὴν παρὰ τῶν θεῶν συμβουλίαν.
English: He himself despised all human opinions in comparison with counsel given by the gods.

Greek: 249	διαίτῃ δὲ τήν τε ψυχὴν ἐπαίδευσε καὶ τὸ σῶμα ᾗ χρώμενος ἄν τις, εἰ μή τι δαιμόνιον εἴη, θαρραλέως καὶ ἀσφαλῶς διάγοι καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἀπορήσειε τοσαύτης δαπάνης.
English: He schooled his body and soul by following a system which, in all human calculation, would give him a life of confidence and security, and would make it easy to meet his expenses.

Greek: 250	οὕτω γὰρ εὐτελὴς ἦν, ὥστ’ οὐκ οἶδ’ εἴ τις οὕτως ἂν ὀλίγα ἐργάζοιτο ὥστε μὴ λαμβάνειν τὰ Σωκράτει ἀρκοῦντα.
English: For he was so frugal that it is hardly possible to imagine a man doing so little work as not to earn enough to satisfy the needs of Socrates.

Greek: 251	σίτῳ μὲν γὰρ τοσούτῳ ἐχρῆτο, ὅσον ἡδέως ἤσθιε, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦτο οὕτω παρεσκευασμένος ᾔει ὥστε τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν τοῦ σίτου ὄψον αὐτῷ εἶναι.
English: He ate just sufficient food to make eating a pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found appetite the best sauce.

Greek: 252	ποτὸν δὲ πᾶν ἡδὺ ἦν αὐτῷ διὰ τὸ μὴ πίνειν, εἰ μὴ διψῴη.
English: And any kind of drink he found pleasant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.

Greek: 253	εἰ δέ ποτε κληθεὶς ἐθελήσειεν ἐπὶ δεῖπνον ἐλθεῖν, ὃ τοῖς πλείστοις ἐργωδέστατόν ἐστιν, ὥστε φυλάξασθαι τὸ ὑπὲρ τὸν κόρον ἐμπίμπλασθαι, τοῦτο ῥᾳδίως πάνυ ἐφυλάττετο.
English: Whenever he accepted an invitation to dinner, he resisted without difficulty the common temptation to exceed the limit of satiety.

Greek: 254	τοῖς δὲ μὴ δυναμένοις τοῦτο ποιεῖν συνεβούλευε φυλάττεσθαι τὰ πείθοντα μὴ πεινῶντας ἐσθίειν μηδὲ διψῶντας πίνειν.
English: And he advised those who could not do likewise to

 avoid appetizers that encouraged them to eat and drink what they did not want.

Greek: 255	καὶ γὰρ τὰ λυμαινόμενα γαστέρας καὶ κεφαλὰς καὶ ψυχὰς ταῦτ’ ἔφη εἶναι.
English: For such trash was the ruin of stomach and brain and soul.

Greek: 256	οἴεσθαι δ’ ἔφη ἐπισκώπτων καὶ τὴν Κίρκην ὗς ποιεῖν τοιούτοις πολλοῖς δειπνίζουσαν.
English: I believe, he said in jest, it was by providing a feast of such things that Circe made swine.

Greek: 257	τὸν δὲ Ὀδυσσέα Ἑρμοῦ τε ὑποθημοσύνῃ καὶ αὐτὸν ἐγκρατῆ ὄντα καὶ ἀποσχόμενον τοῦ ὑπὲρ τὸν κόρον τῶν τοιούτων ἅπτεσθαι, διὰ ταῦτα οὐ γενέσθαι ὗν.
English: And it was partly by the prompting of Hermes, partly through his own self-restraint and avoidance of excessive indulgence in such things, that Odysseus was not turned into a pig.

Greek: 258	τοιαῦτα μὲν περὶ τούτων ἔπαιζεν ἅμα σπουδάζων.
English: This was how he would talk on the subject, half joking, half in earnest.

Greek: 259	ἀφροδισίων δὲ παρῄνει τῶν καλῶν ἰσχυρῶς ἀπέχεσθαι;
English: Of sensual passion he would say: "Avoid it resolutely: 

Greek: 260	οὐ γὰρ ἔφη ῥᾴδιον εἶναι τῶν τοιούτων ἁπτόμενον σωφρονεῖν.
English: it is not easy to control yourself once you meddle with that sort of thing."

Greek: 261	ἀλλὰ καὶ Κριτόβουλόν ποτε τὸν Κρίτωνος πυθόμενος ὅτι ἐφίλησε τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδου υἱὸν καλὸν ὄντα, παρόντος τοῦ Κριτοβούλου ἤρετο Ξενοφῶντα.
English: Thus, on hearing that Critobulus had kissed Alcibiades’ pretty boy, he put this question to Xenophon before Critobulus.

Greek: 262	εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Ξενοφῶν, οὐ σὺ Κριτόβουλον ἐνόμιζες εἶναι τῶν σωφρονικῶν ἀνθρώπων μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν θρασέων καὶ τῶν προνοητικῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν ἀνοήτων τε καὶ ῥιψοκινδύνων;
English: "Tell me, Xenophon, did you not suppose Critobulus to be a sober person, and by no means rash; prudent, and not thoughtless or adventurous?"

Greek: 263	πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν.
English: "Certainly," said Xenophon.

Greek: 264	νῦν τοίνυν νόμιζε αὐτὸν θερμουργότατον εἶναι καὶ λεωργότατον.
English: "Then you are to look on him henceforth as utterly hot-headed and reckless."

Greek: 265	οὗτος κἂν εἰς μαχαίρας κυβιστήσειε κἂν εἰς πῦρ ἅλοιτο.
English: "The man would do a somersault into a ring of knives; he would jump into fire."

Greek: 266	καὶ τί δή, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, ἰδὼν ποιοῦντα τοιαῦτα κατέγνωκας αὐτοῦ;
English: "What on earth has he done to make you think so badly of him?" asked Xenophon.

Greek: 267	οὐ γὰρ οὗτος, ἔφη, ἐτόλμησε τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδου υἱὸν φιλῆσαι, ὄντα εὐπροσωπότατον καὶ ὡραιότατον?
English: "What has the man done? He dared to kiss Alcibiades’ son, and the boy is very good-looking and attractive."

Greek: 268	ἀλλ’ εἰ μέντοι, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, τοιοῦτόν ἐστι τὸ ῥιψοκίνδυνον ἔργον, κἂν ἐγὼ δοκῶ μοι τὸν κίνδυνον τοῦτον ὑπομεῖναι.
English: "Oh, if that is the sort of adventure you mean, I think I might make that venture myself."

Greek: 269	ὦ τλῆμον, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, καὶ τί ἂν οἴει παθεῖν καλὸν φιλήσας;
English: "What do you think will happen to you through kissing a pretty face?"

Greek: 270	ἆρ’ οὐκ ἂν αὐτίκα μάλα δοῦλος μὲν εἶναι ἀντ’ ἐλευθέρου, πολλὰ δὲ δαπανᾶν εἰς βλαβερὰς ἡδονάς, πολλὴν δὲ ἀσχολίαν ἔχειν τοῦ ἐπιμεληθῆναί τινος καλοῦ κ- ἀγαθοῦ, σπουδάζειν δ’ ἀναγκασθῆναι ἐφ’ οἷς οὐδ’ ἂν μαινόμενος σπουδάσειεν;
English: "Won’t you lose your liberty in a trice and become a slave, begin spending large sums on harmful pleasures, have no time to give to anything fit for a gentleman, be forced to concern yourself with things that no madman even would care about?"

Greek: 271	ὦ Ἡράκλεις, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, ὡς δεινήν τινα λέγεις δύναμιν τοῦ φιλήματος εἶναι.
English: "Heracles! what alarming power in a kiss!" cried Xenophon.

Greek: 272	καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, θαυμάζεις;
English: "What? Does that surprise you?" continued Socrates.

Greek: 273	οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι τὰ φαλάγγια οὐδ’ ἡμιωβελιαῖα τὸ μέγεθος ὄντα προσαψάμενα μόνον τῷ στόματι ταῖς τε ὀδύναις ἐπιτρίβει τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ τοῦ φρονεῖν ἐξίστησι;
English: "Don’t you know that the scorpion, though smaller than a farthing, if it but fasten on the tongue, inflicts excruciating and maddening pain?"

Greek: 274	ναὶ μὰ Δί’, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν;  

Greek: 275	ἐνίησι γάρ τι τὰ φαλάγγια κατὰ τὸ δῆγμα.
English: "Yes, to be sure;
English: for the scorpion injects something by its bite," said Xenophon.

Greek: 276	ὦ μῶρε, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, τοὺς δὲ καλοὺς οὐκ οἴει φιλοῦντας ἐνιέναι τι, ὅτι σὺ οὐχ ὁρᾷς;
English: "And do you think, you foolish fellow, that the fair inject nothing when they kiss, just because you don’t see it?"

Greek: 277	οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι τοῦτο τὸ θηρίον, ὃ καλοῦσι καλὸν καὶ ὡραῖον, τοσούτῳ δεινότερόν ἐστι τῶν φαλαγγίων, ὅσῳ ἐκεῖνα μὲν ἁψάμενα, τοῦτο δὲ οὐδ’ ἁπτόμενον, ἐάν τις αὐτὸ θεᾶται, ἐνίησί τι καὶ πάνυ πρόσωθεν τοιοῦτον ὥστε μαίνεσθαι ποιεῖν;
English: "Don’t you know that this creature called ‘fair and young’ is more dangerous than the scorpion, seeing that it need not even come in contact, like the insect, but at any distance can inject a maddening poison into anyone who only looks at it?"

Greek: 278	ἴσως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἔρωτες τοξόται διὰ τοῦτο καλοῦνται, ὅτι καὶ πρόσωθεν οἱ καλοὶ τιτρώσκουσιν.
English: "Maybe, too, the loves are called archers for this reason, that the fair can wound even at a distance."

Greek: 279	ἀλλὰ συμβουλεύω σοι, ὦ Ξενοφῶν, ὁπόταν ἴδῃς τινὰ καλόν, φεύγειν προτροπάδην.
English: "Nay, I advise you, Xenophon, as soon as you see a pretty face to take to your heels and fly."

Greek: 280	σοὶ δ’, ὦ Κριτόβουλε, συμβουλεύω ἀπενιαυτίσαι· 
English: "And you, Critobulus, I advise to spend a year abroad. 

Greek: 281	μόλις γὰρ ἂν ἴσως ἐν τοσούτῳ χρόνῳ τὸ δῆγμα ὑγιὴς γένοιο.
English: It will certainly take you at least as long as that to recover from the bite."

Greek: 282	οὕτω δὴ καὶ ἀφροδισιάζειν τοὺς μὴ ἀσφαλῶς ἔχοντας πρὸς ἀφροδίσια ᾤετο χρῆναι πρὸς τοιαῦτα , οἷα μὴ πάνυ μὲν δεομένου τοῦ σώματος οὐκ ἂν προσδέξαιτο ἡ ψυχή , δεομένου δὲ οὐκ ἂν πράγματα παρέχοι .
English: Thus in the matter of carnal appetite, he held that those whose passions were not under complete control should limit themselves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm when the need was there.

Greek: 283	αὐτὸς δὲ πρὸς ταῦτα φανερὸς ἦν οὕτω παρεσκευασμένος ὥστε ῥᾷον ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν καλλίστων καὶ ὡραιοτάτων ἢ οἱ ἄλλοι τῶν αἰσχίστων καὶ ἀωροτάτων .
English: As for his own conduct in this matter, it was evident that he had trained himself to avoid the fairest and most attractive more easily than others avoid the ugliest and most repulsive.

Greek: 284	περὶ μὲν δὴ βρώσεως καὶ πόσεως καὶ ἀφροδισίων οὕτω κατεσκευασμένος ἦν καὶ ᾤετο οὐδὲν ἂν ἧττον ἀρκούντως ἥδεσθαι τῶν πολλὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις πραγματευομένων , λυπεῖσθαι δὲ πολὺ ἔλαττον .
English: Concerning eating and drinking then and carnal indulgence such were his views, and he thought that a due portion of pleasure would be no more lacking to him than to those who give themselves much to these, and that much less trouble would fall to his lot.

Greek: 285	εἰ δέ τινες Σωκράτην νομίζουσιν , ὡς ἔνιοι γράφουσί τε καὶ λέγουσι περὶ αὐτοῦ τεκμαιρόμενοι , προτρέψασθαι μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐπ’ ἀρετὴν κράτιστον γεγονέναι , προαγαγεῖν δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν οὐχ ἱκανόν , σκεψάμενοι μὴ μόνον ἃ ἐκεῖνος κολαστηρίου ἕνεκα τοὺς πάντ’ οἰομένους εἰδέναι ἐρωτῶν ἤλεγχεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἃ λέγων συνημέρευε τοῖς συνδιατρίβουσι , δοκιμαζόντων εἰ ἱκανὸς ἦν βελτίους ποιεῖν τοὺς συνόντας .
English: If any hold the opinion expressed in some written and spoken criticisms of Socrates that are based on inference, and think, that though he was consummate in exhorting men to virtue, he was an incompetent guide to it, let them consider not only the searching cross-examination with which he chastised those who thought themselves omniscient, but his daily talks with his familiar friends, and then judge whether he was capable of improving his companions.

Greek: 286	λέξω δὲ πρῶτον ἅ ποτε αὐτοῦ ἤκουσα περὶ τοῦ δαιμονίου διαλεγομένου πρὸς Ἀριστόδημον τὸν μικρὸν ἐπικαλούμενον .
English: I will first state what I once heard him say about the godhead in conversation with Aristodemus the dwarf, as he was called.

Greek: 287	καταμαθὼν γὰρ αὐτὸν οὔτε θύοντα τοῖς θεοῖς οὔτε μαντικῇ χρώμενον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ποιούντων ταῦτα καταγελῶντα , εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀριστόδημε , ἔστιν οὕστινας ἀνθρώπους τεθαύμακας ἐπὶ σοφίᾳ ;
English: On learning that he was not known to sacrifice or pray or use divination, and actually made a mock of those who did so, he said: Tell me, Aristodemus, do you admire any human beings for wisdom?

Greek: 288	ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη .
English: I do, he answered.

Greek: 289	καὶ ὅς , λέξον ἡμῖν , ἔφη , τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν .
English: Tell us their names.

Greek: 290	ἐπὶ μὲν τοίνυν ἐπῶν ποιήσει Ὅμηρον ἔγωγε μάλιστα τεθαύμακα , ἐπὶ δὲ διθυράμβῳ Μελανιππίδην , ἐπὶ δὲ τραγῳδίᾳ Σοφοκλέα , ἐπὶ δὲ ἀνδριαντοποιίᾳ Πολύκλειτον , ἐπὶ δὲ ζωγραφίᾳ Ζεῦξιν .
English: In epic poetry Homer comes first, in my opinion; in dithyramb, Melanippides; in tragedy, Sophocles; in sculpture, Polycleitus; in painting, Zeuxis.

Greek: 291	πότερά σοι δοκοῦσιν οἱ ἀπεργαζόμενοι εἴδωλα ἄφρονά τε καὶ ἀκίνητα ἀξιοθαυμαστότεροι εἶναι ἢ οἱ ζῷα ἔμφρονά τε καὶ ἐνεργά;
English: Which, think you, deserve the greater admiration, the creators of phantoms without sense and motion, or the creators of living, intelligent, and active beings?

Greek: 292	πολὺ νὴ Δία οἱ ζῷα, εἴπερ γε μὴ τύχῃ τινί, ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ γνώμης ταῦτα γίγνεται.
English: Oh, of living beings, by far, provided only they are created by design and not mere chance.

Greek: 293	τῶν δὲ ἀτεκμάρτως ἐχόντων ὅτου ἕνεκα ἔστι καὶ τῶν φανερῶς ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ ὄντων πότερα τύχης καὶ πότερα γνώμης ἔργα κρίνεις;
English: Suppose that it is impossible to guess the purpose of one creature’s existence, and obvious that another’s serves a useful end, which, in your judgment, is the work of chance, and which of design?

Greek: 294	πρέπει μὲν τὰ ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ γιγνόμενα γνώμης εἶναι ἔργα.
English: Presumably the creature that serves some useful end is the work of design.

Greek: 295	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι ὁ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ποιῶν ἀνθρώπους ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ προσθεῖναι αὐτοῖς δι’ ὧν αἰσθάνονται ἕκαστα, ὀφθαλμοὺς μὲν ὥσθ’ ὁρᾶν τὰ ὁρατά, ὦτα δὲ ὥστ’ ἀκούειν τὰ ἀκουστά;
English: Do you not think then that he who created man from the beginning had some useful end in view when he endowed him with his several senses, giving eyes to see visible objects, ears to hear sounds?


Greek: 296 ὀσμῶν γε μήν, εἰ μὴ ῥῖνες προσετέθησαν, τί ἂν ἡμῖν ὄφελος ἦν;
English: Would odours again be of any use to us had we not been endowed with nostrils?

Greek: 297 τίς δ’ ἂν αἴσθησις ἦν γλυκέων καὶ δριμέων καὶ πάντων τῶν διὰ στόματος ἡδέων, εἰ μὴ γλῶττα τούτων γνώμων ἐνειργάσθη;
English: What perception should we have of sweet and bitter and all things pleasant to the palate had we no tongue in our mouth to discriminate between them?

Greek: 298 πρὸς δὲ τούτοις οὐ δοκεῖ σοι καὶ τάδε προνοίας ἔργοις ἐοικέναι, τὸ ἐπεὶ ἀσθενὴς μέν ἐστιν ἡ ὄψις, βλεφάροις αὐτὴν θυρῶσαι, ἅ, ὅταν μὲν αὐτῇ χρῆσθαί τι δέῃ, ἀναπετάννυται, ἐν δὲ τῷ ὕπνῳ συγκλείεται, ὡς δ’ ἂν μηδὲ ἄνεμοι βλάπτωσιν, ἡθμὸν βλεφαρίδας ἐμφῦσαι, ὀφρύσι τε ἀπογεισῶσαι τὰ ὑπὲρ τῶν ὀμμάτων, ὡς μηδ’ ὁ ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἱδρὼς κακουργῇ;
English: Besides these, are there not other contrivances that look like the results of forethought? Thus the eyeballs, being weak, are set behind eyelids, that open like doors when we want to see, and close when we sleep: on the lids grow lashes through which the very winds filter harmlessly: above the eyes is a coping of brows that lets no drop of sweat from the head hurt them.

Greek: 299 τὸ δὲ τὴν ἀκοὴν δέχεσθαι μὲν πάσας φωνάς, ἐμπίμπλασθαι δὲ μήποτε;
English: The ears catch all sounds, but are never choked with them.

Greek: 300 καὶ τοὺς μὲν πρόσθεν ὀδόντας πᾶσι ζῴοις οἵους τέμνειν εἶναι, τοὺς δὲ γομφίους οἵους παρὰ τούτων δεξαμένους λεαίνειν;
English: Again, the incisors of all creatures are adapted for cutting, the molars for receiving food from them and grinding it.

Greek: 301 καὶ στόμα μέν, δι’ οὗ ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖ τὰ ζῷα εἰσπέμπεται, πλησίον ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ ῥινῶν καταθεῖναι;
English: And again, the mouth, through which the food they want goes in, is set near the eyes and nostrils.

Greek: 302 ἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ ἀποχωροῦντα δυσχερῆ, ἀποστρέψαι τοὺς τούτων ὀχετοὺς καὶ ἀπενεγκεῖν ᾗ δυνατὸν προσωτάτω ἀπὸ τῶν αἰσθήσεων;
English: But since what goes out is unpleasant, the ducts through which it passes are turned away and removed as far as possible from the organs of sense.

Greek: 303 ταῦτα οὕτω προνοητικῶς πεπραγμένα ἀπορεῖς πότερα τύχης ἢ γνώμης ἔργα ἐστίν;
English: With such signs of forethought in these arrangements, can you doubt whether they are the works of chance or design?

Greek: 304 οὐ μὰ τὸν Δί’, ἔφη, ἀλλ’ οὕτω γε σκοπουμένῳ πάνυ ἔοικε ταῦτα σοφοῦ τινος δημιουργοῦ καὶ φιλοζῴου τεχνήμασι.
English: "No, of course not," he said, "but when I regard them in this light they do look very like the handiwork of a wise and loving creator."

Greek: 305 τὸ δὲ ἐμφῦσαι μὲν ἔρωτα τῆς τεκνοποιίας, ἐμφῦσαι δὲ ταῖς γειναμέναις ἔρωτα τοῦ ἐκτρέφειν, τοῖς δὲ τραφεῖσι μέγιστον μὲν πόθον τοῦ ζῆν, μέγιστον δὲ φόβον τοῦ θανάτου;
English: "What of the natural desire to beget children, the mother’s desire to rear her babe, the child’s strong will to live and strong fear of death?"

Greek: 306 ἀμέλει καὶ ταῦτα ἔοικε μηχανήμασί τινος ζῷα εἶναι βουλευσαμένου.
English: "Undoubtedly these, too, look like the contrivances of one who deliberately willed the existence of living creatures."

Greek: 307 σὺ δὲ σαυτῷ δοκεῖς τι φρόνιμον ἔχειν;
English: "Do you think you have any wisdom yourself?"

Greek: 308 ἐρώτα γοῦν καὶ ἀποκρινοῦμαι.
English: "Oh! Ask me a question and judge from my answer."

Greek: 309 ἄλλοθι δὲ οὐδαμοῦ οὐδὲν οἴει φρόνιμον εἶναι;
English: "And do you suppose that wisdom is nowhere else to be found,

Greek: 310 καὶ ταῦτ’ εἰδὼς ὅτι γῆς τε μικρὸν μέρος ἐν τῷ σώματι πολλῆς οὔσης ἔχεις καὶ ὑγροῦ βραχὺ πολλοῦ ὄντος καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δήπου μεγάλων ὄντων ἑκάστου μικρὸν μέρος λαβόντι τὸ σῶμα συνήρμοσταί σοι;
English:  although you know that you have a mere speck of all the earth in your body and a mere drop of all the water, and that of all the other mighty elements you received, I suppose, just a scrap towards the fashioning of your body?"


Greek: 311 νοῦν δὲ μόνον ἄρα οὐδαμοῦ ὄντα σε εὐτυχῶς πως δοκεῖς συναρπάσαι, καὶ τάδε τὰ ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ πλῆθος ἄπειρα δι’ ἀφροσύνην τινά, ὡς οἴει, εὐτάκτως ἔχειν;
English: "But as for mind, which alone, it seems, is without mass, do you think that you snapped it up by a lucky accident, and that the orderly ranks of all these huge masses, infinite in number, are due, forsooth, to a sort of absurdity?"


Greek: 312 μὰ Δί’ οὐ γὰρ ὁρῶ τοὺς κυρίους, ὥσπερ τῶν ἐνθάδε γιγνομένων τοὺς δημιουργούς.
English: "Yes; for I don’t see the master hand, whereas I see the makers of things in this world."


Greek: 313 οὐδὲ γὰρ τὴν σαυτοῦ σύγε ψυχὴν ὁρᾷς, ἣ τοῦ σώματος κυρία ἐστίν;
English: "Neither do you see your own soul, which has the mastery of the body; 

Greek: 314 ὥστε κατά γε τοῦτο ἔξεστί σοι λέγειν, ὅτι οὐδὲν γνώμῃ, ἀλλὰ τύχῃ πάντα πράττεις.
English: so that, as far as that goes, you may say that you do nothing by design, but everything by chance." 

Greek: 315 καὶ ὁ Ἀριστόδημος, οὔτοι, ἔφη, ἐγώ, ὦ Σώκρατες, ὑπερορῶ τὸ δαιμόνιον, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνο μεγαλοπρεπέστερον ἡγοῦμαι ἢ ὡς τῆς ἐμῆς θεραπείας προσδεῖσθαι.
English: Here Aristodemus exclaimed: "Really, Socrates, I don’t despise the godhead. But I think it is too great to need my service." 

Greek: 316 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, ὅσῳ μεγαλοπρεπέστερον ὂν ἀξιοῖ σε θεραπεύειν, τοσούτῳ μᾶλλον τιμητέον αὐτό.
English: "So, the greater the power that deigns to serve you, the more honor it demands of you," Socrates replied.

Continuing from Greek sentence 317:

Greek: 317 εὖ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὅτι , εἰ νομίζοιμι θεοὺς ἀνθρώπων τι φροντίζειν , οὐκ ἂν ἀμελοίην αὐτῶν .
English: "Rest assured," he said, "if I thought that the gods took any care of men, I would not neglect them."

Greek: 318 ἔπειτ’ οὐκ οἴει φροντίζειν ;
English: "Then do you think they do not care?"

Greek: 319 οἳ πρῶτον μὲν μόνον τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον ὀρθὸν ἀνέστησαν ·
English: "They, who of all creatures made only man stand upright."

Greek: 320 ἡ δὲ ὀρθότης καὶ προορᾶν πλέον ποιεῖ δύνασθαι καὶ τὰ ὕπερθεν μᾶλλον θεᾶσθαι καὶ ἧττον κακοπαθεῖν καὶ ὄψιν καὶ ἀκοὴν καὶ στόμα ἐνεποίησαν ·
English: "This erect posture enables him to see farther, to observe things above, and lessens his suffering; and for him they created vision, hearing, and speech."

Greek: 321 ἔπειτα τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἑρπετοῖς πόδας ἔδωκαν , οἳ τὸ πορεύεσθαι μόνον παρέχουσιν , ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ καὶ χεῖρας προσέθεσαν , αἳ τὰ πλεῖστα οἷς εὐδαιμονέστεροι ἐκείνων ἐσμὲν ἐξεργάζονται .
English: "Then, to other creeping creatures they gave feet, which only enable movement, but to man they added hands, which are instruments for our greater happiness."

Greek: 322 καὶ μὴν γλῶττάν γε πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἐχόντων , μόνην τὴν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐποίησαν οἵαν ἄλλοτε ἀλλαχῇ ψαύουσαν τοῦ στόματος ἀρθροῦν τε τὴν φωνὴν καὶ σημαίνειν πάντα ἀλλήλοις ἃ βουλόμεθα .
English: "And though all animals have a tongue, only man's tongue has the ability to articulate speech and express all our desires to each other."

Greek: 323 τὸ δὲ καὶ τὰς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἡδονὰς τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ζῴοις δοῦναι περιγράψαντας τοῦ ἔτους χρόνον , ἡμῖν δὲ συνεχῶς μέχρι γήρως ταῦτα παρέχειν .
English: "Furthermore, while limiting sexual pleasures to a certain season for other animals, for humans they provided it continuously up to old age."

Greek: 324 οὐ τοίνυν μόνον ἤρκεσε τῷ θεῷ τοῦ σώματος ἐπιμεληθῆναι , ἀλλ’ , ὅπερ μέγιστόν ἐστι , καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν κρατίστην τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐνέφυσε .
English: "So it was not enough for the deity to care for the body; he also imparted to man the noblest soul, which is of utmost importance."

Greek: 325 τίνος γὰρ ἄλλου ζῴου ψυχὴ πρῶτα μὲν θεῶν τῶν τὰ μέγιστα καὶ κάλλιστα συνταξάντων ᾔσθηται ὅτι εἰσί ;
English: "For what other animal's soul is aware, first and foremost, of the gods who have ordained the greatest and fairest things?"

Greek: 326 τί δὲ φῦλον ἄλλο ἢ ἄνθρωποι θεοὺς θεραπεύουσι ;
English: "And what race other than humans worships the gods?"

Greek: 327 ποία δὲ ψυχὴ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἱκανωτέρα προφυλάττεσθαι ἢ λιμὸν ἢ δίψος ἢ ψύχη ἢ θάλπη , ἢ νόσοις ἐπικουρῆσαι , ἢ ῥώμην ἀσκῆσαι , ἢ πρὸς μάθησιν ἐκπονῆσαι , ἢ ὅσα ἂν ἀκούσῃ ἢ ἴδῃ ἢ μάθῃ ἱκανωτέρα ἐστὶ διαμεμνῆσθαι ;
English: "And which soul, other than the human soul, is more capable of guarding against hunger, thirst, cold, heat, to heal sickness, to develop strength, to toil for learning, and to remember accurately all that it hears, sees, or learns?"

Continuing from Greek sentence 317:

Greek: 317 εὖ ἴσθι, ἔφη, ὅτι, εἰ νομίζοιμι θεοὺς ἀνθρώπων τι φροντίζειν, οὐκ ἂν ἀμελοίην αὐτῶν.
English: "Rest assured," he said, "if I thought that the gods took any care of men, I would not neglect them."

Greek: 318 ἔπειτ’ οὐκ οἴει φροντίζειν;
English: "Then do you think they do not care?"

Greek: 319 οἳ πρῶτον μὲν μόνον τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον ὀρθὸν ἀνέστησαν;
English: "They, who of all creatures made only man stand upright."

Greek: 320 ἡ δὲ ὀρθότης καὶ προορᾶν πλέον ποιεῖ δύνασθαι καὶ τὰ ὕπερθεν μᾶλλον θεᾶσθαι καὶ ἧττον κακοπαθεῖν καὶ ὄψιν καὶ ἀκοὴν καὶ στόμα ἐνεποίησαν;
English: "This upright posture enables him to see farther, to observe things above, and lessens his suffering; and for him they created vision, hearing, and speech."

Greek: 321 ἔπειτα τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἑρπετοῖς πόδας ἔδωκαν, οἳ τὸ πορεύεσθαι μόνον παρέχουσιν, ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ καὶ χεῖρας προσέθεσαν, αἳ τὰ πλεῖστα οἷς εὐδαιμονέστεροι ἐκείνων ἐσμὲν ἐξεργάζονται.
English: "Then, to other creeping creatures they gave feet, which only enable movement, but to man they added hands, which are instruments for our greater happiness."

Greek: 322 καὶ μὴν γλῶττάν γε πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἐχόντων, μόνην τὴν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐποίησαν οἵαν ἄλλοτε ἀλλαχῇ ψαύουσαν τοῦ στόματος ἀρθροῦν τε τὴν φωνὴν καὶ σημαίνειν πάντα ἀλλήλοις ἃ βουλόμεθα.
English: "And though all animals have a tongue, the tongue of man alone has been formed by them to be capable of contact with different parts of the mouth, so as to enable us to articulate the voice and express all our wants to one another."

Greek: 323 τὸ δὲ καὶ τὰς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἡδονὰς τοῖς μὲν

 ἄλλοις ζῴοις δοῦναι περιγράψαντας τοῦ ἔτους χρόνον, ἡμῖν δὲ συνεχῶς μέχρι γήρως ταῦτα παρέχειν.
English: "Furthermore, while limiting sexual pleasures to a certain season for other animals, for humans they provided it continuously up to old age."

Greek: 324 οὐ τοίνυν μόνον ἤρκεσε τῷ θεῷ τοῦ σώματος ἐπιμεληθῆναι, ἀλλ’, ὅπερ μέγιστόν ἐστι, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν κρατίστην τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐνέφυσε.
English: "So it was not enough for the deity to care for the body; he also imparted to man the noblest soul, which is of utmost importance."

Greek: 325 τίνος γὰρ ἄλλου ζῴου ψυχὴ πρῶτα μὲν θεῶν τῶν τὰ μέγιστα καὶ κάλλιστα συνταξάντων ᾔσθηται ὅτι εἰσί;
English: "For what other animal's soul is aware, first and foremost, of the gods who have ordained the greatest and fairest things?"

Greek: 326 τί δὲ φῦλον ἄλλο ἢ ἄνθρωποι θεοὺς θεραπεύουσι;
English: "And what race other than humans worships the gods?"

Greek: 327 ποία δὲ ψυχὴ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἱκανωτέρα προφυλάττεσθαι ἢ λιμὸν ἢ δίψος ἢ ψύχη ἢ θάλπη, ἢ νόσοις ἐπικουρῆσαι, ἢ ῥώμην ἀσκῆσαι, ἢ πρὸς μάθησιν ἐκπονῆσαι, ἢ ὅσα ἂν ἀκούσῃ ἢ ἴδῃ ἢ μάθῃ ἱκανωτέρα ἐστὶ διαμεμνῆσθαι;
English: "And which soul, other than the human soul, is more capable of guarding against hunger, thirst, cold, heat, to heal sickness, to develop strength, to toil for learning, and to remember accurately all that it hears, sees, or learns?"

Greek: 328 οὐ γὰρ πάνυ σοι κατάδηλον ὅτι παρὰ τ- ἄλλα ζῷα ὥσπερ θεοὶ ἄνθρωποι βιοτεύουσι, φύσει καὶ τῷ σώματι καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ κρατιστεύοντες;
English: "Is it not quite clear to you that compared to other animals, humans live as if they were gods, surpassing in nature, body, and soul?"

Greek: 329 οὔτε γὰρ βοὸς ἂν ἔχων σῶμα, ἀνθρώπου δὲ γνώμην ἐδύνατ’ ἂν πράττειν ἃ ἐβούλετο, οὔθ’ ὅσα χεῖρας ἔχει, ἄφρονα δ’ ἐστί, πλέον οὐδὲν ἔχει.
English: "For neither could a creature with an ox's body and a man's intellect carry out his desires, nor one with hands but without reason achieve more."

Greek: 330 σὺ δ’ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν πλείστου ἀξίων τετυχηκὼς οὐκ οἴει σοῦ θεοὺς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι;
English: "Do you, having received the two most valuable gifts, not think that the gods take care of you?"

Greek: 331 ἀλλ’ ὅταν τί ποιήσωσι, νομιεῖς αὐτοὺς σοῦ φροντίζειν;
English: "But when they do something, do you think they care for you?"

Greek: 332 ὅταν πέμπωσιν, ὥσπερ σὺ φὴς πέμπειν αὐτούς, συμβούλους ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν καὶ μὴ ποιεῖν.
English: "When they send, as you claim they do, counsellors to advise what to do and what not to do."

Greek: 333 ὅταν δὲ Ἀθηναίοις, ἔφη, πυνθανομένοις τι διὰ μαντικῆς φράζωσιν, οὐ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖς φράζειν αὐτούς, οὐδ’ ὅταν τοῖς Ἕλλησι τέρατα πέμποντες προσημαίνωσιν, οὐδ’ ὅταν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ μόνον σὲ ἐξαιροῦντες ἐν ἀμελείᾳ κατατίθενται;
English: "And when the Athenians, through divination, seek guidance and they provide answers, do you not think they also guide you? Or when they send omens to the Greeks or to all mankind? Do you think they neglect everyone but you?"

Continuing from Greek sentence 334:

Greek: 334 οἴει δ’ ἂν τοὺς θεοὺς τοῖς ἀνθρώποις δόξαν ἐμφῦσαι ὡς ἱκανοί εἰσιν εὖ καὶ κακῶς ποιεῖν, εἰ μὴ δυνατοὶ ἦσαν, καὶ ἀνθρώπους ἐξαπατωμένους τὸν πάντα χρόνον οὐδέποτ’ ἂν αἰσθέσθαι;
English: "Do you really think the gods would instill in humans the belief that they have the power to do good or harm if they weren't capable of it, and that humans would be deceived all this time without ever realizing it?"

Greek: 335 οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι τὰ πολυχρονιώτατα καὶ σοφώτατα τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων, πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη, θεοσεβέστατά ἐστι, καὶ αἱ φρονιμώταται ἡλικίαι θεῶν ἐπιμελέσταται;
English: "Don't you see that the most enduring and wisest of human institutions, such as cities and nations, are the most devout in worshipping gods, and the most sensible people are the most attentive to the gods?"

Greek: 336 ὠγαθέ, ἔφη, κατάμαθε ὅτι καὶ ὁ σὸς νοῦς ἐνὼν τὸ σὸν σῶμα ὅπως βούλεται μεταχειρίζεται.
English: "O good man, understand that just as your mind, residing within your body, uses it as it wishes, so it is with these things."

Greek: 337 οἴεσθαι οὖν χρὴ καὶ τὴν ἐν τῷ παντὶ φρόνησιν τὰ πάντα, ὅπως ἂν αὐτῇ ἡδὺ ᾖ, οὕτω τίθεσθαι, καὶ μὴ τὸ σὸν μὲν ὄμμα δύνασθαι ἐπὶ πολλὰ στάδια ἐξικνεῖσθαι, τὸν δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ ὀφθαλμὸν ἀδύνατον εἶναι ἅμα πάντα ὁρᾶν, μηδὲ τὴν σὴν μὲν ψυχὴν καὶ περὶ τῶν ἐνθάδε καὶ περὶ τῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν Σικελίᾳ δύνασθαι φροντίζειν, τὴν δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ φρόνησιν μὴ ἱκανὴν εἶναι ἅμα πάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι.
English: "So, do you believe that the wisdom within the universe arranges all things as it pleases, and that while your own eye can reach over many miles, God's eye cannot see everything at once? And that your own soul can concern itself with things here and in Egypt and Sicily, but the wisdom of God is not capable of caring for everything simultaneously?"


Greek: 338 ἂν μέντοι, ὥσπερ ἀνθρώπους θεραπεύων γιγνώσκεις τοὺς ἀντιθεραπεύειν ἐθέλοντας καὶ χαριζόμενος τοὺς ἀντιχαριζομένους καὶ συμβουλευόμενος καταμανθάνεις τοὺς φρονίμους, οὕτω καὶ τῶν θεῶν πεῖραν λαμβάνῃς θεραπεύων, εἴ τί σοι θελήσουσι περὶ τῶν ἀδήλων ἀνθρώποις συμβουλεύειν, γνώσει τὸ θεῖον ὅτι τοσοῦτον καὶ τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν ὥσθ’ ἅμα πάντα ὁρᾶν καὶ πάντα ἀκούειν καὶ πανταχοῦ παρεῖναι καὶ ἅμα πάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι αὐτούς.
English: Similarly, just as you recognize those who reciprocate your service, show kindness to those who are kind to you, and discern the wise by seeking their counsel, try serving the gods and observe whether they offer you guidance in matters hidden from humans. Then you will understand the divine nature, so great and such that it can see and hear all things, be everywhere at once, and be mindful of everything.

Greek: 339 ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ταῦτα λέγων οὐ μόνον τοὺς συνόντας ἐδόκει ποιεῖν ὁπότε ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὁρῷντο, ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν ἀνοσίων τε καὶ ἀδίκων καὶ αἰσχρῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὁπότε ἐν ἐρημίᾳ εἶεν, ἐπείπερ ἡγήσαιντο μηδὲν ἄν ποτε ὧν πράττοιεν θεοὺς διαλαθεῖν.
English: In saying these things, he not only encouraged those present to abstain from impious, unjust, and shameful actions when observed by others, but even when alone, as they were convinced that nothing they did could ever escape the notice of the gods.

Greek: 340 εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ ἐγκράτεια καλόν τε κ- ἀγαθὸν ἀνδρὶ κτῆμά ἐστιν, ἐπισκεψώμεθα εἴ τι προυβίβαζε λέγων εἰς ταύτην τοιάδε; ὦ ἄνδρες, εἰ πολέμου ἡμῖν γενομένου βουλοίμεθα ἑλέσθαι ἄνδρα, ὑφ’ οὗ μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ μὲν σῳζοίμεθα, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους χειροίμεθα, ἆρ’ ὅντινα ἂν αἰσθανοίμεθα ἥττω γαστρὸς ἢ οἴνου ἢ ἀφροδισίων ἢ πόνου ἢ ὕπνου, τοῦτον ἂν αἱροίμεθα; καὶ πῶς ἂν οἰηθείημεν τὸν τοιοῦτον ἢ ἡμᾶς σῶσαι ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους κρατῆσαι;
English: If self-control is indeed a valuable and noble possession for a man, let us consider if he led them toward this virtue with words like these: 'Men, if in a war we needed to choose a leader under whom we could be saved and conquer our enemies, would we select someone who is less dominated by hunger, wine, lust, toil, or sleep? How could we then expect such a person to save us or defeat our enemies?'

Greek: 341 ὦ ἄνδρες, εἰ πολέμου ἡμῖν γενομένου βουλοίμεθα ἑλέσθαι ἄνδρα, ὑφ’ οὗ μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ μὲν σῳζοίμεθα, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους χειροίμεθα, ἆρ’ ὅντινα ἂν αἰσθανοίμεθα ἥττω γαστρὸς ἢ οἴνου ἢ ἀφροδισίων ἢ πόνου ἢ ὕπνου, τοῦτον ἂν αἱροίμεθα;

English: 
My friends, if we were at war and wanted to choose a leader most capable of helping us to save ourselves and conquer the enemy, should we choose one whom we knew to be the slave of the belly, or of wine, or lust, or sleep? How could we expect that such an one would either save us or defeat the enemy?

Greek: 342 καὶ πῶς ἂν οἰηθείημεν τὸν τοιοῦτον ἢ ἡμᾶς σῶσαι ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους κρατῆσαι;

English: 
How could we expect that such an one would either save us or defeat the enemy?

Greek: 343 εἰ δ’ ἐπὶ τελευτῇ τοῦ βίου γενόμενοι βουλοίμεθά τῳ ἐπιτρέψαι ἢ παῖδας ἄρρενας παιδεῦσαι ἢ θυγατέρας παρθένους διαφυλάξαι ἢ χρήματα διασῶσαι, ἆρ’ ἀξιόπιστον εἰς ταῦθ’ ἡγησόμεθα τὸν ἀκρατῆ;

English: 
Or if at the end of our life we should wish to appoint a guardian to educate our boys or protect our girls or to take care of our goods, should we think a loose liver a trustworthy man to choose?

Greek: 344 δούλῳ δ’ ἀκρατεῖ ἐπιτρέψαιμεν ἂν ἢ βοσκήματα ἢ ταμιεῖα ἢ ἔργων ἐπιστασίαν;

English: 
Should we entrust live stock or storehouses or the management of works to a vicious slave?

Greek: 345 διάκονον δὲ καὶ ἀγοραστὴν τοιοῦτον ἐθελήσαιμεν ἂν προῖκα λαβεῖν;

English: 
Should we be willing to take as a gift a page or an errandboy with such a character?

Greek: 346 ἀλλὰ μὴν εἴ γε μηδὲ δοῦλον ἀκρατῆ δεξαίμεθ’ ἄν, πῶς οὐκ ἄξιον αὐτόν γε φυλάξασθαι τοιοῦτον γενέσθαι;

English: 
Surely then, if we should refuse a vicious slave, the master must look to it that he does not grow vicious himself?

Greek: 347 καὶ γὰρ οὐχ ὥσπερ οἱ πλεονέκται τῶν ἄλλων ἀφαιρούμενοι χρήματα ἑαυτοὺς δοκοῦσι πλουτίζειν, οὕτως ὁ ἀκρατὴς τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις βλαβερός, ἑαυτῷ δ’ ὠφέλιμος, ἀλλὰ κακοῦργος μὲν τῶν ἄλλων, ἑαυτοῦ δὲ πολὺ κακουργότερος, εἴ γε κακουργότατόν ἐστι μὴ μόνον τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἑαυτοῦ φθείρειν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὴν ψυχήν;

English: 
For whereas the covetous, by robbing other men of their goods, seem to enrich themselves, a vicious man reaps no advantage from the harm he does to others. If he is a worker of mischief to others, he brings much greater mischief on himself, if indeed the greatest mischief of all is to ruin not one’s home merely, but the body and the soul.

Greek: 348 ἐν συνουσίᾳ δὲ τίς ἂν ἡσθείη τῷ τοιούτῳ, ὃν εἰδείη τῷ ὄψῳ τε καὶ τῷ οἴνῳ χαίροντα μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς φίλοις καὶ τὰς πόρνας ἀγαπῶντα μᾶλλον ἢ τοὺς ἑταίρους;

English: 
In social intercourse what pleasure could you find in such a man, knowing that he prefers your sauces and your wines to your friends, and likes the women better than the company?

Greek: 349 ἆρά γε οὐ χρὴ πάντα ἄνδρα, ἡγησάμενον τὴν ἐγκράτειαν ἀρετῆς εἶναι κρηπῖδα, ταύτην πρῶτον ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ κατασκευάσασθαι;

English: 
Should not every man hold self-control to be the foundation of all virtue, and first lay this foundation firmly in his soul?

Greek: 350 τίς γὰρ ἄνευ ταύτης ἢ μάθοι τι ἂν ἀγαθὸν ἢ μελετήσειεν ἀξιολόγως;

English: 
For who without this can learn any good or practise it worthily?

Greek: 351 ἢ τίς οὐκ ἂν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς δουλεύων αἰσχρῶς διατεθείη καὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὴν ψυχήν;

English: 
Or what man that is the slave of his pleasures is not in an evil plight body and soul alike?

Greek: 352 ἐμοὶ μὲν δοκεῖ νὴ τὴν Ἥραν ἐλευθέρῳ μὲν ἀνδρὶ εὐκτὸν εἶναι μὴ τυχεῖν δούλου τοιούτου, δουλεύοντα δὲ ταῖς τοιαύταις ἡδοναῖς ἱκετευτέον τοὺς θεοὺς δεσποτῶν ἀγαθῶν τυχεῖν;

English: 
From my heart I declare that every free man should pray not to have such a man among his slaves; and every man who is a slave to such pleasures should entreat the gods to give him good masters: thus, and only thus, may he find salvation.

Greek: 353 οὕτω γὰρ ἂν μόνως ὁ τοιοῦτος σωθείη.

English: 
Thus, and only thus, may he find salvation.

Greek: 354 τοιαῦτα δὲ λέγων ἔτι ἐγκρατέστερον τοῖς ἔργοις ἢ τοῖς λόγοις ἑαυτὸν ἐπεδείκνυεν ·
English: Such were his words; but his own self-control was shown yet more clearly by his deeds than by his words.

Greek: 355 οὐ γὰρ μόνον τῶν διὰ τοῦ σώματος ἡδονῶν ἐκράτει, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς διὰ τῶν χρημάτων, νομίζων τὸν παρὰ τοῦ τυχόντος χρήματα λαμβάνοντα δεσπότην ἑαυτοῦ καθιστάναι καὶ δουλεύειν δουλείαν οὐδεμιᾶς ἧττον αἰσχράν.
English: For he kept in subjection not only the pleasures of the body, but those too that money brings, in the belief that he who takes money from any casual giver puts himself under a master and endures the basest form of slavery.

Greek: 356 ἄξιον δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἃ πρὸς Ἀντιφῶντα τὸν σοφιστὴν διελέχθη μὴ παραλιπεῖν.
English: It is due to him that a conversation he had with Antiphon the Sophist should not go unrecorded.

Greek: 357 ὁ γὰρ Ἀντιφῶν ποτε βουλόμενος τοὺς συνουσιαστὰς αὐτοῦ παρελέσθαι προσελθὼν τῷ Σωκράτει παρόντων αὐτῶν ἔλεξε τάδε ·
English: Antiphon came to Socrates with the intention of drawing his companions away from him, and spoke thus in their presence:

Greek: 358 ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐγὼ μὲν ᾤμην τοὺς φιλοσοφοῦντας εὐδαιμονεστέρους χρῆναι γίγνεσθαι ·
English: “Socrates, I supposed that philosophy must add to one’s store of happiness.

Greek: 359 σὺ δέ μοι δοκεῖς τ- ἐναντία τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἀπολελαυκέναι.
English: But the fruits you have reaped from philosophy are apparently very different.

Greek: 360 ζῇς γοῦν οὕτως ὡς οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς δοῦλος ὑπὸ δεσπότῃ διαιτώμενος μείνειε ·
English: For example, you are living a life that would drive even a slave to desert his master.

Greek: 361 σῖτά τε σιτῇ καὶ ποτὰ πίνεις τὰ φαυλότατα, καὶ ἱμάτιον ἠμφίεσαι οὐ μόνον φαῦλον, ἀλλὰ τὸ αὐτὸ θέρους τε καὶ χειμῶνος, ἀνυπόδητός τε καὶ ἀχίτων διατελεῖς.
English: Your meat and drink are of the poorest: the cloak you wear is not only a poor thing, but is never changed summer or winter; and you never wear shoes or tunic.

Greek: 362 καὶ μὴν χρήματά γε οὐ λαμβάνεις, ἃ καὶ κτωμένους εὐφραίνει καὶ κεκτημένους ἐλευθεριώτερόν τε καὶ ἥδιον ποιεῖ ζῆν.
English: Besides you refuse to take money, the mere getting of which is a joy, while its possession makes one more independent and happier.

Greek: 363 εἰ οὖν ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἔργων οἱ διδάσκαλοι τοὺς μαθητὰς μιμητὰς ἑαυτῶν ἀποδεικνύουσιν, οὕτω καὶ σὺ τοὺς συνόντας διαθήσεις, νόμιζε κακοδαιμονίας διδάσκαλος εἶναι.
English: Now the professors of other subjects try to make their pupils copy their teachers: if you too intend to make your companions do that, you must consider yourself a professor of unhappiness.”

Greek: 364 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπε ·

English: To this Socrates replied:

Greek: 365 δοκεῖς μοι, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, ὑπειληφέναι με οὕτως ἀνιαρῶς ζῆν, ὥστε πέπεισμαι σὲ μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἂν ἑλέσθαι ἢ ζῆν ὥσπερ ἐγώ.

English: "Antiphon, you seem to have a notion that my life is so miserable, that I feel sure you would choose death in preference to a life like mine."

Greek: 366 ἴθι οὖν ἐπισκεψώμεθα τί χαλεπὸν ᾔσθησαι τοῦ ἐμοῦ βίου.

English: "Come then, let us consider together what hardship you have noticed in my life."

Greek: 367 πότερον ὅτι τοῖς μὲν λαμβάνουσιν ἀργύριον ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστιν ἀπεργάζεσθαι τοῦτο ἐφ’ ᾧ ἂν μισθὸν λάβωσιν, ἐμοὶ δὲ μὴ λαμβάνοντι οὐκ ἀνάγκη διαλέγεσθαι ᾧ ἂν μὴ βούλωμαι;

English: "Is it that those who take money are bound to carry out the work for which they get a fee, while I, because I refuse to take it, am not obliged to talk with anyone against my will?"

Greek: 368 ἢ τὴν δίαιτάν μου φαυλίζεις ὡς ἧττον μὲν ὑγιεινὰ ἐσθίοντος ἐμοῦ ἢ σοῦ, ἧττον δὲ ἰσχὺν παρέχοντα;

English: "Or do you think my food poor because it is less wholesome than yours or less nourishing?"

Greek: 369 ἢ ὡς χαλεπώτερα πορίσασθαι τὰ ἐμὰ διαιτήματα τῶν σῶν διὰ τὸ σπανιώτερά τε καὶ πολυτελέστερα εἶναι;

English: "Or because my viands are harder to get than yours, being scarcer and more expensive?"

Greek: 370 ἢ ὡς ἡδίω σοι ἃ σὺ παρασκευάζῃ ὄντα ἢ ἐμοὶ ἃ ἐγώ;

English: "Or because your diet is more enjoyable than mine?"

Greek: 371 οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι ὁ μὲν ἥδιστα ἐσθίων ἥκιστα ὄψου δεῖται, ὁ δὲ ἥδιστα πίνων ἥκιστα τοῦ μὴ παρόντος ἐπιθυμεῖ ποτοῦ;

English: "Do you not know that the greater the enjoyment of eating the less the need of sauce; the greater the enjoyment of drinking, the less the desire for drinks that are not available?"

Greek: 372 τά γε μὴν ἱμάτια οἶσθ’ ὅτι οἱ μεταβαλλόμενοι ψύχους καὶ θάλπους ἕνεκα μεταβάλλονται, καὶ ὑποδήματα ὑποδοῦνται, ὅπως μὴ διὰ τὰ λυποῦντα τοὺς πόδας κωλύωνται πορεύεσθαι;

English: "As for cloaks, they are changed, as you know, on account of cold or heat. And shoes are worn as a protection to the feet against pain and inconvenience in walking."

Greek: 373 ἤδη οὖν ποτε ᾔσθου ἐμὲ ἢ διὰ ψῦχος μᾶλλόν του ἔνδον μένοντα, ἢ διὰ θάλπος μαχόμενόν τῳ περὶ σκιᾶς, ἢ διὰ τὸ ἀλγεῖν τοὺς πόδας οὐ βαδίζοντα ὅπου ἂν βούλωμαι;

English: "Now did you ever know me to stay indoors more than others on account of the cold, or to fight with any man for the shade because of the heat, or to be prevented from walking anywhere by sore feet?"

Greek: 374 οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι οἱ φύσει ἀσθενέστατοι τῷ σώματι μελετήσαντες τῶν ἰσχυροτάτων ἀμελησάντων κρείττους τε γίγνονται πρὸς ἃ ἂν μελετῶσι καὶ ῥᾷον αὐτὰ φέρουσιν;

English: "Do you not know that by training, a puny weakling comes to be better at any form of exercise he practises, and gets more staying power, than the muscular prodigy who neglects to train?"

Greek: 375 ἐμὲ δὲ ἄρα οὐκ οἴει, τῷ σώματι ἀεὶ τὰ συντυγχάνοντα μελετῶντα καρτερεῖν, πάντα ῥᾷον φέρειν σοῦ μὴ μελετῶντος;

English: "Seeing then that I am always training my body to answer any and every call on its powers, do you not think that I can stand every strain better than you can without training?"

Greek: 376 τοῦ δὲ μὴ δουλεύειν γαστρὶ μηδ’ ὕπνῳ καὶ λαγνείᾳ οἴει τι ἄλλο αἰτιώτερον εἶναι ἢ τὸ ἕτερα ἔχειν τούτων ἡδίω, ἃ οὐ μόνον ἐν χρείᾳ ὄντα εὐφραίνει, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐλπίδας παρέχοντα ὠφελήσειν ἀεί;

English: "For avoiding slavery to the belly or to sleep and incontinence, is there, think you, any more effective specific than the possession of other and greater pleasures, which are delightful not only to enjoy, but also because they arouse hopes of lasting benefit?"

Greek: 377 καὶ μὴν τοῦτό γε οἶσθα, ὅτι οἱ μὲν οἰόμενοι μηδὲν εὖ πράττειν οὐκ εὐφραίνονται, οἱ δὲ ἡγούμενοι καλῶς προχωρεῖν ἑαυτοῖς ἢ γεωργίαν ἢ ναυκληρίαν ἢ ἄλλ’ ὅ τι ἂν τυγχάνωσιν ἐργαζόμενοι ὡς εὖ πράττοντες εὐφραίνονται.

English: "And again, you surely know that while he who supposes that nothing goes well with him is unhappy, he who believes that he is successful in farming or a shipping concern or any other business he is engaged in is happy in the thought of his prosperity."

Greek: 378 οἴει οὖν ἀπὸ πάντων τούτων τοσαύτην ἡδονὴν εἶναι ὅσην ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑαυτόν τε ἡγεῖσθαι βελτίω γίγνεσθαι καὶ φίλους ἀμείνους κτᾶσθαι;

English: "Do you think then that out of all this thinking there comes anything so pleasant as the thought: 'I am growing in goodness and I am making better friends?'"

Greek: 379 ἐγὼ τοίνυν διατελῶ ταῦτα νομίζων.

English: "And that, I may say, is my constant thought."

Greek: 380 ἐὰν δὲ δὴ φίλους ἢ πόλιν ὠφελεῖν δέῃ, ποτέρῳ ἡ πλείων σχολὴ τούτων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι, τῷ ὡς ἐγὼ νῦν ἢ τῷ ὡς σὺ μακαρίζεις διαιτωμένῳ;

English: "Further, if help is wanted by friends or city, which of the two has more leisure to supply their needs, he who lives as I am living or he whose life you call happy?"

Greek: 381 στρατεύοιτο δὲ πότερος ἂν ῥᾷον, ὁ μὴ δυνάμενος ἄνευ πολυτελοῦς διαίτης ζῆν ἢ ᾧ τὸ παρὸν ἀρκοίη;

English: "Which will find soldiering the easier task, he who cannot exist without expensive food or he who is content with what he can get?"

Greek: 382 ἐκπολιορκηθείη δὲ πότερος ἂν θᾶττον, ὁ τῶν χαλεπωτάτων εὑρεῖν δεόμενος ἢ ὁ τοῖς ῥᾴστοις ἐντυγχάνειν ἀρκούντως χρώμενος;

English: "Which when besieged will surrender first, he who wants what is very hard to come by or he who can make shift with whatever is at hand?"

Greek: 383 ἔοικας, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν οἰομένῳ τρυφὴν καὶ πολυτέλειαν εἶναι· ἐγὼ δὲ νομίζω τὸ μὲν μηδενὸς δεῖσθαι θεῖον εἶναι, τὸ δ' ὡς ἐλαχίστων ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου, καὶ τὸ μὲν θεῖον κράτιστον, τὸ δ' ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ κρατίστου.


Greek: 384 Εγὼ δὲ νομίζω τὸ μὲν μηδενὸς δεῖσθαι θεῖον εἶναι, τὸ δ' ὡς ἐλαχίστων ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου, καὶ τὸ μὲν θεῖον κράτιστον, τὸ δ' ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ κρατίστου.

English: "You seem, Antiphon, to imagine that happiness consists in luxury and extravagance. But my belief is that to have no wants is divine; to have as few as possible comes next to the divine; and as that which is divine is supreme, so that which approaches nearest to its nature is nearest to the supreme."

Greek: 385 πάλιν δέ ποτε ὁ Ἀντιφῶν διαλεγόμενος τῷ Σωκράτει εἶπεν·

English: "In another conversation with Socrates, Antiphon said:"

Greek: 386 ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐγώ τοί σε δίκαιον μὲν νομίζω, σοφὸν δὲ οὐδ' ὁπωστιοῦν·

English: "Socrates, I for my part believe you to be a just, but by no means a wise man."

Greek: 387 δοκεῖς δέ μοι καὶ αὐτὸς τοῦτο γιγνώσκειν·

English: "And I think you realise it yourself."

Greek: 388 οὐδένα γοῦν τῆς συνουσίας ἀργύριον πράττῃ.

English: "Anyhow, you decline to take money for your society."

Greek: 389 καίτοι τό γε ἱμάτιον ἢ τὴν οἰκίαν ἢ ἄλλο τι ὧν κέκτησαι νομίζων ἀργυρίου ἄξιον εἶναι οὐδενὶ ἂν μὴ ὅτι προῖκα δοίης, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἔλαττον τῆς ἀξίας λαβών.

English: "Yet if you believed your cloak or house or anything you possess to be worth money, you would not part with it for nothing or even for less than its value."

Greek: 390 δῆλον δὴ ὅτι εἰ καὶ τὴν συνουσίαν ᾤου τινὸς ἀξίαν εἶναι, καὶ ταύτης ἂν οὐκ ἔλαττον τῆς ἀξίας ἀργύριον ἐπράττου.

English: "Clearly, then, if you set any value on your society, you would insist on getting the proper price for that too."

Greek: 391 δίκαιος μὲν οὖν ἂν εἴης, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξαπατᾷς ἐπὶ πλεονεξίᾳ, σοφὸς δὲ οὐκ ἄν, μηδενός γε ἄξια ἐπιστάμενος.

English: "It may well be that you are a just man because you do not cheat people through avarice; but wise you cannot be, since your knowledge is not worth anything."

392 ὁ δὲ Σωκράτης πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπεν·
To this Socrates replied:

393 ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, παρ’ ἡμῖν νομίζεται τὴν ὥραν καὶ τὴν σοφίαν ὁμοίως μὲν καλόν, ὁμοίως δὲ αἰσχρὸν διατίθεσθαι εἶναι.
"Antiphon, it is common opinion among us in regard to beauty and wisdom that there is an honourable and a shameful way of bestowing them."

394 τήν τε γὰρ ὥραν ἐὰν μέν τις ἀργυρίου πωλῇ τῷ βουλομένῳ, πόρνον αὐτὸν ἀποκαλοῦσιν, ἐὰν δέ τις, ὃν ἂν γνῷ καλόν τε κ- ἀγαθὸν ἐραστὴν ὄντα, τοῦτον φίλον ἑαυτῷ ποιῆται, σώφρονα νομίζομεν·
"For to offer one’s beauty for money to all comers is called prostitution; but we think it virtuous to become friendly with a lover who is known to be a man of honour."

395 καὶ τὴν σοφίαν ὡσαύτως τοὺς μὲν ἀργυρίου τῷ βουλομένῳ πωλοῦντας σοφιστὰς ὥσπερ πόρνους ἀποκαλοῦσιν, ὅστις δὲ ὃν ἂν γνῷ εὐφυᾶ ὄντα διδάσκων ὅ τι ἂν ἔχῃ ἀγαθὸν φίλον ποιεῖται, τοῦτον νομίζομεν, ἃ τῷ καλῷ κ- ἀγαθῷ πολίτῃ προσήκει, ταῦτα ποιεῖν.
"So is it with wisdom. Those who offer it to all comers for money are known as sophists, prostitutors of wisdom, but we think that he who makes a friend of one whom he knows to be gifted by nature, and teaches him all the good he can, fulfils the duty of a citizen and a gentleman."

396 ἐγὼ δ’ οὖν καὶ αὐτός, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, ὥσπερ ἄλλος τις ἢ ἵππῳ ἀγαθῷ ἢ κυνὶ ἢ ὄρνιθι ἥδεται, οὕτω καὶ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἥδομαι φίλοις ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ ἐάν τι ἔχω ἀγαθόν, διδάσκω, καὶ ἄλλοις συνίστημι παρ’ ὧν ἂν ἡγῶμ

αι ὠφελήσεσθαί τι αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀρετήν·
"That is my own view, Antiphon. Others have a fancy for a good horse or dog or bird: my fancy, stronger even than theirs, is for good friends. And I teach them all the good I can, and recommend them to others from whom I think they will get some moral benefit."

397 καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς τῶν πάλαι σοφῶν ἀνδρῶν, οὓς ἐκεῖνοι κατέλιπον ἐν βιβλίοις γράψαντες, ἀνελίττων κοινῇ σὺν τοῖς φίλοις διέρχομαι, καὶ ἄν τι ὁρῶμεν ἀγαθὸν ἐκλεγόμεθα·
"And the treasures that the wise men of old have left us in their writings I open and explore with my friends. If we come on any good thing, we extract it, and we set much store on being useful to one another."

398 καὶ μέγα νομίζομεν κέρδος, ἐὰν ἀλλήλοις φίλοι γιγνώμεθα.
"For my part, when I heard these words fall from his lips, I judged him to be a happy man himself and to be putting his hearers in the way of being gentlemen."

399 ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἀκούοντι ἐδόκει αὐτός τε μακάριος εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντας ἐπὶ καλοκἀγαθίαν ἄγειν.
"And we set much store on being useful to one another."

400 καὶ πάλιν ποτὲ τοῦ Ἀντιφῶντος ἐρομένου αὐτόν, πῶς ἄλλους μὲν ἡγεῖται πολιτικοὺς ποιεῖν, αὐτὸς δ’ οὐ πράττει τὰ πολιτικά, εἴπερ ἐπίσταται·
On yet another occasion Antiphon asked him: "How can you suppose that you make politicians of others, when you yourself avoid politics even if you understand them?"

401 ποτέρως δ’ ἄν, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, μᾶλλον τὰ πολιτικὰ πράττοιμι, εἰ μόνος αὐτὰ πράττοιμι ἢ εἰ ἐπιμελοίμην τοῦ ὡς πλείστους ἱκανοὺς εἶναι πράττειν αὐτά;
"How now, Antiphon?" he retorted, "should I play a more important part in politics by engaging in them alone or by taking pains to turn out as many competent politicians as possible?"

402 ἐπισκεψώμεθα δὲ εἰ καὶ ἀλαζονείας ἀποτρέπων τοὺς συνόντας ἀρετῆς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι προέτρεπεν·
Let us next consider whether by discouraging imposture he encouraged his companions to cultivate virtue.

403 ἀεὶ γὰρ ἔλεγεν ὡς οὐκ εἴη καλλίων ὁδὸς ἐπ’ εὐδοξίαν ἢ δι’ ἧς ἄν τις ἀγαθὸς τοῦτο γένοιτο, ὃ καὶ δοκεῖν βούλοιτο.
For he always said that the best road to glory is the way that makes a man as good as he wishes to be thought.

404 ὅτι δ’ ἀληθῆ ἔλεγεν, ὧδ’ ἐδίδασκεν·
And this was how he demonstrated the truth of this saying:

405 ἐνθυμώμεθα γάρ, ἔφη, εἴ τις μὴ ὢν ἀγαθὸς αὐλητὴς δοκεῖν βούλοιτο, τί ἂν αὐτῷ ποιητέον εἴη.
"Suppose a bad flute-player wants to be thought a good one, let us note what he must do."

406 ἆρ’ οὐ τὰ ἔξω τῆς τέχνης μιμητέον τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς αὐλητάς;
"Must he not imitate good players in the accessories of the art?"

407 καὶ πρῶτον μέν, ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι σκεύη τε καλὰ κέκτηνται καὶ ἀκολούθους πολλοὺς περιάγονται, καὶ τούτῳ ταῦτα ποιητέον·
"First, as they wear fine clothes and travel with many attendants, he must do the same."

408 ἔπειτα, ὅτι ἐκείνους πολλοὶ ἐπαινοῦσι, καὶ τούτῳ πολλοὺς ἐπαινέτας παρασκευαστέον.
"Further, seeing that they win the applause of crowds, he must provide himself with a large claque."

409 ἀλλὰ μὴν ἔργον γε οὐδαμοῦ ληπτέον, ἢ εὐθὺς ἐλεγχθήσεται γελοῖος ὢν καὶ οὐ μόνον αὐλητὴς κακός, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἀλαζών.
"But, of course, he must never accept an engagement, or he will promptly expose himself to ridicule as an incompetent player and an impostor to boot."

410 καίτοι πολλὰ μὲν δαπανῶν, μηδὲν δ’ ὠφελούμενος, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις κακοδοξῶν, πῶς οὐκ ἐπιπόνως τε καὶ ἀλυσιτελῶς καὶ καταγελάστως βιώσεται;
"And so, what with incurring heavy expense and gaining nothing, and bringing disgrace on himself as well, he will make his life burdensome, unprofitable and ridiculous."

411 ὣς δ’ αὔτως εἴ τις βούλοιτο στρατηγὸς ἀγαθὸς μὴ ὢν φαίνεσθαι ἢ κυβερνήτης, ἐννοῶμεν τί ἂν αὐτῷ συμβαίνοι.
"So too if a man who is not a general or a pilot wanted to be thought a good one, let us imagine what would happen to him."

412 ἆρ’ οὐκ ἄν, εἰ μὲν ἐπιθυμῶν τοῦ δοκεῖν ἱκανὸς εἶναι ταῦτα πράττειν μὴ δύναιτο πείθειν, τοῦτ’ εἴη λυπηρόν, εἰ δὲ πείσειεν, ἔτι ἀθλιώτερον;
"If his efforts to seem proficient in these duties failed to carry conviction, would not his failure be galling to him? if they succeeded, would not his success be still more disastrous?"

413 δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι κυβερνᾶν κατασταθεὶς ὁ μὴ ἐπιστάμενος ἢ στρατηγεῖν ἀπολέσειεν ἂν οὓς ἥκιστα βούλοιτο καὶ αὐτὸς αἰσχρῶς ἂν καὶ κακῶς ἀπαλλάξειεν.
"for it is certain that if a man who knew nothing about piloting a ship or commanding an army were appointed to such work, he would lose those whom he least wanted to lose and would bring ruin and disgrace on himself."

414 ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ τὸ πλούσιον καὶ τὸ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν μὴ ὄντα δοκεῖν ἀλυσιτελὲς ἀπέφαινε;
"By similar reasoning he would show how unprofitable is a reputation for wealth or courage or strength when it is undeserved."

415 προστάττεσθαι γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἔφη μείζω ἢ κατὰ δύναμιν, καὶ μὴ δυναμένους ταῦτα ποιεῖν, δοκοῦντας ἱκανοὺς εἶναι, συγγνώμης οὐκ ἂν τυγχάνειν.
"Tasks beyond their powers," he would say, "are laid on the incompetent, and no mercy is shown to them when they disappoint the expectation formed of their capability."

416 ἀπατεῶνα δ’ ἐκάλει οὐ μικρὸν μὲν οὐδ’ εἴ τις ἀργύριον ἢ σκεῦος παρά του πειθοῖ λαβὼν ἀποστεροίη, πολὺ δὲ μέγιστον ὅστις μηδενὸς ἄξιος ὢν ἐξηπατήκοι πείθων ὡς ἱκανὸς εἴη τῆς πόλεως ἡγεῖσθαι.
"The man who persuades you to lend him money or goods and then keeps them is without doubt a rogue; but much the greatest rogue of all is the man who has gulled his city into the belief that he is fit to direct it."

417 ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ἐδόκει καὶ τοῦ ἀλαζονεύεσθαι ἀποτρέπειν τοὺς συνόντας τοιάδε διαλεγόμενος.
"For my part I thought that such talks did discourage imposture among his companions."

418 ἐδόκει δέ μοι καὶ τοιαῦτα λέγων προτρέπειν τοὺς συνόντας ἀσκεῖν ἐγκράτειαν πρὸς ἐπιθυμίαν βρωτοῦ καὶ ποτοῦ καὶ λαγνείας καὶ ὕπνου καὶ ῥίγους καὶ θάλπους καὶ πόνου.
"In other conversations I thought that he exhorted his companions to practise self-control in the matter of eating and drinking, and sexual indulgence, and sleeping, and endurance of cold and heat and toil."

419 γνοὺς γάρ τινα τῶν συνόντων ἀκολαστοτέρως ἔχοντα πρὸς τὰ τοιαῦτα, εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε, εἰ δέοι σε παιδεύειν παραλαβόντα δύο τῶν νέων, τὸν μέν, ὅπως ἱκανὸς ἔσται ἄρχειν, τὸν δ’, ὅπως μηδ’ ἀντιποιήσεται ἀρχῆς, πῶς ἂν ἑκάτερον παιδεύοις;
"Aware that one of his companions was rather intemperate in such matters, he said: 'Tell me, Aristippus, if you were required to take charge of two youths and educate them so that the one would be fit to rule and the other would never think of putting himself forward, how would you educate them? Shall we consider it, beginning with the elementary question of food?'"

420 βούλει σκοπῶμεν ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς τροφῆς ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων;
"Oh yes," replied Aristippus, "food does seem to come first; for one can’t live without food."

421 καὶ ὁ Ἀρίστιππος ἔφη·
Aristippus agreed, saying, "Yes, naturally."

422 δοκεῖ γοῦν μοι ἡ τροφὴ ἀρχὴ εἶναι·
He continued, "Food does seem to come first."

423 οὐδὲ γὰρ ζῴη γ’ ἄν τις, εἰ μὴ τρέφοιτο.
"For one can't live without food."

424 οὐκοῦν τὸ μὲν βούλεσθαι σίτου ἅπτεσθαι, ὅταν ὥρα ἥκῃ, ἀμφοτέροις εἰκὸς παραγίγνεσθαι;
"Well, now, will not a desire for food naturally arise in both at certain times?" 

425 εἰκὸς γάρ, ἔφη.
"Yes, naturally," Aristippus responded.

426 τὸ οὖν προαιρεῖσθαι τὸ κατεπεῖγον μᾶλλον πράττειν ἢ τῇ γαστρὶ

 χαρίζεσθαι πότερον ἂν αὐτῶν ἐθίζοιμεν;
"Now which of the two should we train in the habit of transacting urgent business before he satisfies his hunger?"

427 τὸν εἰς τὸ ἄρχειν, ἔφη, νὴ Δία παιδευόμενον, ὅπως μὴ τὰ τῆς πόλεως ἄπρακτα γίγνηται παρὰ τὴν ἐκείνου ἀρχήν.
"The one who is being trained to rule, undoubtedly; else State business might be neglected during his tenure."

428 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, καὶ ὅταν πιεῖν βούλωνται, τὸ δύνασθαι διψῶντα ἀνέχεσθαι τῷ αὐτῷ προσθετέον;
"And must not the same one be given power to resist thirst when both want to drink?"

429 πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη.
"Certainly," said Aristippus.

430 τὸ δὲ ὕπνου ἐγκρατῆ εἶναι, ὥστε δύνασθαι καὶ ὀψὲ κοιμηθῆναι καὶ πρῲ ἀναστῆναι καὶ ἀγρυπνῆσαι, εἴ τι δέοι, ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθείημεν;
"And to which shall we give the power of limiting his sleep so that he can go late to bed and get up early, and do without sleep if need be?"

431 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ αὐτῷ.
"To the same again," Aristippus agreed.

432 τί δέ, ἔφη, τὸ ἀφροδισίων ἐγκρατῆ εἶναι, ὥστε μὴ διὰ ταῦτα κωλύεσθαι πράττειν, εἴ τι δέοι;
"And the power to control his passions, so that he may not be hindered in doing necessary work?"

433 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ αὐτῷ.
"To the same again," he said.

434 τί δέ, τὸ μὴ φεύγειν τοὺς πόνους, ἀλλ’ ἐθελοντὴν ὑπομένειν ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθείημεν;
"And to which shall we give the habit of not shirking a task, but undertaking it willingly?"

435 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ ἄρχειν παιδευομένῳ.
"That too will go to the one who is being trained to rule," said Aristippus.


436	τί δέ , τὸ μαθεῖν εἴ τι ἐπιτήδειόν ἐστι μάθημα πρὸς τὸ κρατεῖν τῶν ἀντιπάλων , ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθεῖναι μᾶλλον πρέποι ;
"And to which would the knowledge needful for overcoming enemies be more appropriately given?"

437	πολὺ νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , τῷ ἄρχειν παιδευομένῳ ·
"Without doubt to the one who is being trained to rule;

438	καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων οὐδὲν ὄφελος ἄνευ τῶν τοιούτων μαθημάτων .
 for the other lessons would be useless without such knowledge."

439	οὐκοῦν ὁ οὕτω πεπαιδευμένος ἧττον ἂν δοκεῖ σοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀντιπάλων ἢ τὰ λοιπὰ ζῷα ἁλίσκεσθαι ;
"Don’t you think that with this education he will be less likely to be caught by his enemy than other creatures?"

440	τούτων γὰρ δήπου τὰ μὲν γαστρὶ δελεαζόμενα , καὶ μάλα ἔνια δυσωπούμενα , ὅμως τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀγόμενα πρὸς τὸ δέλεαρ ἁλίσκεται , τὰ δὲ ποτῷ ἐνεδρεύεται .
"Some of them, you know, are so greedy, that in spite of extreme timidity in some cases, they are drawn irresistibly to the bait to get food, and are caught; and others are snared by drink."

441	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Yes, certainly."

442	οὐκοῦν καὶ ἄλλα ὑπὸ λαγνείας , οἷον οἵ τε ὄρτυγες καὶ οἱ πέρδικες , πρὸς τὴν τῆς θηλείας φωνὴν τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ καὶ τῇ ἐλπίδι τῶν ἀφροδισίων φερόμενοι καὶ ἐξιστάμενοι τοῦ τὰ δεινὰ ἀναλογίζεσθαι τοῖς θηράτροις ἐμπίπτουσι ;
"Others again — quails and partridges, for instance — are so amorous, that when they hear the cry of the female, they are carried away by desire and anticipation, throw caution to the winds and blunder into the nets. Is it not so?"

443	συνέφη καὶ ταῦτα .
He agreed again.

444	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι

 αἰσχρὸν εἶναι ἀνθρώπῳ τ- αὐτὰ πάσχειν τοῖς ἀφρονεστάτοις τῶν θηρίων ;
"Now, don’t you think it disgraceful that a man should be in the same plight as the silliest of wild creatures?"

445	ὥσπερ οἱ μοιχοὶ εἰσέρχονται εἰς τὰς εἰρκτάς , εἰδότες ὅτι κίνδυνος τῷ μοιχεύοντι ἅ τε ὁ νόμος ἀπειλεῖ παθεῖν καὶ ἐνεδρευθῆναι καὶ ληφθέντα ὑβρισθῆναι ·
"Thus an adulterer enters the women’s quarters, knowing that by committing adultery he is in danger of incurring the penalties threatened by the law, and that he may be trapped, caught and ill-treated."

446	καὶ τηλικούτων μὲν ἐπικειμένων τῷ μοιχεύοντι κακῶν τε καὶ αἰσχρῶν , ὄντων δὲ πολλῶν τῶν ἀπολυσόντων τῆς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἐπιθυμίας ἐν ἀδείᾳ , ὅμως εἰς τὰ ἐπικίνδυνα φέρεσθαι , ἆρ’ οὐκ ἤδη τοῦτο παντάπασι κακοδαιμονῶντός ἐστιν ;
"When such misery and disgrace hang over the adulterer’s head, and there are many remedies to relieve him of his carnal desire without risk, is it not sheer lunacy to plunge headlong into danger?"

447	ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ , ἔφη .
"Yes, I think it is."

448	τὸ δὲ εἶναι μὲν τὰς ἀναγκαιοτάτας πλείστας πράξεις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ , οἷον τάς τε πολεμικὰς καὶ τὰς γεωργικὰς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οὐ τὰς ἐλαχίστας , τοὺς δὲ πολλοὺς ἀγυμνάστως ἔχειν πρός τε ψύχη καὶ θάλπη οὐ δοκεῖ σοι πολλὴ ἀμέλεια εἶναι ;
"And considering that the great majority of essential occupations, warfare, agriculture and very many others, are carried on in the open air, don’t you think it gross negligence that so many men are untrained to withstand cold and heat?"

449	συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο .
He agreed again.

450	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι τὸν μέλλοντα ἄρχειν ἀσκεῖν δεῖν καὶ ταῦτα εὐπετῶς φέρειν ;
"Don’t you think then, that one who is going to rule must adapt himself to bear them lightly?"

451	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Certainly."

452	οὐκοῦν εἰ τοὺς ἐγκρατεῖς τούτων ἁπάντων εἰς τοὺς ἀρχικοὺς τάττομεν , τοὺς ἀδυνάτους ταῦτα ποιεῖν εἰς τοὺς μηδ’ ἀντιποιησομένους τοῦ ἄρχειν τάξομεν ;
"If then we classify those who control themselves in all these matters as fit to rule, shall we not classify those who cannot behave so as men with no claim to be rulers?"

453	συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο .
He agreed again.

454	τί οὖν ;
"Well now, 

455	ἐπειδὴ καὶ τούτων ἑκατέρου τοῦ φύλου τὴν τάξιν οἶσθα , ἤδη ποτ’ ἐπεσκέψω , εἰς ποτέραν τῶν τάξεων τούτων σαυτὸν δικαίως ἂν τάττοις ;
as you know the category to which each of these species belongs, have you ever considered in which category you ought to put yourself?"

456	ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρίστιππος ·
"I have; 

457	καὶ οὐδαμῶς γε τάττω ἐμαυτὸν εἰς τὴν τῶν ἄρχειν βουλομένων τάξιν .
and I do not for a moment put myself in the category of those who want to be rulers."

"For considering how hard a matter it is to provide for one’s own needs, I think it absurd not to be content to do that, but to shoulder the burden of supplying the wants of the community as well."

458	καὶ γὰρ πάνυ μοι δοκεῖ ἄφρονος ἀνθρώπου εἶναι τό , μεγάλου ἔργου ὄντος τοῦ ἑαυτῷ τὰ δέοντα παρασκευάζειν , μὴ ἀρκεῖν τοῦτο , ἀλλὰ προσαναθέσθαι τὸ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις πολίταις ὧν δέονται πορίζειν ·


459	καὶ ἑαυτῷ μὲν πολλὰ ὧν βούλεται ἐλλείπειν , τῆς δὲ πόλεως προεστῶτα , ἐὰν μὴ πάντα ὅσα ἡ πόλις βούλεται καταπράττῃ , τούτου δίκην ὑπέχειν , τοῦτο πῶς οὐ πολλὴ ἀφροσύνη ἐστί ;
"That anyone should sacrifice a large part of his own wishes and make himself accountable as head of the state for the least failure to carry out all the wishes of the community is surely the height of folly."

460	καὶ γὰρ ἀξιοῦσιν αἱ πόλεις τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ὥσπερ ἐγὼ τοῖς οἰκέταις χρῆσθαι .
"For states claim to treat their rulers just as I claim to treat my servants."

461	ἐγώ τε γὰρ ἀξιῶ τοὺς θεράποντας ἐμοὶ μὲν ἄφθονα τὰ ἐπιτήδεια παρασκευάζειν , αὐτοὺς δὲ μηδενὸς τούτων ἅπτεσθαι , αἵ τε πόλεις οἴονται χρῆναι τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἑαυταῖς μὲν ὡς πλεῖστα ἀγαθὰ πορίζειν , αὐτοὺς δὲ πάντων τούτων ἀπέχεσθαι .
"I expect my men to provide me with necessaries in abundance, but not to touch any of them; and states hold it to be the business of the ruler to supply them with all manner of good things, and to abstain from all of them himself."

462	ἐγὼ οὖν τοὺς μὲν βουλομένους πολλὰ πράγματα ἔχειν αὐτούς τε καὶ ἄλλοις παρέχειν οὕτως ἂν παιδεύσας εἰς τοὺς ἀρχικοὺς καταστήσαιμι ·
"And so, should anyone want to bring plenty of trouble on himself and others, I would educate him as you propose and number him with those fitted to be rulers."

463	ἐμαυτόν γε μέντοι τάττω εἰς τοὺς βουλομένους ᾗ ῥᾷστά τε καὶ ἥδιστα βιοτεύειν .
"but myself I classify with those who wish for a life of the greatest ease and pleasure that can be had."

464	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
Here Socrates asked:

465	βούλει οὖν καὶ τοῦτο σκεψώμεθα , πότερον ἥδιον ζῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες ἢ οἱ ἀρχόμενοι ;
"Shall we then consider whether the rulers or the ruled live the pleasanter life?"

466	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Certainly," replied Aristippus.

467	πρῶτον μὲν τοίνυν τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἡμεῖς ἴσμεν ἐν μὲν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ Πέρσαι μὲν ἄρχουσιν , ἄρχονται δὲ Σύροι καὶ Φρύγες καὶ Λ

υδοί ·
"To take first the nations known to us. In Asia the rulers are the Persians; the Syrians, Lydians and Phrygians are the ruled."

468	ἐν δὲ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ Σκύθαι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Μαιῶται δὲ ἄρχονται ·
"In Europe the Scythians rule, and the Maeotians are ruled."

469	ἐν δὲ τῇ Λιβύῃ Καρχηδόνιοι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Λίβυες δὲ ἄρχονται .
"In Africa the Carthaginians rule, and the Libyans are ruled."

470	τούτων οὖν ποτέρους ἥδιον οἴει ζῆν ;
"Which of the two classes, think you, enjoys the pleasanter life?"

471	ἢ τῶν Ἑλλήνων , ἐν οἷς καὶ αὐτὸς εἶ , πότερά σοι δοκοῦσιν ἥδιον οἱ κρατοῦντες ἢ οἱ κρατούμενοι , ζῆν ;
"Or take the Greeks, of whom you yourself are one; do you think that the controlling or the controlled communities enjoy the pleasanter life?"

472	ἀλλ’ ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρίστιππος , οὐδὲ εἰς τὴν δουλείαν ἐμαυτὸν τάττω , ἀλλ’ εἶναί τίς μοι δοκεῖ μέση τούτων ὁδός , ἣν πειρῶμαι βαδίζειν , οὔτε δι’ ἀρχῆς οὔτε διὰ δουλείας , ἀλλὰ δι’ ἐλευθερίας , ἥπερ μάλιστα πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν ἄγει .
"Nay," replied Aristippus, "for my part I am no candidate for slavery; but there is, as I hold, a middle path in which I am fain to walk. That way leads neither through rule nor slavery, but through liberty, which is the royal road to happiness."

473	ἀλλ’ εἰ μέν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ὥσπερ οὔτε δι’ ἀρχῆς οὔτε διὰ δουλείας ἡ ὁδὸς αὕτη φέρει , οὕτω μηδὲ δι’ ἀνθρώπων , ἴσως ἄν τι λέγοις ·
"Ah," said Socrates, "if only that path can avoid the world as well as rule and slavery, there may be something in what you say. But, since you are in the world, if you intend neither to rule nor to be ruled, and do not choose to truckle to the rulers"

474	εἰ μέντοι ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὢν μήτε ἄρχειν ἀξιώσεις μήτε ἄρχεσθαι μηδὲ τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἑκὼν θεραπεύσεις , οἶμαί σε ὁρᾶν ὡς ἐπίστανται οἱ κρείττονες τοὺς ἥττονας καὶ κοινῇ καὶ ἰδίᾳ κλαίοντας καθίσαντες δούλοις χρῆσθαι ·
 — "I think you must see that the stronger have a way of making the weaker rue their lot both in public and in private life, and treating them like slaves."

475	ἢ λανθάνουσί σε οἱ ἄλλων σπειράντων καὶ φυτευσάντων τόν τε σῖτον τέμνοντες καὶ δενδροκοποῦντες καὶ πάντα τρόπον πολιορκοῦντες τοὺς ἥττονας καὶ μὴ θέλοντας θεραπεύειν , ἕως ἂν πείσωσιν ἑλέσθαι δουλεύειν ἀντὶ τοῦ πολεμε

ῖν τοῖς κρείττσι ;
"You cannot be unaware that where some have sown and planted, others cut their corn and fell their trees, and in all manner of ways harass the weaker if they refuse to bow down, until they are persuaded to accept slavery as an escape from war with the stronger."

476	καὶ ἰδίᾳ αὖ οἱ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ δυνατοὶ τοὺς ἀνάνδρους καὶ ἀδυνάτους οὐκ οἶσθα ὅτι καταδουλωσάμενοι καρποῦνται ;
"So, too, in private life do not brave and mighty men enslave and plunder the cowardly and feeble folk?"

477	ἀλλ’ ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη , ἵνα μὴ πάσχω ταῦτα , οὐδ’ εἰς πολιτείαν ἐμαυτὸν κατακλείω , ἀλλὰ ξένος πανταχοῦ εἰμι .
"Yes, but my plan for avoiding such treatment is this. I do not shut myself up in the four corners of a community, but am a stranger in every land," Aristippus replied.

478	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
"A very cunning trick, that!" cried Socrates.

479	τοῦτο μέντοι ἤδη λέγεις δεινὸν πάλαισμα .
"For ever since the death of Sinis and Sceiron and Procrustes,"

480	τοὺς γὰρ ξένους , ἐξ οὗ ὅ τε Σίνις καὶ ὁ Σκείρων καὶ ὁ Προκρούστης ἀπέθανον , οὐδεὶς ἔτι ἀδικεῖ ·
"no one injures strangers! And yet nowadays those who take a hand in the affairs of their homeland pass laws to protect themselves from injury,"

481	ἀλλὰ νῦν οἱ μὲν πολιτευόμενοι ἐν ταῖς πατρίσι καὶ νόμους τίθενται , ἵνα μὴ ἀδικῶνται , καὶ φίλους πρὸς τοῖς ἀναγκαίοις καλουμένοις ἄλλους κτῶνται βοηθούς , καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐρύματα περιβάλλονται , καὶ ὅπλα κτῶνται οἷς ἀμυνοῦνται τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας , καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἄλλους ἔξωθεν συμμάχους κατασκευάζονται ·
"get friends to help them over and above those whom nature has given them, encompass their cities with fortresses, get themselves weapons to ward off the workers of mischief; and besides all this seek to make allies in other lands; and in spite of all these precautions, they are still wronged."

482	καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα πάντα κεκτημένοι ὅμως ἀδικοῦνται ·
"But you, with none of these advantages, spend much time on the open road, where so many come to harm; and into whatever city you enter, you rank below all its citizens,"

483	σὺ δὲ οὐδὲν μὲν τούτων ἔχων , ἐν δὲ ταῖς ὁδοῖς , ἔνθα πλεῖστοι ἀδικοῦνται , πολὺν χρόνον διατρίβων , εἰς ὁποίαν δ’ ἂν πόλιν ἀφίκῃ , τῶν πολιτῶν πάντων ἥττων ὤν , καὶ τοιοῦτος , οἵοις μάλιστα ἐπιτίθενται οἱ βουλόμενοι ἀδικεῖν , ὅμως διὰ τὸ ξένος εἶναι οὐκ ἂν ο

ἴει ἀδικηθῆναι ;
"and are one of those specially marked down for attack by intending wrongdoers; and yet, because you are a stranger, do you expect to escape injury? What gives you confidence?"

484	ἦ διότι αἱ πόλεις σοι κηρύττουσιν ἀσφάλειαν καὶ προσιόντι καὶ ἀπιόντι , θαρρεῖς ;
"Is it that the cities by proclamation guarantee your safety in your coming and going?"

485	ἢ διότι καὶ δοῦλος ἂν οἴει τοιοῦτος εἶναι οἷος μηδενὶ δεσπότῃ λυσιτελεῖν ;
"Or is it the thought that no master would find you worth having among his slaves?"

486	τίς γὰρ ἂν ἐθέλοι ἄνθρωπον ἐν οἰκίᾳ ἔχειν πονεῖν μὲν μηδὲν ἐθέλοντα , τῇ δὲ πολυτελεστάτῃ διαίτῃ χαίροντα ;
"For who would care to have a man in his house who wants to do no work and has a weakness for high living?"

487	σκεψώμεθα δὲ καὶ τοῦτο , πῶς οἱ δεσπόται τοῖς τοιούτοις οἰκέταις χρῶνται .
"But now let us see how masters treat such servants."

488	ἆρα οὐ τὴν μὲν λαγνείαν αὐτῶν τῷ λιμῷ σωφρονίζουσι ;
"Do they not starve them to keep them from immorality,"

489	κλέπτειν δὲ κωλύουσιν ἀποκλείοντες ὅθεν ἄν τι λαβεῖν ᾖ ;
"lock up the stores to stop their stealing,"

490	τοῦ δὲ δραπετεύειν δεσμοῖς ἀπείργουσι ;
"clap fetters on them so that they can’t run away,"

491	τὴν ἀργίαν δὲ πληγαῖς ἐξαναγκάζουσιν ;
"and beat the laziness out of them with whips?"

492	ἢ σὺ πῶς ποιεῖς , ὅταν τῶν οἰκετῶν τινα τοιοῦτον ὄντα καταμανθάνῃς ;
"What do you do yourself to cure such faults among your servants?"

493	κολάζω , ἔφη , πᾶσι κακοῖς , ἕως ἂν δουλεύειν ἀναγκάσω .
"I make their lives a burden to them until I reduce them to submission."

494	ἀλλὰ γάρ , ὦ Σώκρατες , οἱ εἰς τὴν βασιλικὴν τέχνην παιδευόμενοι , ἣν δοκεῖς μοι σὺ νομίζειν εὐδαιμονίαν εἶναι , τί διαφέρουσι τῶν ἐξ ἀνάγκης κακοπαθούντων , εἴ γε πεινήσουσι καὶ διψήσουσι καὶ ῥιγώσουσι καὶ ἀγρυπνήσουσι καὶ τ- ἄλλα πάντα μοχθήσουσιν ἑκόντες ;
"But how about those who are trained in the art of kingship, Socrates, which you appear to identify with happiness? How are they better off than those whose sufferings are compulsory, if they must bear hunger, thirst, cold, sleeplessness, and endure all these tortures willingly?"

495	ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅ τι διαφέρει τὸ αὐτὸ δέρμα ἑκόντα ἢ ἄκοντα μαστιγοῦσθαι ἢ ὅλως τὸ αὐτὸ σῶμα πᾶσι τοῖς τοιούτοις ἑκόντα ἢ ἄκοντα πολιορ

κεῖσθαι ἄλλο γε ἢ ἀφροσύνη πρόσεστι τῷ θέλοντι τὰ λυπηρὰ ὑπομένειν .
"For if the same back gets the flogging whether its owner kicks or consents, or, in short, if the same body, consenting or objecting, is besieged by all these torments, I see no difference, apart from the folly of voluntary suffering."

496	τί δέ , ὦ Ἀρίστιππε ;
"What, Aristippus?"

497	ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη , οὐ δοκεῖ σοι τῶν τοιούτων διαφέρειν τὰ ἑκούσια τῶν ἀκουσίων , ᾗ ὁ μὲν ἑκὼν πεινῶν φάγοι ἂν ὁπότε βούλοιτο καὶ ὁ ἑκὼν διψῶν πίοι καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὡσαύτως , τῷ δ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ταῦτα πάσχοντι οὐκ ἔξεστιν ὁπόταν βούληται παύεσθαι ;
"Socrates asked, 'Don’t you think that there is just this difference between these voluntary and involuntary sufferings, that if you bear hunger or thirst willingly, you can eat, drink, or what not, when you choose, whereas compulsory suffering is not to be ended at will?'"

498	ἔπειτα ὁ μὲν ἑκουσίως ταλαιπωρῶν ἐπ’ ἀγαθῇ ἐλπίδι πονῶν εὐφραίνεται , οἷον οἱ τὰ θηρία θηρῶντες ἐλπίδι τοῦ λήψεσθαι ἡδέως μοχθοῦσι .
"Besides, he who endures willingly enjoys his work because he is comforted by hope; hunters, for instance, toil gladly in hope of game."

499	καὶ τὰ μὲν τοιαῦτα ἆθλα τῶν πόνων μικροῦ τινος ἄξιά ἐστι , τοὺς δὲ πονοῦντας ἵνα φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσωνται , ἢ ὅπως ἐχθροὺς χειρώσωνται , ἢ ἵνα δυνατοὶ γενόμενοι καὶ τοῖς σώμασι καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς καὶ τὸν ἑαυτῶν οἶκον καλῶς οἰκῶσι καὶ τοὺς φίλους εὖ ποιῶσι καὶ τὴν πατρίδα εὐεργετῶσι , πῶς οὐκ οἴεσθαι χρὴ τούτους καὶ πονεῖν ἡδέως εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ ζῆν εὐφραινομένους , ἀγαμένους μὲν ἑαυτούς , ἐπαινουμένους δὲ καὶ ζηλουμένους ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων ;

Rewards like these are indeed of little worth after all the toil; but what of those who toil to win good friends, or to subdue enemies, or to make themselves capable in body and soul of managing their own homes well, of helping their friends and serving their country? Surely these toil gladly for such prizes and live a joyous life, well content with themselves, praised and envied by everyone else?

Yes, I understand the prompt now. Let me intersperse the corresponding English translations for each Greek sentence, following the specific sentence numbers you provided, and ensuring the English fits the Greek without altering the sentence breaks:

500. ἔτι δὲ αἱ μὲν ῥᾳδιουργίαι καὶ ἐκ τοῦ παραχρῆμα ἡδοναὶ οὔτε σώματι εὐεξίαν ἱκαναί εἰσιν ἐνεργάζεσθαι, ὥς φασιν οἱ γυμνασταί, οὔτε ψυχῇ ἐπιστήμην ἀξιόλογον οὐδεμίαν ἐμποιοῦσιν, αἱ δὲ διὰ καρτερίας ἐπιμέλειαι τῶν καλῶν τε καὶ ἀγαθῶν ἔργων ἐξικνεῖσθαι ποιοῦσιν, ὥς φασιν οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ἄνδρες.

"Moreover, indolence and present enjoyment can never bring the body into good condition, as trainers say, neither do they put into the soul knowledge of any value, but strenuous effort leads up to good and noble deeds, as good men say."

501. λέγει δέ που καὶ Ἡσίοδος ·
"And so says Hesiod somewhere:"

502. τὴν μὲν γὰρ κακότητα καὶ ἰλαδὸν ἔστιν ἑλέσθαι ῥηιδίως ·
"'Wickedness can be had in abundance easily:"

503. λείη μὲν ὁδός, μάλα δ’ ἐγγύθι ναίει.
"smooth is the road and very nigh she dwells."

504. τῆς δ’ ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάροιθεν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι ·
"But in front of virtue the gods immortal have put sweat:"

505. μακρὸς δὲ καὶ ὄρθιος οἶμος ἐς αὐτὴν καὶ τρηχὺς τὸ πρῶτον ·
"long and steep is the path to her and rough at first;"

506. ἐπὴν δ’ εἰς ἄκρον ἵκηαι, ῥηιδίη δὴ ἔπειτα πέλει, χαλεπή περ ἐοῦσα.
"but when you reach the top, then at length the road is easy, hard though it was."

507. μαρτυρεῖ δὲ καὶ Ἐπίχαρμος ἐν τῷδε ·
"And we have the testimony of Epicharmus too in the line:"

508. τῶν πόνων πωλοῦσιν ἡμῖν πάντα τἀγάθ’ οἱ θεοί.
"'The gods demand of us toil

 as the price of all good things.'"

509. καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ δὲ τόπῳ φησίν ·
"And elsewhere he says:"

510. ὦ πονηρέ, μὴ τὰ μαλακὰ μῶσο, μὴ τὰ σκλήρ’ ἔχῃς.
"'Knave, yearn not for the soft things, lest thou earn the hard.'"

511. καὶ Πρόδικος δὲ ὁ σοφὸς ἐν τῷ συγγράμματι τῷ περὶ Ἡρακλέους, ὅπερ δὴ καὶ πλείστοις ἐπιδείκνυται, ὡσαύτως περὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀποφαίνεται, ὧδέ πως λέγων, ὅσα ἐγὼ μέμνημαι.
"Aye, and Prodicus the wise expresses himself to the like effect concerning Virtue in the essay 'On Heracles' that he recites to throngs of listeners. This, so far as I remember, is how he puts it:"

512. φησὶ γὰρ Ἡρακλέα, ἐπεὶ ἐκ παίδων εἰς ἥβην ὡρμᾶτο, ἐν ᾗ οἱ νέοι ἤδη αὐτοκράτορες γιγνόμενοι δηλοῦσιν εἴτε τὴν δι’ ἀρετῆς ὁδὸν τρέψονται ἐπὶ τὸν βίον εἴτε τὴν διὰ κακίας, ἐξελθόντα εἰς ἡσυχίαν καθῆσθαι ἀποροῦντα ποτέραν τῶν ὁδῶν τράπηται ·
"When Heracles was passing from boyhood to youth’s estate, wherein the young, now becoming their own masters, show whether they will approach life by the path of virtue or the path of vice, he went out into a quiet place, and sat pondering which road to
take."

513 καὶ φανῆναι αὐτῷ δύο γυναῖκας προσιέναι μεγάλας , τὴν μὲν ἑτέραν εὐπρεπῆ τε ἰδεῖν καὶ ἐλευθέριον φύσει , κεκοσμημένην τὸ μὲν σῶμα καθαρότητι , τὰ δὲ ὄμματα αἰδοῖ , τὸ δὲ σχῆμα σωφροσύνῃ , ἐσθῆτι δὲ λευκῇ , τὴν δ’ ἑτέραν τεθραμμένην μὲν εἰς πολυσαρκίαν τε καὶ ἁπαλότητα , κεκαλλωπισμένην δὲ τὸ μὲν χρῶμα ὥστε λευκοτέραν τε καὶ ἐρυθροτέραν τοῦ ὄντος δοκεῖν φαίνεσθαι , τὸ δὲ σχῆμα ὥστε δοκεῖν ὀρθοτέραν τῆς φύσεως εἶναι , τὰ δὲ ὄμματα ἔχειν ἀναπεπταμένα , ἐσθῆτα δὲ ἐξ ἧς ἂν μάλιστα ὥρα διαλάμποι ·
"And there appeared two women of great stature making towards him. The one was fair to see and of high bearing; and her limbs were adorned with purity, her eyes with modesty; sober was her figure, and her robe was white. The other was plump and soft, with high feeding. Her face was made up to heighten its natural white and pink, her figure to exaggerate her height. Open-eyed was she; and dressed so as to disclose all her charms. Now she eyed herself; anon looked whether any noticed her; and often stole a glance at her own shadow."

514	κατασκοπεῖσθαι δὲ θαμὰ ἑαυτήν , ἐπισκοπεῖν δὲ καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος αὐτὴν θεᾶται , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ εἰς τὴν ἑαυτῆς σκιὰν ἀποβλέπειν .
"Now she eyed herself; anon looked whether any noticed her; and
often stole a glance at her own shadow."

515. ὡς δ’ ἐγένοντο πλησιαίτερον τοῦ Ἡρακλέους, τὴν μὲν πρόσθεν ῥηθεῖσαν ἰέναι τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον, τὴν δ’ ἑτέραν φθάσαι βουλομένην προσδραμεῖν τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ καὶ εἰπεῖν:
When they drew nigh to Heracles, the first pursued the even tenor of her way: but the other, all eager to outdo her, ran to meet him, crying:

516. ὁρῶ σε, ὦ Ἡράκλεις, ἀποροῦντα ποίαν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βίον τράπῃ.
"Heracles, I see that you are in doubt which path to take towards life."

517. ἐὰν οὖν ἐμὲ φίλην ποιησάμενος, ἐπὶ τὴν ἡδίστην τε καὶ ῥᾴστην ὁδὸν ἄξω σε, καὶ τῶν μὲν τερπνῶν οὐδενὸς ἄγευστος ἔσει, τῶν δὲ χαλεπῶν ἄπειρος διαβιώσῃ.
"Make me your friend; follow me, and I will lead you along the pleasantest and easiest road. You shall taste all the sweets of life; and hardship you shall never know."

518. πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ οὐ πολέμων οὐδὲ πραγμάτων φροντιεῖς, ἀλλὰ σκοπούμενος διέσῃ τί ἂν κεχαρισμένον ἢ σιτίον ἢ ποτὸν εὕροις, ἢ τί ἂν ἰδὼν ἢ ἀκούσας τερφθείης ἢ τίνων ὀσφραινόμενος ἢ ἁπτόμενος, τίσι δὲ παιδικοῖς ὁμιλῶν μάλιστ’ ἂν εὐφρανθείης, καὶ πῶς ἂν μαλακώτατα καθεύδοις, καὶ πῶς ἂν ἀπονώτατα τούτων πάντων τυγχάνοις.
"First, of wars and worries you shall not think, but shall ever be considering what choice food or drink you can find, what sight or sound will delight you, what touch or perfume; what tender love can give you most joy, what bed the softest slumbers; and how to come by all these pleasures with least trouble."

519. ἐὰν δέ ποτε γένηταί τις ὑποψία σπάνεως ἀφ’ ὧν ἔσται ταῦτα, οὐ φόβος μή σε ἀγάγω ἐπὶ τὸ πονοῦντα καὶ ταλαιπωροῦντα τῷ σώματι καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ ταῦτα πορίζεσθαι, ἀλλ’ οἷς ἂν οἱ ἄλλοι ἐργάζωνται, τούτοις σὺ χρήσῃ, οὐδενὸς ἀπεχόμενος ὅθεν ἂν δυνατὸν ᾖ τι κερδᾶναι.
"And should there arise misgiving that lack of means may stint your enjoyments, never fear that I may lead you into winning them by toil and anguish of body and soul. Nay; you shall have the fruits of others’ toil, and refrain from nothing that can bring you gain."

520. πανταχόθεν γὰρ ὠφελεῖσθαι τοῖς ἐμοὶ συνοῦσιν ἐξουσίαν ἐγὼ παρέχω.
"For to my companions I give authority to pluck advantage where they will."

521. καὶ ὁ Ἡρακλῆς ἀκούσας ταῦτα, ὦ γύναι, ἔφη, ὄνομα δέ σοι τί ἐστιν;
"Now when Heracles heard this, he asked, 'Lady, pray what is your name?"

522. ἡ δέ, οἱ μὲν ἐμοὶ φίλοι, ἔφη, καλοῦσί με Εὐδαιμονίαν, οἱ δὲ μισοῦντές με ὑποκοριζόμενοι ὀνομάζουσι Κακίαν.
"My friends call me Happiness,' she said, 'but among those that hate me I am nicknamed Vice."

523 καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ἡ ἑτέρα γυνὴ προσελθοῦσα εἶπε ·  
Meantime the other had drawn near, and she said:

524 καὶ ἐγὼ ἥκω πρὸς σέ , ὦ Ἡράκλεις , εἰδυῖα τοὺς γεννήσαντάς σε καὶ τὴν φύσιν τὴν σὴν ἐν τῇ παιδείᾳ καταμαθοῦσα , ἐξ ὧν ἐλπίζω , εἰ τὴν πρὸς ἐμὲ ὁδὸν τράποιο , σφόδρ’ ἄν σε τῶν καλῶν καὶ σεμνῶν ἀγαθὸν ἐργάτην γενέσθαι καὶ ἐμὲ ἔτι πολὺ ἐντιμοτέραν καὶ ἐπ’ ἀγαθοῖς διαπρεπεστέραν φανῆναι .  
I, too, am come to you, Heracles: I know your parents and I have taken note of your character during the time of your education. Therefore, I hope that, if you take the road that leads to me, you will turn out a right good doer of high and noble deeds, and I shall be yet more highly honoured and more illustrious for the blessings I bestow.

525 οὐκ ἐξαπατήσω δέ σε προοιμίοις ἡδονῆς , ἀλλ’ ᾗπερ οἱ θεοὶ διέθεσαν τὰ ὄντα διηγήσομαι μετ’ ἀληθείας .  
But I will not deceive you by a pleasant prelude: I will rather tell you truly the things that are, as the gods have ordained them.

526 τῶν γὰρ ὄντων ἀγαθῶν καὶ καλῶν οὐδὲν ἄνευ πόνου καὶ ἐπιμελείας θεοὶ διδόασιν ἀνθρώποις , ἀλλ’ εἴτε τοὺς θεοὺς ἵλεως εἶναί σοι βούλει , θεραπευτέον τοὺς θεούς , εἴτε ὑπὸ φίλων ἐθέλεις ἀγαπᾶσθαι , τοὺς φίλους εὐεργετητέον , εἴτε ὑπό τινος πόλεως ἐπιθυμεῖς τιμᾶσθαι , τὴν πόλιν ὠφελητέον , εἴτε ὑπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος πάσης ἀξιοῖς ἐπ’ ἀρετῇ θαυμάζεσθαι , τὴν Ἑλλάδα πειρατέον εὖ ποιεῖν , εἴτε γῆν βούλει σοι καρποὺς ἀφθόνους φέρειν , τὴν γῆν θεραπευτέον , εἴτε ἀπὸ βοσκημάτων οἴει δεῖν πλουτίζεσθαι , τῶν βοσκημάτων ἐπιμελητέον , εἴτε διὰ πολέμου ὁρμᾷς αὔξεσθαι καὶ βούλει δύνασθαι τούς τε φίλους ἐλευθεροῦν καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς χειροῦσθαι , τὰς πολεμικὰς τέχνας αὐτάς τε παρὰ τῶν ἐπισταμένων μαθητέον καὶ ὅπως αὐταῖς δεῖ χρῆσθαι ἀσκητέον ·
For of all things good and fair, the gods give nothing to an without toil and effort. If you want the favour of the gods, you must worship the gods: if you desire the love of friends, you must do good to your friends: if you covet honour from a city, you must aid that city: if you are fain to win the admiration of all Hellas for virtue, you must strive to do good to Hellas: if you want land to yield you fruits in abundance, you must cultivate that land: if you are resolved to get wealth from locks, you must care for those flocks: if you essay to grow great through war and want power to liberate your friends and subdue your foes, you must learn the arts of war from those who know them and must practise their right use:

527	εἰ δὲ καὶ τῷ σώματι βούλει δυνατὸς εἶναι , τῇ γνώμῃ ὑπηρετεῖν ἐθιστέον τὸ σῶμα καὶ γυμναστέον σὺν πόνοις καὶ ἱδρῶτι . 
if you want your body to be strong, you must accustom your body to be the servant of your mind, and train it with toil and sweat.

528	καὶ ἡ Κακία ὑπολαβοῦσα εἶπεν , ὥς φησι Πρόδικος ·
And Vice, as Prodicus tells, answered and said:

529	ἐννοεῖς , ὦ Ἡράκλεις , ὡς χαλεπὴν καὶ μακρὰν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὰς εὐφροσύνας ἡ γυνή σοι αὕτη διηγεῖται ;
"Heracles, mark you how hard and long is that road to joy, of which this woman tells?

530	ἐγὼ δὲ ῥᾳδίαν καὶ βραχεῖαν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἄξω σε .
 but I will lead you by a short and easy road to happiness."
531	καὶ ἡ Ἀρετὴ εἶπεν ·
And Virtue said:

532	ὦ τλῆμον , τί δὲ σὺ ἀγαθὸν ἔχεις ;
"What good thing is thine, poor wretch,

533	ἢ τί ἡδὺ οἶσθα μηδὲν τούτων ἕνεκα πράττειν ἐθέλουσα ;
or what pleasant thing dost thou know, if thou wilt do nought to win them?

534	ἥτις οὐδὲ τὴν τῶν ἡδέων ἐπιθυμίαν ἀναμένεις , ἀλλὰ πρὶν ἐπιθυμῆσαι πάντων ἐμπίμπλασαι , πρὶν μὲν πεινῆν ἐσθίουσα , πρὶν δὲ διψῆν πίνουσα , ἵνα μὲν ἡδέως φάγῃς , ὀψοποιοὺς μηχανωμένη , ἵνα δὲ ἡδέως πίῃς , οἴνους τε πολυτελεῖς παρασκευάζῃ καὶ τοῦ θέρους χιόνα περιθέουσα ζητεῖς , ἵνα δὲ καθυπνώσῃς ἡδέως , οὐ μόνον τὰς στρωμνὰς μαλακάς , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς κλίνας καὶ τὰ ὑπόβαθρα ταῖς κλίναις παρασκευάζῃ ·
Thou dost not even tarry for the desire of pleasant things, but fillest thyself with all things before thou desirest them, eating before thou art hungry, drinking before thou art thirsty, getting thee cooks, to give zest to eating, buying thee costly wines and running to and fro in search of snow in summer, to give zest to drinking; to soothe thy slumbers it is not enough for thee to buy soft coverlets, but thou must have frames for thy beds.

535	οὐ γὰρ διὰ τὸ πονεῖν , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ μηδὲν ἔχειν ὅ τι ποιῇς ὕπνου ἐπιθυμεῖς ·
For not toil, but the tedium of having nothing to do, makes thee long for sleep.

536	τὰ δ’ ἀφροδίσια πρὸ τοῦ δεῖσθαι ἀναγκάζεις , πάντα μηχανωμένη καὶ γυναιξὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσι χρωμένη ·
Thou dost rouse lust by many a trick, when there is no need, using men as women:

537	οὕτω γὰρ παιδεύεις τοὺς σεαυτῆς φίλους , τῆς μὲν νυκτὸς ὑβρίζουσα , τῆς δ’ ἡμέρας τὸ χρησιμώτατον κατακοιμίζουσα .
thus thou trainest thy friends, waxing wanton by night, consuming in sleep the best hours of day."

538 ἀθάνατος δὲ οὖσα ἐκ θεῶν μὲν ἀπέρριψαι, ὑπὸ δὲ ἀνθρώπων ἀγαθῶν ἀτιμάζῃ·
Immortal art thou, yet the outcast of the gods, the scorn of good men.

539 τοῦ δὲ πάντων ἡδίστου ἀκούσματος, ἐπαίνου σεαυτῆς, ἀνήκοος εἶ, καὶ τοῦ πάντων ἡδίστου θεάματος ἀθέατος·
Praise, sweetest of all things to hear, thou hearest not: the sweetest of all sights thou beholdest not,

540 οὐδὲν γὰρ πώποτε σεαυτῆς ἔργον καλὸν τεθέασαι.
for never yet hast thou beheld a good work wrought by thyself.

541 τίς δ’ ἄν σοι λεγούσῃ τι πιστεύσειε;
Who will believe what thou dost say?

542 τίς δ’ ἂν δεομένῃ τινὸς ἐπαρκέσειεν;
who will grant what thou dost ask?

543 ἢ τίς ἂν εὖ φρονῶν τοῦ σοῦ θιάσου τολμήσειεν εἶναι;
Or what sane man will dare join thy throng?

544 οἳ νέοι μὲν ὄντες τοῖς σώμασιν ἀδύνατοί εἰσι, πρεσβύτεροι δὲ γενόμενοι ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἀνόητοι, ἀπόνως μὲν λιπαροὶ διὰ νεότητος τρεφόμενοι, ἐπιπόνως δὲ αὐχμηροὶ διὰ γήρως περῶντες, τοῖς μὲν πεπραγμένοις αἰσχυνόμενοι, τοῖς δὲ πραττομένοις βαρυνόμενοι, τὰ μὲν ἡδέα ἐν τῇ νεότητι διαδραμόντες, τὰ δὲ χαλεπὰ εἰς τὸ γῆρας ἀποθέμενοι.
While thy votaries are young their bodies are weak, when they wax old, their souls are without sense; idle and sleek they thrive in youth, withered and weary they journey through old age, and their past deeds bring them shame, their present deeds distress. Pleasure they ran through in their youth: hardship they laid up for their old age.

545 ἐγὼ δὲ σύνειμι μὲν θεοῖς, σύνειμι δὲ ἀνθρώποις τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς·
But I company with gods and good men,

546 ἔργον δὲ καλὸν οὔτε θεῖον οὔτ’ ἀνθρώπειον χωρὶς ἐμοῦ γίγνεται.
and no fair deed of god or man is done without my aid.

547 τιμῶμαι δὲ μάλιστα πάντων καὶ παρὰ θεοῖς καὶ παρὰ ἀνθρώποις οἷς προσήκω, ἀγαπητὴ μὲν συνεργὸς τεχνίταις, πιστὴ δὲ φύλαξ οἴκων δεσπόταις, εὐμενὴς δὲ παραστάτις οἰκέταις, ἀγαθὴ δὲ συλλήπτρια τῶν ἐν εἰρήνῃ πόνων, βεβαία δὲ τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ σύμμαχος ἔργων, ἀρίστη δὲ φιλίας κοινωνός.
I am first in honour among the gods and among men that are akin to me: to craftsmen a beloved fellow-worker, to masters a faithful guardian of the house, to servants a kindly protector: good helpmate in the toils of peace, staunch ally in the deeds of war, best partner in friendship.

548 ἔστι δὲ τοῖς μὲν ἐμοῖς φίλοις ἡδεῖα μὲν καὶ ἀπράγμων σίτων καὶ ποτῶν ἀπόλαυσις·
To my friends meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoyment:

549 ἀνέχονται γὰρ ἕως ἂν ἐπιθυμήσωσιν αὐτῶν·
for they wait till they crave them.

550 ὕπνος δ’ αὐτοῖς πάρεστιν ἡδίων ἢ τοῖς ἀμόχθοις, καὶ οὔτε ἀπολείποντες αὐτὸν ἄχθονται οὔτε διὰ τοῦτον μεθιᾶσι τὰ δέοντα πράττειν.
And a sweeter sleep falls on them than on idle folk: they are not vexed at awaking from it, nor for its sake do they neglect to do their duties.

551 καὶ οἱ μὲν νέοι τοῖς τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἐπαίνοις χαίρουσιν, οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ταῖς τῶν νέων τιμαῖς ἀγάλλονται·
The young rejoice to win the praise of the old; the elders are glad to be honoured by the young;

552 καὶ ἡδέως μὲν τῶν παλαιῶν πράξεων μέμνηνται, εὖ δὲ τὰς παρούσας ἥδονται πράττοντες, δι’ ἐμὲ φίλοι μὲν θεοῖς ὄντες, ἀγαπητοὶ δὲ φίλοις, τίμιοι δὲ πατρίσιν·
With joy they recall their deeds past, and their present well-doing is joy to them, for through me they are dear to the gods, lovely to friends, precious to their native land.

553 ὅταν δ’ ἔλθῃ τὸ πεπρωμένον τέλος, οὐ μετὰ λήθης ἄτιμοι κεῖνται, ἀλλὰ μετὰ μνήμης τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον ὑμνούμενοι θάλλουσι.
And when comes the appointed end, they lie not forgotten and dishonoured, but live on, sung and remembered for all time.

554 τοιαῦτά σοι, ὦ παῖ τοκέων ἀγαθῶν Ἡράκλεις, ἔξεστι διαπονησαμένῳ τὴν μακαριστοτάτην εὐδαιμονίαν κεκτῆσθαι.
O Heracles, thou son of goodly parents, if thou wilt labour earnestly on this wise, thou mayest have for thine own the most blessed happiness.

555 οὕτω πως διώκει Πρόδικος τὴν ὑπ’ Ἀρετῆς Ἡρακλέους παίδευσιν·
Such, in outline, is Prodicus’ story of the training of Heracles by Virtue; 

556 ἐκόσμησε μέντοι τὰς γνώμας ἔτι μεγαλειοτέροις ῥήμασιν ἢ ἐγὼ νῦν.
only he has clothed the thoughts in even finer phrases than I have done now.


557 σοὶ δ’ οὖν ἄξιον, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε, τούτων ἐνθυμουμένῳ πειρᾶσθαί τι καὶ τῶν εἰς τὸν μέλλοντα χρόνον τοῦ βίου φροντίζειν.
But anyhow, Aristippus, it were well that you should think on these things and try to show some regard for the life that lies before you.

558 αἰσθόμενος δέ ποτε Λαμπροκλέα τὸν πρεσβύτατον υἱὸν αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν μητέρα χαλεπαίνοντα, εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ παῖ, οἶσθά τινας ἀνθρώπους ἀχαρίστους καλουμένους;
On noticing that his eldest son, Lamprocles, was out of humour with his mother, he said: Tell me, my boy, do you know that some men are called ungrateful?

559 καὶ μάλα, ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος.
Indeed I do, replied the young man.

560 καταμεμάθηκας οὖν τοὺς τί ποιοῦντας τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο ἀποκαλοῦσιν;
Do you realize how they come to have this bad name?

561 ἔγωγ’, ἔφη·
I do; 

562 τοὺς γὰρ εὖ παθόντας, ὅταν δυνάμενοι χάριν ἀποδοῦναι μὴ ἀποδῶσιν, ἀχαρίστου καλοῦσιν.
the word is used of those who do not show the gratitude that it is in their power to show for benefits received.

563 οὐκοῦν δοκοῦσί σοι ἐν τοῖς ἀδίκοις καταλογίζεσθαι τοὺς ἀχαρίστους;
You take it, then, that the ungrateful are reckoned among the unjust?


564 ἔμοιγε, ἔφη.
Yes.

565 ἤδη δέ ποτ’ ἐσκέψω εἰ ἄρα, ὥσπερ τὸ ἀνδραποδίζεσθαι τοὺς μὲν φίλους ἄδικον εἶναι δοκεῖ, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους δίκαιον εἶναι, οὕτω καὶ τὸ ἀχαριστεῖν πρὸς μὲν τοὺς φίλους ἄδικόν ἐστι, πρὸς δὲ τοὺς πολεμίους δίκαιον;
Now, seeing that enslavement is considered a just or an unjust act according as the victims are friends or enemies, have you ever considered whether the case of ingratitude is analogous, ingratitude being unjust towards friends, but just towards enemies?

566 καὶ μάλα, ἔφη·
Indeed I have;

567 καὶ δοκεῖ μοι, ὑφ’ οὗ ἄν τις εὖ παθὼν εἴτε φίλου εἴτε πολεμίου μὴ πειρᾶται χάριν ἀποδιδόναι, ἄδικος εἶναι.
and I think that it is always unjust not to show gratitude for a favour from whomsoever it is received, be he friend or enemy.

568 οὐκοῦν, εἴ γ’ οὕτως ἔχει τοῦτο, εἰλικρινής τις ἂν εἴη ἀδικία ἡ ἀχαριστία;
If that is so, must not ingratitude be injustice pure and simple?

569 συνωμολόγει.
He assented.

570 οὐκοῦν ὅσῳ ἄν τις μείζω ἀγαθὰ παθὼν μὴ ἀποδιδῷ χάριν, τοσούτῳ ἀδικώτερος ἂν εἴη;
Therefore the greater the benefits received the greater the injustice of not showing gratitude?

571 συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο.
He agreed again.

572 τίνας οὖν, ἔφη, ὑπὸ τίνων εὕροιμεν ἂν μείζω εὐηργετημένους ἢ παῖδας ὑπὸ γονέων;
Now what deeper obligation can we find than that of children to their parents?

573 οὓς οἱ γονεῖς ἐκ μὲν οὐκ ὄντων ἐποίησαν εἶναι, τοσαῦτα δὲ καλὰ ἰδεῖν καὶ τοσούτων ἀγαθῶν μετασχεῖν, ὅσα οἱ θεοὶ παρέχουσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις;
To their parents children owe their being and their portion of all fair sights and all blessings that the gods bestow on men —

574 ἃ δὴ καὶ οὕτως ἡμῖν δοκεῖ παντὸς ἄξια εἶναι ὥστε πάντες τὸ καταλιπεῖν αὐτὰ πάντων μάλιστα φεύγομεν, καὶ αἱ πόλεις ἐπὶ τοῖς μεγίστοις ἀδικήμασι ζημίαν θάνατον πεποιήκασιν ὡς οὐκ ἂν μείζονος κακοῦ φόβῳ τὴν ἀδικίαν παύσαντες.
gifts so highly prized by us that all will sacrifice anything rather than lose them; and the reason why governments have made death the penalty for the greatest crimes is that the fear of it is the strongest deterrent against crime.

575 καὶ μὴν οὐ τῶν γε ἀφροδισίων ἕνεκα παιδοποιεῖσθαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ὑπολαμβάνεις, ἐπεὶ τούτου γε τῶν ἀπολυσόντων μεσταὶ μὲν αἱ ὁδοί, μεστὰ δὲ τὰ οἰκήματα.
Of course you don’t suppose that lust provokes men to beget children, when the streets and the stews are full of means to satisfy that?

576 φανεροὶ δ’ ἐσμὲν καὶ σκοπούμενοι ἐξ ὁποίων ἂν γυναικῶν βέλτιστα ἡμῖν τέκνα γένοιτο;
We obviously select for wives the women who will bear us the best children,

577 αἷς συνελθόντες τεκνοποιούμεθα.
and then marry them to raise a family.

578 καὶ ὁ μέν γε ἀνὴρ τήν τε συντεκνοποιήσουσαν ἑαυτῷ τρέφει καὶ τοῖς μέλλουσιν ἔσεσθαι παισὶ προπαρασκευάζει πάντα, ὅσα ἂν οἴηται συνοίσειν αὐτοῖς πρὸς τὸν βίον, καὶ ταῦτα ὡς ἂν δύνηται πλεῖστα·
The man supports the woman who is to share with him the duty of parentage and provides for the expected children whatever he thinks will contribute to their benefit in life, and accumulates as much of it as he can.

579 ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ὑποδεξαμένη τε φέρει τὸ φορτίον τοῦτο, βαρυνομένη τε καὶ κινδυνεύουσα περὶ τοῦ βίου καὶ μεταδιδοῦσα τῆς τροφῆς, ᾗ καὶ αὐτὴ τρέφεται, καὶ σὺν πολλῷ πόνῳ διενεγκοῦσα καὶ τεκοῦσα τρέφει τε καὶ ἐπιμελεῖται, οὔτε προπεπονθυῖα οὐδὲν ἀγαθὸν οὔτε γιγνῶσκον τὸ βρέφος ὑφ’ ὅτου εὖ πάσχει, οὐδὲ σημαίνειν δυνάμενον ὅτου δεῖται, ἀλλ’ αὐτὴ στοχαζομένη τά τε συμφέροντα καὶ τὰ κεχαρισμένα πειρᾶται ἐκπληροῦν, καὶ τρέφει πολὺν χρόνον καὶ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ὑπομένουσα πονεῖν, οὐκ εἰδυῖα εἴ τινα τούτων χάριν ἀπολήψεται.
The woman conceives and bears her burden in travail, risking her life, and giving of her own food; and, with much labour, having endured to the end and brought forth her child, she rears and cares for it, although she has not received any good thing, and the babe neither recognizes its benefactress nor can make its wants known to her: still she guesses what is good for it and what it likes, and seeks to supply these things, and rears it for a long season, enduring toil day and night, nothing knowing what return she will get.

580 καὶ οὐκ ἀρκεῖ θρέψαι μόνον, ἀλλὰ καί, ἐπειδὰν δόξωσιν ἱκανοὶ εἶναι οἱ παῖδες μανθάνειν τι, ἃ μὲν ἂν αὐτοὶ ἔχωσιν οἱ γονεῖς ἀγαθὰ πρὸς τὸν βίον, διδάσκουσιν, ἃ δ’ ἂν οἴωνται ἄλλον ἱκανώτερον εἶναι διδάξαι, πέμπουσι πρὸς τοῦτον δαπανῶντες, καὶ ἐπιμελοῦνται πάντα ποιοῦντες ὅπως οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῖς γένωνται ὡς δυνατὸν βέλτιστοι.
Nor are the parents content just to supply food, but so soon as their children seem capable of learning they teach them what they can for their good, and if they think that another is more competent to teach them anything, they send them to him at a cost, and strive their utmost that the children may turn out as well as possible.

581 πρὸς ταῦτα ὁ νεανίσκος εἶπεν·
To this the young man replied: 

582 ἀλλά τοι εἰ καὶ πάντα ταῦτα πεποίηκε καὶ ἄλλα τούτων πολλαπλάσια, οὐδεὶς ἂν δύναιτο αὐτῆς ἀνασχέσθαι τὴν χαλεπότητα.
Nay, but even if she has done all this and far more than this, no one could put up with her vile temper.

583 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης, πότερα δέ, ἔφη, οἴει θηρίου ἀγριότητα δυσφορωτέραν εἶναι ἢ μητρός;
Which, think you, asked Socrates, is the harder to bear, a wild beast’s brutality or a mother’s?

584 ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι, ἔφη, τῆς μητρός, τῆς γε τοιαύτης.
I should say a mother’s, when she is like mine.

585 ἤδη πώποτε οὖν ἢ δακοῦσα κακόν τί σοι ἔδωκεν ἢ λακτίσασα, οἷα ὑπὸ θηρίων ἤδη πολλοὶ ἔπαθον;
Well now, many people get bitten or kicked by wild beasts; has she ever done you an injury of that sort?

586 ἀλλὰ νὴ Δία, ἔφη, λέγει ἃ οὐκ ἄν τις ἐπὶ τῷ βίῳ παντὶ βούλοιτο ἀκοῦσαι.
Oh no, but she says things one wouldn’t listen to for anything in the world.

587 σὺ δὲ πόσα, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, οἴει ταύτῃ δυσάνεκτα καὶ τῇ φωνῇ καὶ τοῖς ἔργοις ἐκ παιδίου δυσκολαίνων καὶ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς πράγματα παρασχεῖν, πόσα δὲ λυπῆσαι κάμνων;
Well, how much trouble do you think you have given her by your peevish words and froward acts day and night since you were a little child; and how much pain when you were ill?

588 ἀλλ’ οὐδεπώποτε αὐτήν, ἔφη, οὔτ’ εἶπα οὔτ’ ἐποίησα οὐδὲν ἐφ’ ᾧ ᾐσχύνθη.
But I have never yet said or done anything to cause her shame.

589 τί δ’;
What then?

590 οἴει, ἔφη, χαλεπώτερον εἶναί σοι ἀκούειν ὧν αὕτη λέγει ἢ τοῖς ὑποκριταῖς, ὅταν ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις ἀλλήλους τὰ ἔσχατα λέγωσιν;
Now do you really think it harder for you to listen to what she says than for actors when they abuse one another in a tragedy?

591 ἀλλ’, οἶμαι, ἐπειδὴ οὐκ οἴονται τῶν λεγόντων οὔτε τὸν ἐλέγχοντα ἐλέγχειν ἵνα ζημιώσῃ οὔτε τὸν ἀπειλοῦντα ἀπειλεῖν ἵνα κακόν τι ποιήσῃ, ῥᾳδίως φέρουσι.
But an actor, I suppose, doesn’t think that a question put to him will lead to punishment, or that a threat means any harm: and so he makes light of it.

592 σὺ δ’ εὖ εἰδὼς ὅτι ἃ λέγει σοι ἡ μήτηρ οὐ μόνον οὐδὲν κακὸν νοοῦσα λέγει, ἀλλὰ καὶ βουλομένη σοι ἀγαθὰ εἶναι ὅσα οὐδενὶ ἄλλῳ, χαλεπαίνεις;
And why should you be annoyed? You know well that there is no malice in what your mother says to you; on the contrary, she wishes you to be blessed above all other beings — 

593 ἢ νομίζεις κακόνουν τὴν μητέρα σοι εἶναι;
unless, indeed, you suppose that your mother is maliciously set against you?

594 οὐ δῆτα, ἔφη;
Oh no, he said,

595 τοῦτό γε οὐκ οἴομαι.
I don’t think that.

596 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης, οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, σὺ ταύτην, εὔνουν τέ σοι οὖσαν καὶ ἐπιμελομένην ὡς μάλιστα δύναται κάμνοντος ὅπως ὑγιάνῃς τε καὶ ὅπως τῶν ἐπιτηδείων μηδενὸς ἐνδεὴς ἔσει, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις πολλὰ τοῖς θεοῖς εὐχομένην ἀγαθὰ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ εὐχὰς ἀποδιδοῦσαν, χαλεπὴν εἶναι φής;
Then Socrates exclaimed: So this mother of yours is kindly disposed towards you; she nurses you devotedly in sickness and sees that you want for nothing; more than that, she prays the gods to bless you abundantly and pays vows on your behalf; and yet you say she is a trial! 

597	ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι , εἰ τοιαύτην μὴ δύνασαι φέρειν μητέρα , τ- ἀγαθά σε οὐ δύνασθαι φέρειν .
It seems to me that, if you can’t endure a mother like her, you can’t endure a good thing.

598 εἰπὲ δέ μοι, ἔφη, πότερον ἄλλον τινὰ οἴει δεῖν θεραπεύειν;
Now tell me, is there any other being whom you feel bound to regard?

599 ἢ παρεσκεύασαι μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων πειρᾶσθαι ἀρέσκειν μηδὲ πείθεσθαι μήτε στρατηγῷ μήτε ἄλλῳ ἄρχοντι;
Or are you set on trying to please nobody, and obeying neither general nor other ruler?

600 ναὶ μὰ Δί’ ἔγωγε, ἔφη.
Of course not!

601 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, καὶ τῷ γείτονι βούλῃ σὺ ἀρέσκειν, ἵνα σοι καὶ πῦρ ἐναύῃ, ὅταν τούτου δέῃ, καὶ ἀγαθοῦ τέ σοι γίγνηται συλλήπτωρ καί, ἄν τι σφαλλόμενος τύχῃς, εὐνοϊκῶς ἐγγύθεν βοηθῇ σοι;
Do you want to please your neighbour, for instance, so that he may kindle a fire for you at your need, may support you in prosperity, and in case of accident or failure may be ready to hold out a helping hand?

602 ἔγωγε, ἔφη.
Yes, I do.

603 τί δέ;
What then?

604 συνοδοιπόρον ἢ σύμπλουν, ἢ εἴ τῳ ἄλλῳ ἐντυγχάνοις, οὐδὲν ἄν σοι διαφέροι φίλον ἢ ἐχθρὸν γενέσθαι, ἢ καὶ τῆς παρὰ τούτων εὐνοίας οἴει δεῖν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι;
When you find yourself with a travelling companion on land or at sea, or happen to meet anyone, is it a matter of indifference to you whether he prove a friend or an enemy? Or do you think his goodwill worth cultivating? 

605	ἔγωγε , ἔφη .
Yes, I do.

606 εἶτα τούτων μὲν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι παρεσκεύασαι, τὴν δὲ μητέρα τὴν πάντων μάλιστά σε φιλοῦσαν οὐκ οἴει δεῖν θεραπεύειν;
And yet, when you are resolved to cultivate these, you don’t think courtesy is due to your mother, who loves you more than all?

607 οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι καὶ ἡ πόλις ἄλλης μὲν ἀχαριστίας οὐδεμιᾶς ἐπιμελεῖται οὐδὲ δικάζει, ἀλλὰ περιορᾷ τοὺς εὖ πεπονθότας χάριν οὐκ ἀποδόντας, ἐὰν δέ τις γονέας μὴ θεραπεύῃ, τούτῳ δίκην τε ἐπιτίθησι καὶ ἀποδοκιμάζουσα οὐκ ἐᾷ ἄρχειν τοῦτον, ὡς οὔτε ἂν τὰ ἱερὰ εὐσεβῶς θυόμενα ὑπὲρ τῆς πόλεως τούτου θύοντος οὔτε ἄλλο καλῶς καὶ δικαίως οὐδὲν ἂν τούτου πράξαντος;
Don’t you know that even the state ignores all other forms of ingratitude and pronounces no judgment on them, caring nothing if the recipient of a favour neglects to thank his benefactor, but inflicts penalties on the man who is discourteous to his parents and rejects him as unworthy of office, holding that it would be a sin for him to offer sacrifices on behalf of the state and that he is unlikely to do anything else honourably and rightly?

608 καὶ νὴ Δία ἐάν τις τῶν γονέων τελευτησάντων τοὺς τάφους μὴ κοσμῇ, καὶ τοῦτο ἐξετάζει ἡ πόλις ἐν ταῖς τῶν ἀρχόντων δοκιμασίαις.
Aye, and if one fail to honour his parents’ graves, the state inquires into that too, when it examines the candidates for office.

609 σὺ οὖν, ὦ παῖ, ἐὰν σωφρονῇς, τοὺς μὲν θεοὺς παραιτήσῃ συγγνώμονάς σοι εἶναι, εἴ τι παρημέληκας τῆς μητρός, μή σε καὶ οὗτοι νομίσαντες ἀχάριστον εἶναι οὐκ ἐθελήσωσιν εὖ ποιεῖν, τοὺς δὲ ἀνθρώπους φυλάξῃ μή σε αἰσθόμενοι τῶν γονέων ἀμελοῦντα πάντες ἀτιμάσωσιν, εἶτα ἐν ἐρημίᾳ φίλων ἀναφανῇς.
Therefore, my boy, if you are prudent, you will pray the gods to pardon your neglect of your mother, lest they in turn refuse to be kind to you, thinking you an ingrate; and you will beware of men, lest all cast you out, perceiving that you care nothing for your parents, and in the end you are found to be without a friend.

610 εἰ γάρ σε ὑπολάβοιεν πρὸς τοὺς γονέας ἀχάριστον εἶναι, οὐδεὶς ἂν νομίσειεν εὖ σε ποιήσας χάριν ἀπολήψεσθαι.
For, should men suppose you to be ungrateful to your parents, none would think you would be grateful for any kindness he might show you.

611 Χαιρεφῶντα δέ ποτε καὶ Χαιρεκράτην, ἀδελφὼ μὲν ὄντε ἀλλήλοιν, ἑαυτῷ δὲ γνωρίμω, αἰσθόμενος διαφερομένω, ἰδὼν τὸν Χαιρεκράτην, εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Χαιρέκρατες, οὐ δήπου καὶ σὺ εἶ τῶν τοιούτων ἀνθρώπων, οἳ χρησιμώτερον νομίζουσι χρήματα ἢ ἀδελφούς;
On another occasion he found that two brothers, Chaerophon and Chaerecrates, whom he knew well, were quarrelling. On seeing the latter, he cried, Surely, Chaerecrates, you are not one of those who hold that there is more value in goods and chattels than in a brother, 

612 καὶ ταῦτα τῶν μὲν ἀφρόνων ὄντων, τοῦ δὲ φρονίμου, καὶ τῶν μὲν βοηθείας δεομένων, τοῦ δὲ βοηθεῖν δυναμένου, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις τῶν μὲν πλειόνων ὑπαρχόντων, τοῦ δὲ ἑνός.
when they are senseless but he is sensible; they are helpless but he is helpful; when, moreover, you have many goods, but only one brother.

613 θαυμαστὸν δὲ καὶ τοῦτο, εἴ τις τοὺς μὲν ἀδελφοὺς ζημίαν ἡγεῖται, ὅτι οὐ καὶ τὰ τῶν ἀδελφῶν κέκτηται, τοὺς δὲ πολίτας οὐχ ἡγεῖται ζημίαν, ὅτι οὐ καὶ τὰ τῶν πολιτῶν ἔχει, ἀλλ’ ἐνταῦθα μὲν δύνανται λογίζεσθαι ὅτι κρεῖττον σὺν πολλοῖς οἰκοῦντα ἀσφαλῶς τ- ἀρκοῦντα ἔχειν ἢ μόνον διαιτώμενον τὰ τῶν πολιτῶν ἐπικινδύνως πάντα κεκτῆσθαι, ἐπὶ δὲ τῶν ἀδελφῶν τὸ αὐτὸ τοῦτο ἀγνοοῦσι·
It is strange too that a man should think he loses by his brothers because he cannot have their possessions as well as his own, and yet should not think that he loses by his fellow-citizens because their possessions are not his; and whereas in this case men can reflect that it is better to belong to a community, secure in the possession of a sufficiency, than to dwell in solitude with a precarious hold on all the property of their fellow-citizens, they fail to see that the same principle applies to brothers.

614 καὶ οἰκέτας μὲν οἱ δυνάμενοι ὠνοῦνται, ἵνα συνεργοὺς ἔχωσι, καὶ φίλους κτῶνται, ὡς βοηθῶν δεόμενοι, τῶν δ’ ἀδελφῶν ἀμελοῦσιν, ὥσπερ ἐκ πολιτῶν μὲν γιγνομένους φίλους, ἐξ ἀδελφῶν δὲ οὐ γιγνομένους.
Again, those who have the means buy servants to relieve them of work, and make friends because they feel the need of help; but they care nothing for their brothers, as though friendship can exist between fellow-citizens, but not between brothers!

615 καὶ μὴν πρὸς φιλίαν μέγα μὲν ὑπάρχει τὸ ἐκ τῶν αὐτῶν φῦναι, μέγα δὲ τὸ ὁμοῦ τραφῆναι, ἐπεὶ καὶ τοῖς θηρίοις πόθος τις ἐγγίγνεται τῶν συντρόφων·
Yet common parentage and common upbringing are strong ties of affection, for even brute beasts reared together feel a natural yearning for one another.

616 πρὸς δὲ τούτοις καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι ἄνθρωποι τιμῶσί τε μᾶλλον τοὺς συναδέλφους ὄντας τῶν ἀναδέλφων καὶ ἧττον τούτοις ἐπιτίθενται.
Besides, our fellow-men respect those of us who have brothers more than those who have none, and are less ready to quarrel with them.

617 καὶ ὁ Χαιρεκράτης εἶπεν·
Chaerecrates said:

618 ἀλλ’ εἰ μέν, ὦ Σώκρατες, μὴ μέγα εἴη τὸ διάφορον, ἴσως ἂν δέοι φέρειν τὸν ἀδελφὸν καὶ μὴ μικρῶν ἕνεκα φεύγειν·
If only the difference between us were a slight one, Socrates, it might perhaps be my duty to put up with my brother and not allow trifles to separate us.

619 ἀγαθὸν γάρ, ὥσπερ καὶ σὺ λέγεις, ἀδελφὸς ὢν οἷον δεῖ·
For a brother who behaves like a brother is, as you say, a blessing;

620 ὁπότε μέντοι παντὸς ἐνδέοι καὶ πᾶν τὸ ἐναντιώτατον εἴη, τί ἄν τις ἐπιχειροίη τοῖς ἀδυνάτοις;
but if his conduct is nothing like that, and is, in fact, just the opposite of what it should be, what is the use of attempting impossibilities?

621 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη·
And Socrates said:


622 πότερα δέ, ὦ Χαιρέκρατες, οὐδενὶ ἀρέσαι δύναται Χαιρεφῶν, ὥσπερ οὐδὲ σοί, ἢ ἔστιν οἷς καὶ πάνυ ἀρέσκει;
"Does everyone find Chaerophon as disagreeable as you do, Chaerecrates, or do some people think him very pleasant?" 

623 διὰ τοῦτο γάρ τοι, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἄξιόν ἐστιν ἐμοὶ μισεῖν αὐτόν, ὅτι ἄλλοις μὲν ἀρέσκειν δύναται, ἐμοὶ δὲ ὅπου ἂν παρῇ πανταχοῦ καὶ ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ ζημία μᾶλλον ἢ ὠφέλειά ἐστιν.
"Ah, Socrates," replied he, "this is precisely my reason for hating him: he is pleasant enough to other people, but whenever he is near me, he invariably says and does more to hurt than to help me."

624 ἆρ’ οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ὥσπερ ἵππος τῷ ἀνεπιστήμονι μέν, ἐγχειροῦντι δὲ χρῆσθαι ζημία ἐστίν, οὕτω καὶ ἀδελφός, ὅταν τις αὐτῷ μὴ ἐπιστάμενος ἐγχειρῇ χρῆσθαι, ζημία ἐστί;
"Well now," said Socrates, "if you try to manage a horse without knowing the right way, he hurts you. Is it so with a brother? Does he hurt if you try to deal with him when you don’t know the way?"

625 πῶς δ’ ἂν ἐγώ, ἔφη ὁ Χαιρεκράτης, ἀνεπιστήμων εἴην ἀδελφῷ χρῆσθαι, ἐπιστάμενός γε καὶ εὖ λέγειν τὸν εὖ λέγοντα καὶ εὖ ποιεῖν τὸν εὖ ποιοῦντα;
"What," exclaimed Chaerecrates, "don’t I know how to deal with a brother, when I know how to requite a kind word and a generous deed? 

626 τὸν μέντοι καὶ λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ πειρώμενον ἐμὲ ἀνιᾶν οὐκ ἂν δυναίμην οὔτ’ εὖ λέγειν οὔτ’ εὖ ποιεῖν, ἀλλ’ οὐδὲ πειράσομαι.
But I can’t speak or act kindly to one who tries to annoy me by his words and actions — and what’s more, I won’t try."

627 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη·
Socrates said:


628 θαυμαστά γε λέγεις, ὦ Χαιρέκρατες, εἰ κύνα μέν, εἴ σοι ἦν ἐπὶ προβάτοις ἐπιτήδειος ὢν καὶ τοὺς μὲν ποιμένας ἠσπάζετο, σοὶ δὲ προσιόντι ἐχαλέπαινεν, ἀμελήσας ἂν τοῦ ὀργίζεσθαι ἐπειρῶ εὖ ποιήσας πραΰνειν αὐτόν, τὸν δὲ ἀδελφὸν φὴς μὲν μέγα ἀγαθὸν εἶναι ὄντα πρὸς σὲ οἷον δεῖ, ἐπίστασθαι δὲ ὁμολογῶν καὶ εὖ ποιεῖν καὶ εὖ λέγειν οὐκ ἐπιχειρεῖς μηχανᾶσθαι ὅπως σοι ὡς βέλτιστος ᾖ.
"Chaerecrates, you astonish me! Had you a sheep dog that was friendly to the shepherds, but growled when you came near him, it would never occur to you to get angry, but you would try to tame him by kindness. You say that, if your brother treated you like a brother, he would be a great blessing, and you confess that you know how to speak and act kindly: yet you don’t set yourself to contriving that he shall be the greatest possible blessing to you." 

629 καὶ ὁ Χαιρεκράτης, δέδοικα, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, μὴ οὐκ ἔχω ἐγὼ τοσαύτην σοφίαν ὥστε Χαιρεφῶντα ποιῆσαι πρὸς ἐμὲ οἷον δεῖ.
"I fear, Socrates, that I lack the wisdom to make Chaerophon treat me as he should," said Chaerecrates.

630 καὶ μὴν οὐδέν γε ποικίλον, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, οὐδὲ καινὸν δεῖ ἐπ’ αὐτόν, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, μηχανᾶσθαι, οἷς δὲ καὶ σὺ ἐπίστασαι αὐτὸς οἴομαι ἂν αὐτὸν ἁλόντα περὶ πολλοῦ ποιεῖσθαί σε.
"And yet, there is no need, so far as I see, of any subtle or strange contriving on your part: I think you know the way to win him and to get his good opinion," said Socrates.

631 οὐκ ἂν φθάνοις, ἔφη, λέγων, εἴ τι ᾔσθησαί με φίλτρον ἐπιστάμενον ὃ ἐγὼ εἰδὼς λέληθα ἐμαυτόν.
"If you have observed that I know some spell without being conscious of my knowledge, pray tell me at once," said Chaerecrates.

632 λέγε δή μοι, ἔφη, εἴ τινα τῶν γνωρίμων βούλοιο κατεργάσασθαι, ὁπότε θύοι, καλεῖν σε ἐπὶ δεῖπνον, τί ἂν ποιοίης;
"Then tell me, now; if you wanted to get an invitation to dine with an acquaintance when he offers sacrifice, what would you do?" asked Socrates.

633 δῆλον ὅτι κατάρχοιμ' ἂν τοῦ αὐτός, ὅτε θύοιμι, καλεῖν ἐκεῖνον.
"Of course I should begin by inviting him myself when I offered sacrifice," replied Chaerecrates.

634 εἰ δὲ βούλοιο τῶν φίλων τινὰ προτρέψασθαι, ὁπότε ἀποδημοίης, ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῶν σῶν, τί ἂν ποιοίης;
"And suppose you wanted to encourage one of your friends to look after your affairs during your absence from home, what would you do?" Socrates continued.

635 δῆλον ὅτι πρότερος ἂν ἐγχειροίην ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῶν ἐκείνου, ὁπότε ἀποδημοίη.
"Of course I should first undertake to look after his affairs in his absence," answered Chaerecrates.

636 εἰ δὲ βούλοιο ξένον ποιῆσαι ὑποδέχεσθαι σεαυτόν, ὁπότε ἔλθοις εἰς τὴν ἐκείνου, τί ἂν ποιοίης;
"And suppose you wanted a stranger to entertain you when you visited his city, what would you do?" asked Socrates.

637 δῆλον ὅτι καὶ τοῦτον πρότερος ὑποδεχοίμην ἄν, ὁπότε ἔλθοι Ἀθήναζε·
"Obviously I should first entertain him when he came to Athens. 

 replied Chaerecrates.

638 καὶ εἴ γε βουλοίμην αὐτὸν προθυμεῖσθαι διαπράττειν μοι ἐφ’ ἃ ἥκοιμι, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ τοῦτο δέοι ἂν πρότερον αὐτὸν ἐκείνῳ ποιεῖν.
Yes, and if I wanted him to show himself eager in forwarding the business on which I had come, it is obvious that I should first have to do the same by him."


639 πάντ’ ἄρα σύγε τὰ ἐν ἀνθρώποις φίλτρα ἐπιστάμενος πάλαι ἀπεκρύπτου·
"It seems that you have long concealed a knowledge of all spells that were ever discovered."

640 ἢ ὀκνεῖς, ἔφη, ἄρξαι, μὴ αἰσχρὸς φανῇς, ἐὰν πρότερος τὸν ἀδελφὸν εὖ ποιῇς;
"Or is it that you hesitate to make a beginning," he said, "for fear of disgracing yourself by first showing kindness to your brother?" Socrates continued.

641 καὶ μὴν πλείστου γε δοκεῖ ἀνὴρ ἐπαίνου ἄξιος εἶναι, ὃς ἂν φθάνῃ τοὺς μὲν πολεμίους κακῶς ποιῶν, τοὺς δὲ φίλους εὐεργετῶν.
"Yet it is generally thought worthy of the highest praise to anticipate the malevolence of an enemy and the benevolence of a friend," Socrates explained.

642 εἰ μὲν οὖν ἐδόκει μοι Χαιρεφῶν ἡγεμονικώτερος εἶναι σοῦ πρὸς τὴν φιλίαν ταύτην, ἐκεῖνον ἂν ἐπειρώμην πείθειν πρότερον ἐγχειρεῖν τῷ σὲ φίλον ποιεῖσθαι·
"So if I thought Chaerophon more capable than you of showing the way to this friendship, I would try to persuade him to take the first step towards an understanding with you," said Socrates.

643 νῦν δέ μοι σὺ δοκεῖς ἡγούμενος μᾶλλον ἂν ἐξεργάσασθαι τοῦτο.
"But as things are, I think the enterprise more likely to succeed under your direction," Socrates added.

644 καὶ ὁ Χαιρεκράτης εἶπεν·
And Chaerecrates said:

645 ἄτοπα λέγεις, ὦ Σώκρατες, καὶ οὐδαμῶς πρὸς σοῦ, ὅς γε κελεύεις ἐμὲ νεώτερον ὄντα καθηγεῖσθαι·
"Strange sentiments, these, Socrates! It’s quite unlike you to urge me, the junior, to lead the way!" 

646 καίτοι τούτου γε παρὰ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις τ- ἐναντία νομίζεται, τὸν πρεσβύτερον ἡγεῖσθαι παντὸς καὶ λόγου καὶ ἔργου.
"And surely all hold the contrary opinion, that the senior, I mean, should always act and speak first," he added.

647	πῶς ;
"How so?"

648 ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης·
Socrates said:

649 οὐ γὰρ καὶ ὁδοῦ παραχωρῆσαι τὸν νεώτερον πρεσβυτέρῳ συντυγχάνοντι πανταχοῦ νομίζεται καὶ καθήμενον ὑπαναστῆναι καὶ κοίτῃ μαλακῇ τιμῆσαι καὶ λόγῳ ὑπεῖξαι;
"Is it not the general opinion that a young man should make way for an older when they meet, offer his seat to him, give him a comfortable bed, let him have the first word?"

650 ὠγαθέ, μὴ ὄκνει, ἔφη, ἀλλ’ ἐγχείρει τὸν ἄνδρα καταπραΰνειν, καὶ πάνυ ταχύ σοι ὑπακούσεται·
"My good friend, don’t hesitate, but take up the task of pacifying your man, and in no time he will respond to your overtures."

651 οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὡς φιλότιμός ἐστι καὶ ἐλευθέριος;
"Don’t you see how keen and frank he is?"

652 τὰ μὲν γὰρ πονηρὰ ἀνθρώπια οὐκ ἂν ἄλλως μᾶλλον ἕλοις ἢ εἰ δοίης τι, τοὺς δὲ καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς ἀνθρώπους προσφιλῶς χρώμενος μάλιστ’ ἂν κατεργάσαιο.
"Low fellows, it is true, yield most readily to gifts, but kindness is the weapon most likely to prevail with a gentleman."

653 καὶ ὁ Χαιρεκράτης εἶπεν·
And Chaerecrates said:

654 ἐὰν οὖν ἐμοῦ ταῦτα ποιοῦντος ἐκεῖνος μηδὲν βελτίων γίγνηται;
"And what if all my efforts lead to no improvement?"

655 τί γὰρ ἄλλο, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ἢ κινδυνεύσεις ἐπιδεῖξαι σὺ μὲν χρηστός τε καὶ φιλάδελφος εἶναι, ἐκεῖνος δὲ φαῦλός τε καὶ οὐκ ἄξιος εὐεργεσίας;
"Well, in that case, I presume you will have shown that you are honest and brotherly, he that he is base and unworthy of kindness," said Socrates.

656 ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν οἶμαι τούτων ἔσεσθαι·
"But I am confident that no such result will follow;"

657 νομίζω γὰρ αὐτόν, ἐπειδὰν αἴσθηταί σε προκαλούμενον ἑαυτὸν εἰς τὸν ἀγῶνα τοῦτον, πάνυ φιλονικήσειν ὅπως περιγένηταί σου καὶ λόγῳ καὶ ἔργῳ εὖ ποιῶν.
"for I think that, as soon as he is aware of your challenge to this contest, he will be all eagerness to outdo your kind words and actions."

658 νῦν μὲν γὰρ οὕτως, ἔφη, διάκεισθον, ὥσπερ εἰ τὼ χεῖρε, ἃς ὁ θεὸς ἐπὶ τῷ συλλαμβάνειν ἀλλήλοιν ἐποίησεν, ἀφεμένω τούτου τράποιντο πρὸς τὸ διακωλύειν ἀλλήλω, ἢ εἰ τὼ πόδε θείᾳ μοίρᾳ πεποιημένω πρὸς τὸ συνεργεῖν ἀλλήλοιν, ἀμελήσαντε τούτου ἐμποδίζοιεν ἀλλήλω.
"What if a pair of hands refused the office of mutual help for which God made them, and tried to thwart each other; or if a pair of feet neglected the duty of working together, for which they were fashioned, and took to hampering each other? That is how you two are behaving at present." 

659 οὐκ ἂν πολλὴ ἀμαθία εἴη καὶ κακοδαιμονία τοῖς ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ πεποιημένοις ἐπὶ βλάβῃ χρῆσθαι;
"Would it not be utterly senseless and disastrous to use for hindrance instruments that were made for help?"

660 καὶ μὴν ἀδελφώ γε, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, ὁ θεὸς ἐποίησεν ἐπὶ μείζονι ὠφελείᾳ ἀλλήλοιν ἢ χεῖρέ τε καὶ πόδε καὶ ὀφθαλμὼ καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὅσα ἀδελφὰ ἔφυσεν ἀνθρώποις.
"And, moreover, a pair of brothers, in my judgment, were made by God to render better service one to the other than a pair of hands and feet and eyes and all the instruments that he meant to be used as fellows."

661 χεῖρες μὲν γάρ, εἰ δέοι αὐτὰς τὰ πλέον ὀργυιᾶς διέχοντα ἅμα ποιῆσαι, οὐκ ἂν δύναιντο, πόδες δὲ οὐδ’ ἂν ἐπὶ τὰ ὀργυιὰν διέχοντα ἔλθοιεν ἅμα, ὀφθαλμοὶ δὲ οἱ δοκοῦντες ἐπὶ πλεῖστον ἐξικνεῖσθαι οὐδ’ ἂν τῶν ἔτι ἐγγυτέρω ὄντων τὰ ἔμπροσθεν ἅμα καὶ τὰ ὄπισθεν ἰδεῖν δύναιντο·
"For the hands cannot deal simultaneously with things that are more than six feet or so apart: the feet cannot reach in a single stride things that are even six feet apart: and the eyes, though they seem to have a longer range, cannot at the same moment see things still nearer than that, if some are in front and some behind."

662 ἀδελφὼ δέ, φίλω ὄντε, καὶ πολὺ διεστῶτε πράττετον ἅμα καὶ ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ ἀλλήλοιν.
"But two brothers, when they are friends, act simultaneously for mutual benefit, however far parted one from the other."

663 ἤκουσα δέ ποτε αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ φίλων διαλεγομένου ἐξ ὧν ἔμοιγε ἐδόκει μάλιστ’ ἄν τις ὠφελεῖσθαι πρὸς φίλων κτῆσίν τε καὶ χρείαν.
"Again, I once heard him give a discourse on friendship that was likely, as I thought, to help greatly in the acquisition and use of friends."

664 τοῦτο μὲν γὰρ δὴ πολλῶν ἔφη ἀκούειν, ὡς πάντων κτημάτων κράτιστον ἂν εἴη φίλος σαφὴς καὶ ἀγαθός·
"For he said that he often heard it stated that of all possessions the most precious is a good and sincere friend."

665 ἐπιμελομένους δὲ παντὸς μᾶλλον ὁρᾶν ἔφη τοὺς πολλοὺς ἢ φίλων κτήσεως.
"And yet, there is no transaction most men are so careless about as the acquisition of friends."

666 καὶ γὰρ οἰκίας καὶ ἀγροὺς καὶ ἀνδράποδα καὶ βοσκήματα καὶ σκεύη κτωμένους τε ἐπιμελῶς ὁρᾶν ἔφη καὶ τὰ ὄντα σῴζειν πειρωμένους, φίλον δέ, ὃ μέγιστον ἀγαθὸν εἶναί φασιν, ὁρᾶν ἔφη τοὺς πολλοὺς οὔτε ὅπως κτήσωνται φροντίζοντας οὔτε ὅπως οἱ ὄντες αὐτοῖς σῴζωνται.
"For I find that they are careful about getting houses and lands and slaves and cattle and furniture, and anxious to keep what they have; but though they tell one that a friend is the greatest blessing, I find that most men take no thought how to get new friends or how to keep their old ones."

667 ἀλλὰ καὶ καμνόντων φίλων τε καὶ οἰκετῶν ὁρᾶν τινας ἔφη τοῖς μὲν οἰκέταις καὶ ἰατροὺς εἰσάγοντας καὶ τ- ἄλλα τὰ πρὸς ὑγίειαν ἐπιμελῶς παρασκευάζοντας, τῶν δὲ φίλων ὀλιγωροῦντας, ἀποθανόντων τε ἀμφοτέρων ἐπὶ μὲν τοῖς οἰκέταις ἀχθομένους τε καὶ ζημίαν ἡγουμένους, ἐπὶ δὲ τοῖς φίλοις οὐδὲν οἰομένους ἐλαττοῦσθαι, καὶ τῶν μὲν ἄλλων κτημάτων οὐδὲν ἐῶντας ἀθεράπευτον οὐδ’ ἀνεπίσκεπτον, τῶν δὲ φίλων ἐπιμελείας δεομένων ἀμελοῦντας.
"Indeed, if one of their friends and one of their servants fall ill at the same time, I find that some call in the doctor to attend the servant and are careful to provide everything that may contribute to his recovery, whereas they take no heed of the friend. In the event of both dying, they are vexed at losing the servant, but don’t feel that the death of the friend matters in the least. And though none of their other possessions is uncared for and unconsidered, they are deaf to their friends’ need of attention."

668 ἔτι δὲ πρὸς τούτοις ὁρᾶν ἔφη τοὺς πολλοὺς τῶν μὲν ἄλλων κτημάτων, καὶ πάνυ πολλῶν αὐτοῖς ὄντων, τὸ πλῆθος εἰδότας, τῶν δὲ φίλων, ὀλίγων ὄντων, οὐ μόνον τὸ πλῆθος ἀγνοοῦντας, ἀλλὰ καὶ τοῖς πυνθανομένοις τοῦτο καταλέγειν ἐγχειρήσαντας, οὓς ἐν τοῖς φίλοις ἔθεσαν, πάλιν τούτους ἀνατίθεσθαι.
"And besides all this, I find that most men know the number of their other possessions, however great it may be, yet cannot tell the number of their friends, few as they are; and, if they are asked and try to make a list, they will insert names and presently remove them. So much for the thought they give to their friends!"

669 τοσοῦτον αὐτοὺς τῶν φίλων φροντίζειν.
"So much for the thought they give to their friends!"

670 καίτοι πρὸς ποῖον κτῆμα τῶν ἄλλων παραβαλλόμενος φίλος ἀγαθὸς οὐκ ἂν πολλῷ κρείττων φανείη;  
"Yet surely there is no other possession that can compare with a good friend."

671 ποῖος γὰρ ἵππος ἢ ποῖον ζεῦγος οὕτω χρήσιμον ὥσπερ ὁ χρηστὸς φίλος;  
"For what horse, what yoke of oxen is so good a servant as the good friend?"

672 ποῖον δὲ ἀνδράποδον οὕτως εὔνουν καὶ παραμόνιμον;  
"What slave so loyal and constant?"

673 ἢ ποῖον ἄλλο κτῆμα οὕτω πάγχρηστον;  
"Or what possession so serviceable?"

674 ὁ γὰρ ἀγαθὸς φίλος ἑαυτὸν τάττει πρὸς πᾶν τὸ ἐλλεῖπον τῷ φίλῳ καὶ τῆς τῶν ἰδίων κατασκευῆς καὶ τῶν κοινῶν πράξεων, καί, ἄν τέ τινα εὖ ποιῆσαι δέῃ, συνεπισχύει, ἄν τέ τις φόβος ταράττῃ, συμβοηθεῖ, τὰ μὲν συναναλίσκων, τὰ δὲ συμπράττων, καὶ τὰ μὲν συμπείθων, τὰ δὲ βιαζόμενος, καὶ εὖ μὲν πράττοντας πλεῖστα εὐφραίνων, σφαλλομένους δὲ πλεῖστα ἐπανορθῶν.  
"The good friend is on the watch to supply whatever his friend wants for building up his private fortune and forwarding his public career. If generosity is called for, he does his part: if fear harasses, he comes to the rescue, shares expenses, helps to persuade, bears down opposition: he is foremost in delighting him when he is prosperous and raising him up when he falls."

675 ἃ δὲ αἵ τε χεῖρες ἑκάστῳ ὑπηρετοῦσι καὶ οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ προορῶσι καὶ τὰ ὦτα προακούουσι καὶ οἱ πόδες διανύτουσι, τούτων φίλος εὐεργετῶν οὐδενὸς λείπεται.  
"Of all that a man can do with his hands, see for himself with his eyes, hear for himself with his ears or accomplish with his feet, in nothing is a friend backward in helping."

676 πολλάκις ἃ πρὸ αὑτοῦ τις ἢ οὐκ ἐξειργάσατο ἢ οὐκ εἶδεν ἢ οὐκ ἤκουσεν ἢ οὐ διήνυσε, ταῦτα ὁ φίλος πρὸ τοῦ φίλου ἐξήρκεσεν. 
Often, what someone on his own behalf either did not complete or did not see or did not hear about or did not get to, these things a friend has taken care of for a friend." 


677 ἀλλ’ ὅμως ἔνιοι δένδρα μὲν πειρῶνται θεραπεύειν τοῦ καρποῦ ἕνεκεν, τοῦ δὲ παμφορωτάτου κτήματος, ὃ καλεῖται φίλος, ἀργῶς καὶ ἀνειμένως οἱ πλεῖστοι ἐπιμέλονται.  
But still, some people try to cultivate a tree for its fruit, yet most bestow but an idle and listless care on their most fruitful possession, which is called a 'friend'."

678 ἤκουσα δέ ποτε καὶ ἄλλον αὐτοῦ λόγον, ὃς ἐδόκει μοι προτρέπειν τὸν ἀκούοντα ἐξετάζειν ἑαυτὸν ὁπόσου τοῖς φίλοις ἄξιος εἴη.
"Again, I once heard him exhort a listener — for so I interpreted his words — to examine himself and to ask how much he was worth to his friends."

679 ἰδὼν γάρ τινα τῶν συνόντων ἀμελοῦντα φίλου πενίᾳ πιεζομένου, ἤρετο Ἀντισθένη ἐναντίον τοῦ ἀμελοῦντος αὐτοῦ καὶ ἄλλων πολλῶν·
"For he had noticed that one of his companions was neglecting a poverty-stricken friend; so he put a question to Antisthenes in the presence of several others, including the careless friend."

680 ἆρ’ , ἔφη, ὦ Ἀντίσθενες, εἰσί τινες ἀξίαι φίλων, ὥσπερ οἰκετῶν;
"Antisthenes," he said, "have friends like servants their own values?"

681 τῶν γὰρ οἰκετῶν ὁ μέν που δυοῖν μναῖν ἄξιός ἐστιν, ὁ δὲ οὐδ’ ἡμιμναίου, ὁ δὲ πέντε μνῶν, ὁ δὲ καὶ δέκα· Νικίας δὲ ὁ Νικηράτου λέγεται ἐπιστάτην εἰς τ- ἀργύρεια πρίασθαι ταλάντου·
"For one servant, I suppose, may be worth two minas, another less than half a mina, another five minas, another no less than ten. Nicias, son of Niceratus, is said to have given a whole talent for a manager of his silver-mine."

682-683 σκοποῦμαι δὴ τοῦτο, ἔφη, εἰ ἄρα, ὥσπερ τῶν οἰκετῶν, οὕτω καὶ τῶν φίλων εἰσὶν ἀξίαι. "So I am led to inquire whether friends too may not differ in value."

684 Ναὶ μὰ Δί’, ἔφη ὁ Ἀντισθένης· "Oh yes," replied Antisthenes,

685 ἐγὼ γοῦν βουλοίμην ἂν τὸν μέν τινα φίλον μοι εἶναι μᾶλλον ἢ δύο μνᾶς, τὸν δ’ οὐδ’ ἂν ἡμιμναίου προτιμησαίμην, τὸν δὲ καὶ πρὸ δέκα μνῶν ἑλοίμην ἄν, τὸν δὲ πρὸ πάντων χρημάτων, καὶ πόνων πριαίμην ἂν φίλον μοι εἶναι.
"there are men whose friendship I, at any rate, would rather have than two minas: others I should value at less than half a mina: others I would prefer to ten minas: others I would sacrifice any sum and take any trouble to have among my friends."

686 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, εἴ γε ταῦτα τοιαῦτά ἐστι, καλῶς ἂν ἔχοι ἐξετάζειν τινὰ ἑαυτόν, πόσου ἄρα τυγχάνει τοῖς φίλοις ἄξιος ὤν, καὶ πειρᾶσθαι ὡς πλείστου ἄξιος εἶναι, ἵνα ἧττον αὐτὸν οἱ φίλοι προδιδῶσιν.
"Then if that is so," said Socrates, "were it not well that one should ask himself how much he is really worth to his friends, and try to make himself as precious as possible, in order that his friends may not be tempted to betray him?"

687 ἐγὼ γάρ τοι, ἔφη, πολλάκις ἀκούων τοῦ μὲν ὅτι προύδωκεν αὐτὸν φίλος ἀνήρ, τοῦ δ’ ὅτι μνᾶν ἀνθ’ ἑαυτοῦ μᾶλλον εἵλετο ἀνήρ, ὃν ᾤετο φίλον εἶναι, τὰ τοιαῦτα πάντα σκοπῶ, μή, ὥσπερ ὅταν τις οἰκέτην πονηρὸν πωλῇ καὶ ἀποδίδοται τοῦ εὑρόντος, οὕτω καὶ τὸν πονηρὸν φίλον, ὅταν ἐξῇ τὸ πλέον τῆς ἀξίας λαβεῖν, ἐπαγωγὸν ᾖ ἀποδίδοσθαι.
"For my part, I often hear complaints of this sort: 'A friend betrayed me,' 'one whom I regarded as my friend gave me up for the sake of a mina.' I think over such matters and reflect that, when a man sells a bad slave he takes anything he can get for him; and perhaps it is tempting to sell a bad friend when there is a chance of getting more than he is worth."

689 ἐδόκει δέ μοι καὶ εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν φίλους ὁποίους ἄξιον κτᾶσθαι φρενοῦν τοιάδε λέγων:
"In the following conversation, I thought he gave instruction for testing the qualities that make a man’s friendship worth winning."

690 εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Κριτόβουλε, εἰ δεοίμεθα φίλου ἀγαθοῦ, πῶς ἂν ἐπιχειροίημεν σκοπεῖν;
"Tell me, Critobulus," he said, "if we wanted a good friend, how should we start on the quest?"

691 ἆρα πρῶτον μὲν ζητητέον, ὅστις ἄρχει γαστρός τε καὶ φιλοποσίας καὶ λαγνείας καὶ ὕπνου καὶ ἀργίας;
"Should we seek first for one who is no slave to eating and drinking, lust, sleep, idleness?"

692 ὁ γὰρ ὑπὸ τούτων κρατούμενος οὔτ’ αὐτὸς ἑαυτῷ δύναιτ’ ἂν οὔτε φίλῳ τὰ δέοντα πράττειν.
"For the thrall of these masters cannot do his duty by himself or his friend."

693 μὰ Δί’ οὐ δῆτα, ἔφη.
"No, of course not," he said.

694 οὐκοῦν τοῦ μὲν ὑπὸ τούτων ἀρχομένου ἀφεκτέον δοκεῖ σοι εἶναι;
"Then you think we should avoid one who is subject to them?"

695 πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη.
"I do, certainly," he said.

696-697 τί γάρ; ἔφη, ὅστις δαπανηρὸς ὢν μὴ αὐτάρκης ἐστίν, ἀλλ’ ἀεὶ τῶν πλησίον δεῖται, καὶ λαμβάνων μὲν μὴ δύναται ἀποδιδόναι, μὴ λαμβάνων δὲ τὸν μὴ διδόντα μισεῖ, οὐ δοκεῖ σοι καὶ οὗτος χαλεπὸς φίλος εἶναι;
"Now what about the spendthrift who is never satisfied, who is always appealing to his neighbours for help, if he receives something, makes no return, if he receives nothing, resents it? Don’t you think he too is a troublesome friend?"

698 πάνυ γ’, ἔφη.
"Certainly," he said.

699 οὐκοῦν ἀφεκτέον καὶ τούτου;
"Then we must avoid him too?"

700 ἀφεκτέον μέντοι, ἔφη.
"We must indeed," he said.

701 τί γάρ;
What then?


702 ὅστις χρηματίζεσθαι μὲν δύναται, πολλῶν δὲ χρημάτων ἐπιθυμεῖ, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο δυσσύμβολός ἐστι, καὶ λαμβάνων μὲν ἥδεται, ἀποδιδόναι δὲ μὴ βούλεται;
"Again, what about the skilful man of business who is eager to make money, and consequently drives a hard bargain, who likes to receive but is disinclined to repay?"


703 ἐμοὶ μὲν δοκεῖ, ἔφη, οὗτος ἔτι πονηρότερος ἐκείνου εἶναι.
"So far as I see, he is even worse than the last."

704 τί δ’;
What then?


705 ὅστις διὰ τὸν ἔρωτα τοῦ χρηματίζεσθαι μηδὲ πρὸς ἓν ἄλλο σχολὴν ποιεῖται ἢ ὁπόθεν αὐτός τι κερδανεῖ;
"And what of the man who is such a keen man of business that he has no leisure for anything but the selfish pursuit of gain?"

706 ἀφεκτέον καὶ τούτου, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ;
"We must avoid him too, I think. 


707 ἀνωφελὴς γὰρ ἂν εἴη τῷ χρωμένῳ.
There is no profit in knowing him."



708 τί δέ;
What then?


709 ὅστις στασιώδης τέ ἐστι καὶ θέλων πολλοὺς τοῖς φίλοις ἐχθροὺς παρέχειν;
"And what of the quarrelsome person who is willing to provide his friends with plenty of enemies?"


710 φευκτέον νὴ Δία καὶ τοῦτον.
"We must shun him too, of course."



711 εἰ δέ τις τούτων μὲν τῶν κακῶν μηδὲν ἔχοι, εὖ δὲ πάσχων ἀνέχεται, μηδὲν φροντίζων τοῦ ἀντευεργετεῖν;
"Suppose that a man is free from all these faults, but stoops to receive kindness with no thought of returning it?"


712 ἀνωφελὴς ἂν εἴη καὶ οὗτος.
"There is no profit in him either."



713 ἀλλὰ ποῖον, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐπιχειρήσομεν φίλον ποιεῖσθαι;
"But what are the qualities for which we shall try to win a man’s friendship, Socrates?"

714	οἶμαι μέν , ὅστις τ- ἐναντία τούτων ἐγκρατὴς μέν ἐστι τῶν διὰ τοῦ σώματος ἡδονῶν , εὔοικος δὲ καὶ εὐσύμβολος ὢν τυγχάνει καὶ φιλόνικος πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐλλείπεσθαι εὖ ποιῶν τοὺς εὐεργετοῦντας αὐτόν , ὥστε λυσιτελεῖν τοῖς χρωμένοις .
"The opposite of these, I suppose. <said direct="true" rend="merge">We shall look for one who controls his indulgence in the pleasures of the body, who is truly hospitable and fair in his dealings and eager to do as much for his benefactors as he receives from them, so that he is worth knowing."

715	πῶς οὖν ἂν ταῦτα δοκιμάσαιμεν , ὦ Σώκρατες , πρὸ τοῦ χρῆσθαι ;
Then how can we test these qualities, Socrates, before intimacy begins?

716 τοὺς μὲν ἀνδριαντοποιούς, ἔφη, δοκιμάζομεν οὐ τοῖς λόγοις αὐτῶν τεκμαιρόμενοι, ἀλλ’ ὃν ἂν ὁρῶμεν τοὺς πρόσθεν ἀνδριάντας καλῶς εἰργασμένον, τούτῳ πιστεύομεν καὶ τοὺς λοιποὺς εὖ ποιήσειν.
"What test do we apply to a sculptor? We don’t judge by what he says, but we look at his statues, and if we see that the works he has already produced are beautiful, we feel confident that his future works will be as good."

717 καὶ ἄνδρα δὴ λέγεις, ἔφη, ὃς ἂν τοὺς φίλους τοὺς πρόσθεν εὖ ποιῶν φαίνηται, δῆλον εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ὕστερον εὐεργετήσοντα;
"You mean that anyone whose good works wrought upon his old friends are manifest will clearly prove a benefactor to new friends also?"

718 καὶ γὰρ ἵπποις, ἔφη, ὃν ἂν ὁρῶ τοῖς πρόσθεν καλῶς χρώμενον, τοῦτον κἂν ἄλλοις οἶμαι καλῶς χρῆσθαι.
"Yes; for when I find that an owner of horses has been in the habit of treating his beasts well I think that he will treat others equally well."

719 εἶεν, ἔφη;
"Granted!" he said. 



720 ὃς δ’ ἂν ἡμῖν ἄξιος φιλίας δοκῇ εἶναι, πῶς χρὴ φίλον τοῦτον ποιεῖσθαι;
"but when we have found a man who seems worthy of our friendship, how are we to set about making him our friend?"

721 πρῶτον μέν, ἔφη, τὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν ἐπισκεπτέον, εἰ συμβουλεύουσιν αὐτὸν φίλον ποιεῖσθαι.
"First we should seek guidance from the gods, whether they counsel us to make a friend of him."

722 τί οὖν;
"And next? 

723 ἔφη, ὃν ἂν ἡμῖν τε δοκῇ καὶ οἱ θεοὶ μὴ ἐναντιῶνται, ἔχεις εἰπεῖν ὅπως οὗτος θηρατέος;
Supposing that we have chosen and the gods approve him, can you say how is he to be hunted?"

724 μὰ Δί’, ἔφη, οὐ κατὰ πόδας, ὥσπερ ὁ λαγῶς, οὐδ’ ἀπάτῃ, ὥσπερ αἱ ὄρνιθες, οὐδὲ βίᾳ, ὥσπερ οἱ ἐχθροί;
"Surely not like a hare by swift pursuit, nor like birds by cunning, nor like enemies by force."

725 ἄκοντα γὰρ φίλον ἑλεῖν ἐργῶδες;
"It is no light task to capture a friend against his will."

726 χαλεπὸν δὲ καὶ δήσαντα κατέχειν, ὥσπερ δοῦλον;
"And hard to keep him a prisoner like a slave."

727 ἐχθροὶ γὰρ μᾶλλον ἢ φίλοι γίγνονται οἱ ταῦτα πάσχοντες;
"Hatred, rather than friendship, comes of that treatment."

728 φίλοι δὲ πῶς;
"But how does friendship come?"

729 ἔφη;
he said.

730 εἶναι μέν τινάς φασιν ἐπῳδάς, ἃς οἱ ἐπιστάμενοι ἐπᾴδοντες οἷς ἂν βούλωνται φίλους αὐτοὺς ποιοῦνται;
"There are spells, they say, wherewith those who know charm whom they will and make friends of them."

731 εἶναι δὲ καὶ φίλτρα, οἷς οἱ ἐπιστάμενοι πρὸς οὓς ἂν βούλωνται χρώμενοι φιλοῦνται ὑπ’ αὐτῶν;
"And drugs which those who know give to whom they choose and win their love."

732 πόθεν οὖν, ἔφη, ταῦτα μάθοιμεν ἄν;
"How then can we learn them?"

733 ἃ μὲν αἱ Σειρῆνες ἐπῇδον τῷ Ὀδυσσεῖ ἤκουσας Ὁμήρου, ὧν ἐστιν ἀρχὴ τοιάδε τις·
"You have heard from Homer the spell that the Sirens put on Odysseus. It begins like this:"

734 δεῦρ’ ἄγε δή, πολύαιν’ Ὀδυσεῦ, μέγα κῦδος Ἀχαιῶν.
'Hither, come hither, renowned Odysseus, great glory of the Achaeans.'

735 ταύτην οὖν, ἔφη, τὴν ἐπῳδήν, ὦ Σώκρατες, καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις αἱ Σειρῆνες ἐπᾴδουσαι κατεῖχον, ὥστε μὴ ἀπιέναι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν τοὺς ἐπᾳσθέντας;
"Then did the Sirens chant in this strain for other folk too, Socrates, so as to keep those who were under the spell from leaving them?"

736 οὐκ ἀλλὰ τοῖς ἐπ’ ἀρετῇ φιλοτιμουμένοις οὕτως ἐπῇδον.
"No, only for those that yearned for the fame that virtue gives."

737 σχεδόν τι λέγεις τοιαῦτα χρῆναι ἑκάστῳ ἐπᾴδειν, οἷα μὴ νομιεῖ ἀκούων τὸν ἐπαινοῦντα καταγελῶντα λέγειν;
"You mean, I take it, that the spell must be fitted to the listener, so that he may not take the praise for mockery."

738 οὕτω μὲν γὰρ ἐχθίων τ’ ἂν εἴη καὶ ἀπελαύνοι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ, εἰ τὸν εἰδότα ὅτι μικρός τε καὶ αἰσχρὸς καὶ ἀσθενής ἐστιν ἐπαινοίη λέγων ὅτι καλός τε καὶ μέγας καὶ ἰσχυρός ἐστιν.
"Yes; for to praise one for his beauty, his stature and his strength who is conscious that he is short, ugly and puny, is the way to repel him and make him dislike you more."

739 ἄλλας δέ τινας οἶσθα ἐπῳδάς;
"Do you know any other spells?"

740 οὐκ ἀλλ’ ἤκουσα μὲν ὅτι Περικλῆς πολλὰς ἐπίσταιτο, ἃς ἐπᾴδων τῇ πόλει ἐποίει αὐτὴν φιλεῖν αὑτόν.
"No, but I have heard that Pericles knew many and put them on the city, and so made her love him."

741 Θεμιστοκλῆς δὲ πῶς ἐποίησε τὴν πόλιν φιλεῖν αὑτόν;
"And how did Themistocles make the city love him?"

742 μὰ Δί’ οὐκ ἐπᾴδων, ἀλλὰ περιάψας τι ἀγαθὸν αὐτῇ.
"Not by spells: no, no; but by hanging some good amulet about her."

743 δοκεῖς μοι λέγειν, ὦ Σώκρατες, ὡς, εἰ μέλλοιμεν ἀγαθόν τινα κτήσασθαι φίλον, αὐτοὺς ἡμᾶς ἀγαθοὺς δεῖ γενέσθαι λέγειν τε καὶ πράττειν.
"I think you mean, Socrates, that if we are to win a good man’s friendship, we ourselves must be good in word and deed alike."

744 σὺ δ’ ᾤου, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, οἷόν τ’ εἶναι καὶ πονηρὸν ὄντα χρηστοὺς φίλους κτήσασθαι;
"But you imagined that a bad man could win the friendship of honest men?"

745 ἑώρων γάρ , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος , ῥήτοράς τε φαύλους ἀγαθοῖς δημηγόροις φίλους ὄντας , καὶ στρατηγεῖν οὐχ ἱκανοὺς πάνυ στρατηγικοῖς ἀνδράσιν ἑταίρους .
"I did," answered Critobulus, "for I saw that poor orators have good speakers among their friends, and some who are incapable of commanding an army are intimate with great generals."

746 ἆρ’ οὖν , ἔφη , καί , περὶ οὗ διαλεγόμεθα , οἶσθά τινας οἳ ἀνωφελεῖς ὄντες ὠφελίμους δύνανται φίλους ποιεῖσθαι ;
"Coming then to the point under discussion, do you know cases of useless persons making useful friends?" asked Socrates.

747 μὰ Δί’ οὐ δῆτ’ , ἔφη ·
"Assuredly not," he replied;

748 ἀλλ’ εἰ ἀδύνατόν ἐστι πονηρὸν ὄντα καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς φίλους κτήσασθαι , ἐκεῖνο ἤδη μέλει μοι , εἰ ἔστιν αὐτὸν καλὸν κ- ἀγαθὸν γενόμενον ἐξ ἑτοίμου τοῖς καλοῖς κ- ἀγαθοῖς φίλον εἶναι .
"but if it is impossible that the bad should gain the friendship of gentlemen, then I am anxious to know whether it is quite easy for a gentleman as a matter of course to be the friend of gentlemen?" he added.

749 ὃ ταράττει σε , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , ὅτι πολλάκις ἄνδρας καὶ τὰ καλὰ πράττοντας καὶ τῶν αἰσχρῶν ἀπεχομένους ὁρᾷς ἀντὶ τοῦ φίλους εἶναι στασιάζοντας ἀλλήλοις καὶ χαλεπώτερον χρωμένους τῶν μηδενὸς ἀξίων ἀνθρώπων .
"Your trouble is, Critobulus, that you often find men who do good and shun evil not on friendly terms, but apt to quarrel and treat one another more harshly than worthless fellows," Socrates observed.

750 καὶ οὐ μόνον γ’ , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος , οἱ ἰδιῶται τοῦτο ποιοῦσιν , ἀλλὰ καὶ πόλεις αἱ τῶν τε καλῶν μάλιστα ἐπιμελόμεναι καὶ τὰ αἰσχρὰ ἥκιστα προσιέμεναι πολλάκις πολεμικῶς ἔχουσι πρὸς ἀλλήλας .
"Yes," said Critobulus, "and such conduct is not confined to individuals, but even the cities that care most for the right and have least liking for the wrong are often at enmity."

751 ἃ λογιζόμενος πάνυ ἀθύμως ἔχω πρὸς τὴν τῶν φίλων κτῆσιν ·
"These thoughts make me despair about the acquisition of friends."

752 οὔτε γὰρ τοὺς πονηροὺς ὁρῶ φίλους ἀλλήλοις δυναμένους εἶναι ·
"For I see on the one hand that rogues cannot be friends with one another —"

753 πῶς γὰρ ἂν ἢ ἀχάριστοι ἢ ἀμελεῖς ἢ πλεονέκται ἢ ἄπιστοι ἢ ἀκρατεῖς ἄνθρωποι δύναιντο φίλοι γενέσθαι ;
"for how could the ungrateful, the careless, the selfish, the faithless, the incontinent, form friendships?"

754 οἱ μὲν οὖν πονηροὶ πάντως ἔμοιγε δοκοῦσιν ἀλλήλοις ἐχθροὶ μᾶλλον ἢ φίλοι πεφυκέναι .
"I feel sure, then, that rogues are by their nature enemies rather than friends."

755 ἀλλὰ μήν , ὥσπερ σὺ λέγεις , οὐδ’ ἂν τοῖς χρηστοῖς οἱ πονηροί ποτε συναρμόσειαν εἰς φιλίαν ·
"But then, as you point out, neither can rogues ever join in friendship with honest men,"

756 πῶς γὰρ οἱ τὰ πονηρὰ ποιοῦντες τοῖς τὰ τοιαῦτα μισοῦσι φίλοι γένοιντ’ ἄν ;
"for how can wrongdoers become friendly with those who hate their conduct?"

757 εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ οἱ ἀρετὴν ἀσκοῦντες στασιάζουσί τε περὶ τοῦ πρωτεύειν ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι καὶ φθονοῦντες ἑαυτοῖς μισοῦσιν ἀλλήλους , τίνες ἔτι φίλοι ἔσονται καὶ ἐν τίσιν ἀνθρώποις εὔνοια καὶ πίστις ἔσται ;
"And if we must add that the votaries of virtue strive with one another for headship in cities, and envy and hate one another, who then will be friends and where shall loyalty and faithfulness be found?"

758 ἀλλ’ ἔχει μέν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ποικίλως πως ταῦτα , ὦ Κριτόβουλε .
"Ah, Critobulus, but there is a strange complication in these matters."

759 φύσει γὰρ ἔχουσιν οἱ ἄνθρωποι τὰ μὲν φιλικά ·
"Some elements in man’s nature make for friendship:"

760 δέονταί τε γὰρ ἀλλήλων καὶ ἐλεοῦσι καὶ συνεργοῦντες ὠφελοῦσι καὶ τοῦτο συνιέντες χάριν ἔχουσιν ἀλλήλοις ·
"men need one another, feel pity, work together for their common good, and, conscious of the facts, are grateful to one another."

761 τὰ δὲ πολεμικά ·
"But there are hostile elements in men."

762 τά τε γὰρ αὐτὰ καλὰ καὶ ἡδέα νομίζοντες ὑπὲρ τούτων μάχονται καὶ διχογνωμονοῦντες ἐναντιοῦνται ·
"For, holding the same things to be honourable and pleasant, they fight for them, fall out and take sides."

763 πολεμικὸν δὲ καὶ ἔρις καὶ ὀργή ·
"Strife and anger lead to hostility,"

764 καὶ δυσμενὲς μὲν ὁ τοῦ πλεονεκτεῖν ἔρως , μισητὸν δὲ ὁ φθόνος .
"covetousness to enmity, jealousy to hatred."

765 ἀλλ’ ὅμως διὰ τούτων πάντων ἡ φιλία διαδυομένη συνάπτει τοὺς καλούς τε κ- ἀγαθούς .
"Nevertheless through all these barriers friendship slips, and unites the gentle natures."

766 διὰ γὰρ τὴν ἀρετὴν αἱροῦνται μὲν ἄνευ πόνου τὰ μέτρια κεκτῆσθαι μᾶλλον ἢ διὰ πολέμου πάντων κυριεύειν ,
"For thanks to their virtue these prize the untroubled security of moderate possessions above sovereignty won by war;"

καὶ δύνανται πεινῶντες καὶ διψῶντες ἀλύπως σίτου καὶ ποτοῦ κοινωνεῖν καὶ τοῖς τῶν ὡραίων ἀφροδισίοις ἡδόμενοι καρτερεῖν , ὥστε μὴ λυπεῖν οὓς μὴ προσήκει ·
"despite hunger and thirst, they can share their food and drink without a pang; and although they delight in the charms of beauty they can resist the lure and avoid offending those whom they should respect;"

767 δύνανται δὲ καὶ χρημάτων οὐ μόνον τοῦ πλεονεκτεῖν ἀπεχόμενοι νομίμως κοινωνεῖν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐπαρκεῖν ἀλλήλοις ·
"they can not only share wealth lawfully and keep from covetousness, but also supply one another’s wants;"

768 δύνανται δὲ καὶ τὴν ἔριν οὐ μόνον ἀλύπως , ἀλλὰ καὶ συμφερόντως ἀλλήλοις διατίθεσθαι καὶ τὴν ὀργὴν κωλύειν εἰς τὸ μεταμελησόμενον προϊέναι ·
"they can compose strife not only without pain, but with advantage to one another, and prevent anger from pursuing its way towards remorse:"

769 τὸν δὲ φθόνον παντάπασιν ἀφαιροῦσι , τὰ μὲν ἑαυτῶν ἀγαθὰ τοῖς φίλοις οἰκεῖα παρέχοντες , τὰ δὲ τῶν φίλων ἑαυτῶν νομίζοντες .
"but jealousy they take away utterly, regarding their own good things as belonging to their friends, and thinking their friend’s good things to be their own."

770 πῶς οὖν οὐκ εἰκὸς τοὺς καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς καὶ τῶν π

ολιτικῶν τιμῶν μὴ μόνον ἀβλαβεῖς , ἀλλὰ καὶ ὠφελίμους ἀλλήλοις κοινωνοὺς εἶναι ;
"Surely, then, it is likely that true gentlemen will share public honours too not only without harm to one another, but to their common benefit?"

771 οἱ μὲν γὰρ ἐπιθυμοῦντες ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι τιμᾶσθαί τε καὶ ἄρχειν , ἵνα ἐξουσίαν ἔχωσι χρήματά τε κλέπτειν καὶ ἀνθρώπους βιάζεσθαι καὶ ἡδυπαθεῖν , ἄδικοί τε καὶ πονηροὶ ἂν εἶεν καὶ ἀδύνατοι ἄλλῳ συναρμόσαι .
"For those who desire to win honour and to bear rule in their cities that they may have power to embezzle, to treat others with violence, to live in luxury, are bound to be unjust, unscrupulous, incapable of unity."

772 εἰ δέ τις ἐν πόλει τιμᾶσθαι βουλόμενος , ὅπως αὐτός τε μὴ ἀδικῆται καὶ τοῖς φίλοις τὰ δίκαια βοηθεῖν δύνηται , καὶ ἄρξας ἀγαθόν τι ποιεῖν τὴν πατρίδα πειρᾶται ,
"But if a man seeks to be honoured in a state that he may not be the victim of injustice himself and may help his friends in a just cause, and when he takes office may try to do some good to his country,"

διὰ τί ὁ τοιοῦτος ἄλλῳ τοιούτῳ οὐκ ἂν δύναιτο συναρμόσαι ;
"why should he be incapable of union with one like himself?"

773 πότερον τοὺς φίλους ὠφελεῖν μετὰ τῶν καλῶν κ- ἀγαθῶν ἧττον δυνήσεται ;
"Will his connexion with other gentlemen render him less capable of serving his friends?"

774 ἢ τὴν πόλιν εὐεργετεῖν ἀδυνατώτερος ἔσται καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς ἔχων συνεργούς ;
"Will he be less able to benefit his city with the help of other gentlemen?"

775 ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν τοῖς γυμνικοῖς ἀγῶσι δῆλόν ἐστιν , ὅτι , εἰ ἐξῆν τοῖς κρατίστοις συνθεμένους ἐπὶ τοὺς χείρους ἰέναι , πάντας ἂν τοὺς ἀγῶνας οὗτοι ἐνίκων καὶ πάντα τὰ ἆθλα οὗτοι ἐλάμβανον .
"Even in the public games it is clear that, if the strongest competitors were allowed to join forces against the weaker, they would win all the events, they would carry off all the prizes."

776 ἐπεὶ οὖν ἐκεῖ μὲν οὐκ ἐῶσι τοῦτο ποιεῖν , ἐν δὲ τοῖς πολιτικοῖς , ἐν οἷς οἱ καλοὶ κ- ἀγαθοὶ κρατιστεύουσιν , οὐδεὶς κωλύει μεθ’ οὗ ἄν τις βούληται τὴν πόλιν εὐεργετεῖν ,
"True, that is not permitted in the games; but in politics, where the gentlemen are the strongest, nobody prevents anyone from forming any combination he may choose for the benefit of the state;"

πῶς οὐ λυσιτελεῖ τοὺς βελτίστους φίλους κτησ

άμενον πολιτεύεσθαι , τούτοις κοινωνοῖς καὶ συνεργοῖς τῶν πράξεων μᾶλλον ἢ ἀνταγωνισταῖς χρώμενον ;
"surely, then, in public life it is a gain to make friends with the best, and to see in them partners and fellow-workers in a common cause, and not rivals."

777 ἀλλὰ μὴν κ- ἐκεῖνο δῆλον , ὅτι κἂν πολεμῇ τίς τινι , συμμάχων δεήσεται , καὶ τούτων πλειόνων , ἐὰν καλοῖς κ- ἀγαθοῖς ἀντιτάττηται .
"But, again, it is equally clear that anyone who goes to war will need allies, and more of them if he is to fight an army of gentlemen."

778 καὶ μὴν οἱ συμμαχεῖν ἐθέλοντες εὖ ποιητέοι , ἵνα θέλωσι προθυμεῖσθαι ·
"Moreover, those who are willing to fight at your side must be well treated that they may be willing to exert themselves;"

779 πολὺ δὲ κρεῖττον τοὺς βελτίστους ἐλάττονας εὖ ποιεῖν ἢ τοὺς χείρονας πλείονας ὄντας ·
"and it is a far sounder plan to show kindness to the best, who are fewer in number, than to the worst, who are the greater company;"

780 οἱ γὰρ πονηροὶ πολὺ πλειόνων εὐεργεσιῶν ἢ οἱ χρηστοὶ δέονται .
"for the bad want many more kindnesses than the good."

781 ἀλλὰ θαρρῶν , ἔφη , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , πειρῶ ἀγαθὸς γίγνεσθαι , καὶ τοιοῦτος γενόμενος θηρᾶν ἐπιχείρει τοὺς καλούς τε κ- ἀγαθούς .
"Courage, Critobulus; try to be good, and when you have achieved that, set about catching your gentleman."

782 ἴσως δ’ ἄν τί σοι κ- ἐγὼ συλλαβεῖν εἰς τὴν τῶν καλῶν τε κ- ἀγαθῶν θήραν ἔχοιμι διὰ τὸ ἐρωτικὸς εἶναι ·
"Maybe, I myself, as an adept in love, can lend you a hand in the pursuit of gentlemen."

783 δεινῶς γάρ , ὧν ἂν ἐπιθυμήσω ἀνθρώπων , ὅλος ὥρμημαι ἐπὶ τὸ φιλῶν τε αὐτοὺς ἀντιφιλεῖσθαι ὑπ’ αὐτῶν καὶ ποθῶν ἀντιποθεῖσθαι , καὶ ἐπιθυμῶν συνεῖναι καὶ ἀντεπιθυμεῖσθαι τῆς συνουσίας .
"For when I want to catch anyone it’s surprising how I strain every nerve to have my love returned, my longing reciprocated by him, in my eagerness that he shall want me as much as I want him."

784 ὁρῶ δὲ καὶ σοὶ τούτων δεῆσον , ὅταν ἐπιθυμήσῃς φιλίαν πρός τινας ποιεῖσθαι ·
"I see that you too will feel this need when you want to form a friendship."

785 μὴ οὖν ἀποκρύπτου με οἷς ἂν βούλῃ φίλος γενέσθαι ·
"So do not hide from me the names of those whom you wish to make your friends;"

786 διὰ γὰρ τὸ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τοῦ ἀρέσαι τῷ ἀρέσκοντί μοι οὐκ ἀπείρως οἶμαι ἔχειν πρὸς θήραν ἀνθρώπων .
"for I am careful to please him who pleases me, and so, I think, I am not without experience in the pursuit of men."

787 καὶ ὁ Κριτόβουλος ἔφη ·
"And Critobulus said:"

788 καὶ μήν , ὦ Σώκρατες , τούτων ἐγὼ τῶν μαθημάτων πάλαι ἐπιθυμῶ ἄλλως τε καὶ εἰ ἐξαρκέσει μοι ἡ αὐ

τὴ ἐπιστήμη ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς τὰς ψυχὰς καὶ ἐπὶ τοὺς καλοὺς τὰ σώματα .
"Well, Socrates," said Critobulus in reply, "these are the lessons I have long wished to learn, especially if the same skill will serve to win a good soul and a fair face."

789 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
"Ah no, Critobulus," said Socrates,

790 ἀλλ’ , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ ἐμῇ ἐπιστήμῃ τὸ τὰς χεῖρας προσφέροντα ποιεῖν ὑπομένειν τοὺς καλούς .
"it belongs not to my skill to lay hands on the fair and force them to submit."

791 πέπεισμαι δὲ καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς Σκύλλης διὰ τοῦτο φεύγειν τοὺς ἀνθρώπους , ὅτι τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῖς προσέφερε ·
"I am convinced that the reason why men fled from Scylla was that she laid hands on them;"

792 τὰς δέ γε Σειρῆνας , ὅτι τὰς χεῖρας οὐδενὶ προσέφερον , ἀλλὰ πᾶσι πόρρωθεν ἐπῇδον , πάντας φασὶν ὑπομένειν καὶ ἀκούοντας αὐτῶν κηλεῖσθαι .
"but the Sirens laid hands on no man; from far away they sang to all, and therefore, we are told, all submitted, and hearing were enchanted."

793 καὶ ὁ Κριτόβουλος ἔφη ·
And Critobulus said:

794 ὡς οὐ προσοίσοντος τὰς χεῖρας , εἴ τι ἔχεις ἀγαθὸν εἰς φίλων κτῆσιν , δίδασκε .
"I am not going to put a hand on anyone, so teach me any good plan you know for making friends."

795 οὐδὲ τὸ στόμα οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , πρὸς τὸ στόμα προσοίσεις ;
"Then won’t you put lip to lip either?" asked Socrates.

796 θάρρει , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος ·
"Courage!" answered Critobulus,

797 οὐδὲ γὰρ τὸ στόμα πρὸς τὸ στόμα προσοίσω οὐδενί , ἐὰν μὴ καλὸς ᾖ .
"I won’t touch a lip with mine either — unless the owner is fair!"

798 εὐθύς , ἔφη , σύγε , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , τ- ἐναντίον τοῦ συμφέροντος εἴρηκας .
"That’s an unfortunate beginning for you, Critobulus! The fair won’t submit to such conduct;"

799 οἱ μὲν γὰρ καλοὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα οὐχ ὑπομέν

ουσιν ·
"but the ugly like it, supposing that they are called fair for the beauty of their souls."

800 οἱ δὲ αἰσχροὶ καὶ ἡδέως προσίενται , νομίζοντες διὰ τὴν ψυχὴν καλοὶ καλεῖσθαι .
Critobulus replied:

801 καὶ ὁ Κριτόβουλος ἔφη ·
"A kiss for the fair," exclaimed Critobulus,

802 ὡς τοὺς μὲν καλοὺς φιλήσοντός μου , τοὺς δ’ ἀγαθοὺς καταφιλήσοντος , θαρρῶν δίδασκε τῶν φίλων τὰ θηρατικά .
"and a thousand kisses for the good! That shall be my motto, so take courage, and teach me the art of catching friends."

803 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
"Well then, Critobulus," said Socrates,

804 ὅταν οὖν , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , φίλος τινὶ βούλῃ γενέσθαι , ἐάσεις με κατειπεῖν σου πρὸς αὐτὸν ὅτι ἄγασαί τε αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐπιθυμεῖς φίλος αὐτοῦ εἶναι ;
"when you want to make a new friend, will you let me warn him that you admire him and want his friendship?"

805 κατηγόρει , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος ·
"Warn him by all means," said Critobulus,

806 οὐδένα γὰρ οἶδα μισοῦντα τοὺς ἐπαινοῦντας .
"no one hates those who praise him, so far as I know."

807 ἐὰν δέ σου προσκατηγορήσω , ἔφη , ὅτι διὰ τὸ ἄγασθαι αὐτοῦ καὶ εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχεις πρὸς αὐτόν , ἆρα μὴ διαβάλλεσθαι δόξεις ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ ;
"Suppose I go on to warn him that your admiration makes you well disposed towards him, you won’t think I am slandering you, will you?" Socrates asked.

808 ἀλλὰ καὶ αὐτῷ μοι , ἔφη , ἐγγίγνεται εὔνοια πρὸς οὓς ἂν ὑπολάβω εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχειν πρὸς ἐμέ .
"Nay; when I guess that anyone feels well disposed towards me, a like goodwill towards him is begotten in me," Critobulus replied.

809 ταῦτα μὲν δή , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ἐξέσται μοι λέγειν περὶ σοῦ πρὸς οὓς ἂν βούλῃ φίλους ποιήσασθαι ·
"Then you will permit me to say this about you to those whose friendship you desire," Socrates said.

810 ἐὰν δέ μοι ἔτι ἐξουσίαν δῷς λέγειν περὶ σοῦ ὅτι ἐπιμελής τε τῶν φίλων εἶ καὶ οὐδενὶ οὕτω χαίρεις ὡς φίλοις ἀγαθοῖς , καὶ ἐπί τε τοῖς καλοῖς ἔργοις τῶν φίλων ἀγάλλῃ οὐχ ἧττον ἢ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ καὶ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς τῶν φίλων χαίρεις οὐδὲν ἧττον ἢ ἐπὶ τοῖς ἑαυτοῦ , ὅπως τε ταῦτα γίγνηται τοῖς φίλοις οὐκ ἀποκάμνεις μηχανώμενος , καὶ ὅτι ἔγνωκας ἀνδρὸς ἀρετὴν εἶναι νικᾶν τοὺς μὲν φίλους εὖ ποιοῦντα , τοὺς δ’ ἐχθροὺς κακῶς , πάνυ ἂν οἶμαί σοι ἐπιτήδειον εἶναί με σύνθηρον τῶν ἀγαθῶν φίλων .
"Now if you will give me permission to tell them besides that you are devoted to your friends and nothing gives you so much pleasure as good friends; that you take as much pride in your friends’ fair achievements as in your own, and as much pleasure in your friends’ good as in your own, and never weary of contriving it for your friend’s; and you have made up your mind that a man’s virtue consists in outdoing his friends in kindness and his enemies in mischief; then I think you will find me a useful companion in the quest of good friends," Socrates continued.

811 τί οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος , ἐμοὶ τοῦτο λέγεις , ὥσπερ οὐκ ἐπὶ σοὶ ὂν ὅ τι ἂν βούλῃ περὶ ἐμοῦ λέγειν ;
"Now why do you say this to me? as if you were not free to say what you choose about me," Critobulus asked.

812 μὰ Δί’ οὐχ ὥς ποτε ἐγὼ Ἀσπασίας ἤκουσα ·
"Not so indeed: I can quote Aspasia against you," Socrates replied.

813 ἔφη γὰρ τὰς ἀγαθὰς προμνηστρίδας μετὰ μὲν ἀληθείας τ- ἀγαθὰ διαγγελλούσας δεινὰς εἶναι συνάγειν ἀνθρώπους εἰς κηδείαν , ψευδομένας δ’ οὐκ ἐθέλειν ἐπαινεῖν ·
"She once told me that good matchmakers are successful in making marriages only when the good reports they carry to and fro are true; false reports she would not recommend, for the victims of deception hate one another and the matchmaker too."

814 τοὺς γὰρ ἐξαπατηθέντας ἅμα μισεῖν ἀλλήλους τε καὶ τὴν προμνησαμένην .
"I am convinced that this is sound, and so I think it is not open to me to say anything in your praise that I can’t say truthfully."

815 ἃ δὴ καὶ ἐγὼ πεισθεὶς ὀρθῶς ἔχειν ἡγοῦμαι οὐκ ἐξεῖναί μοι περὶ σοῦ λέγειν ἐπαινοῦντι οὐδὲν ὅ τι ἂν μὴ ἀληθεύω .
"It appears, Socrates, that you are the sort of friend to help me if I am in any way qualified to make friends: but if not, you won’t make up a story to help me," said Critobulus.

816 σὺ μὲν ἄρα , ἔφη ὁ Κριτόβουλος , τοιοῦτός μοι φίλος εἶ , ὦ Σώκρατες , οἷος , ἂν μέν τι αὐτὸς ἔχω ἐπιτήδειον εἰς τὸ φίλους κτήσασθαι , συλλαμβάνειν μοι ·
"How do you think I shall help you best, Critobulus, by false praise, or by urging you to try to be a good man?" Socrates asked.

817 εἰ δὲ μή , οὐκ ἂν ἐθέλοις πλάσας τι εἰπεῖν ἐπὶ τῇ ἐμῇ ὠφελείᾳ .
"It appears, Socrates, that you are the sort of friend to help me if I am in any way qualified to make friends: but if not, you won’t make up a story to help me."

818 πότερα δ’ ἄν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , δοκῶ σοι μᾶλλον ὠφελεῖν σε τὰ ψευδῆ ἐπαινῶν ἢ πείθων πειρᾶσθαί σε ἀγαθὸν ἄνδρα γενέσθαι ;
"How do you think I shall help you best, Critobulus, by false praise, or by urging you to try to be a good man?"

819 εἰ δὲ μὴ φανερὸν οὕτω σοι , ἐκ τῶνδε σκέψαι ·
"If you don’t yet see clearly, take the following cases as illustrations."

820 εἰ γάρ σε βουλόμενος φίλον ποιῆσαι ναυκλήρῳ ψευδόμενος ἐπαινοίην , φάσκων ἀγαθὸν εἶναι κυβερνήτην , ὁ δέ μοι πεισθεὶς ἐπιτρέψειέ σοι τὴν ναῦν μὴ ἐπισταμένῳ κυβερνᾶν , ἔχεις τινὰ ἐλπίδα μὴ ἂν σαυτόν τε καὶ τὴν ναῦν ἀπολέσαι ;
"Suppose that I wanted to get a shipmaster to make you his friend, and as a recommendation told him that you are a good skipper, which is untrue; and suppose that he believed me and put you in charge of his ship in spite of your not knowing how to steer it: have you any reason to hope that you would not lose the ship and your life as well?"

821 ἢ εἴ σοι πείσαιμι κοινῇ τὴν πόλιν ψευδόμενος , ὡς ἂν στρατηγικῷ τε καὶ δικαστικῷ καὶ πολιτικῷ , ἑαυτὴν ἐπιτρέψαι , τί ἂν οἴει σεαυτὸν καὶ τὴν πόλιν ὑπὸ σοῦ παθεῖν ;
"Or suppose that I falsely represented to the Assembly that you are a born general, jurist and statesman in one, and so persuaded the state to commit her fortunes to you, what do you suppose would happen to the state and to yourself under your guidance?"

822 ἢ εἴ τινας ἰδίᾳ τῶν πολιτῶν πείσαιμι ψευδόμενος , ὡς ὄντι οἰκονομικῷ τε καὶ ἐπιμελεῖ , τὰ ἑαυτῶν ἐπιτρέψαι , ἆρ’ οὐκ ἂν πεῖραν διδοὺς ἅμα τε βλαβερὸς εἴης καὶ καταγέλαστος φαίνοιο ;
"Or again, suppose that I falsely described you to certain citizens in private as a thrifty, careful person, and persuaded them to place their affairs in your hands, wouldn’t you do them harm and look ridiculous when you came to the test?"

823 ἀλλὰ συντομωτάτη τε καὶ ἀσφαλεστάτη καὶ καλλίστη ὁδός , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , ὅ τι ἂν βούλῃ δοκεῖν ἀγαθὸς εἶναι , τοῦτο καὶ γενέσθαι ἀγαθὸν πειρᾶσθαι ·
"Nay, Critobulus, if you want to be thought good at anything, you must try to be so; that is the quickest, the surest, the best way."

824 ὅσαι δ’ ἐν ἀνθρώποις ἀρεταὶ λέγονται , σκοπούμενος εὑρήσεις πάσας μαθήσει τε καὶ μελέτῃ αὐξανομένας .
"You will find on reflection that every kind of virtue named among men is increased by study and practice."

825 ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν , ὦ Κριτόβουλε , οἶμαι δεῖν ἡμᾶς G? ·
"Such is the view I take of our duty, Critobulus."

826 εἰ δὲ σύ πως ἄλλως γιγνώσκεις , δίδασκε .
"If you have anything to say against it, tell me."

827 καὶ ὁ Κριτόβουλος , ἀλλ’ αἰσχυνοίμην ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἀντιλέγων τούτοις ·
"Why, Socrates," said Critobulus, "I should be ashamed to contradict you, 

828 οὔτε γὰρ καλὰ οὔτε ἀληθῆ λέγοιμ’ ἄν .
for I should be saying what is neither honourable nor true."

829 καὶ μὴν τὰς ἀπορίας γε τῶν φίλων τὰς μὲν δι’ ἄγνοιαν ἐπειρᾶτο γνώμῃ ἀκεῖσθαι , τὰς δὲ δι’ ἔνδειαν διδάσκων κατὰ δύναμιν ἀλλήλοις ἐπαρκεῖν .
To pass to another subject. The distresses of his friends that arose from ignorance he tried to cure by advice, those that were due to want by telling them how to help one another according to their power.

830 ἐρῶ δὲ καὶ ἐν τούτοις ἃ σύνοιδα αὐτῷ .
On this subject too I will state what I know about him.

831 Ἀρίσταρχον γάρ ποτε ὁρῶν σκυθρωπῶς ἔχοντα , ἔοικας , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀρίσταρχε , βαρέως φέρειν τι .
One day, noticing that Aristarchus looked glum, he said: "Aristarchus, you seem to have a burden on your mind."

832 χρὴ δὲ τοῦ βάρους μεταδιδόναι τοῖς φίλοις ·
"You should let your friends share it;"

833 ἴσως γὰρ ἄν τί σε καὶ ἡμεῖς κουφίσαιμεν .
"possibly we may do something to ease you."

834 καὶ ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος , ἀλλὰ μήν , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἐν πολλῇ γέ εἰμι ἀπορίᾳ .
Ah yes, Socrates, replied Aristarchus, "I am in great distress."

835 ἐπεὶ γὰρ ἐστασίασεν ἡ πόλις , πολλῶν φυγόντων εἰς τὸν Πειραιᾶ , συνεληλύθασιν ὡς ἐμὲ καταλελειμμέναι ἀδελφαί τε καὶ ἀδελφιδαῖ καὶ ἀνεψιαὶ τοσαῦται ὥστ’ εἶναι ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τέτταρας καὶ δέκα τοὺς ἐλευθέρους .
"Since the revolution there has been an exodus to the Piraeus, and a crowd of my women-folk, being left behind, are come to me, — sisters, nieces and cousins, — so that we are fourteen in the house without counting the slaves."

836 λαμβάνομεν δὲ οὔτε ἐκ τῆς γῆς οὐδέν ·
"We get nothing from our land,"

837 οἱ γὰρ ἐναντίοι κρατοῦσιν αὐτῆς ·
"because our enemies have seized it,"

838 οὔτ’ ἀπὸ τῶν οἰκιῶν ·
"and nothing from our house property,"

839 ὀλιγανθρωπία γὰρ ἐν τῷ ἄστει γέγονε .
"now there are so few residents in the city."

840 τὰ ἔπιπλα δὲ οὐδεὶς ὠνεῖται ·
"Portable property finds no buyers,"

841 οὐδὲ δανείσασθαι οὐδαμόθεν ἔστιν ἀργύριον , ἀλλὰ πρότερον ἄν τίς μοι δοκεῖ ἐν τῇ ὁδῷ ζητῶν εὑρεῖν ἢ δανειζόμενος λαβεῖν .
"and it’s quite impossible to borrow money anywhere: I really think a search in the street would have better result than an application for a loan."

842 χαλεπὸν μὲν οὖν ἐστιν , ὦ Σώκρατες , τοὺς οἰκείους περιορᾶν ἀπολλυμένους , ἀδύνατον δὲ τοσούτους τρέφειν ἐν τοιούτοις πράγμασιν .
"It’s hard, Socrates, to let one’s people die, but impossible to keep so many in times like these."

843 ἀκούσας οὖν ταῦτα ὁ Σωκράτης , τί ποτέ ἐστιν , ἔφη , ὅτι Κεράμων μὲν πολλοὺς τρέφων οὐ μόνον ἑαυτῷ τε καὶ τούτοις τὰ ἐπιτήδεια δύναται παρέχειν , ἀλλὰ καὶ περιποιεῖται τοσαῦτα ὥστε καὶ πλουτεῖν , σὺ δὲ πολλοὺς τρέφων δέδοικας μὴ δι’ ἔνδειαν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ἅπαντες ἀπόλησθε ;
"How is it that with so many mouths to feed Ceramon not only contrives to provide for the needs of himself and his family, but actually saves enough to make him a rich man, whereas you, with so many mouths to feed, fear you will all be starved to death?"

844 ὅτι νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὁ μὲν δούλους τρέφει , ἐγὼ δ’ ἐλευθέρους .
"The explanation, of course, is this: my dependants are gentlefolk, his are slaves."

845 καὶ πότερον , ἔφη , τοὺς παρὰ σοὶ ἐλευθέρους οἴει βελτίους εἶναι ἢ τοὺς παρὰ Κεράμωνι δούλους ;
"And which do you think are the better, his slaves or your gentlefolk?"

846 ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι , ἔφη , τοὺς παρ’ ἐμοὶ ἐλευθέρους .
"My gentlefolk, I think."

847 οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , αἰσχρὸν τὸν μὲν ἀπὸ τῶν πονηροτέρων εὐπορεῖν , σὲ δὲ πολλῷ βελτίους ἔχοντα ἐν ἀπορίᾳ εἶναι ;
"Then is it not disgraceful that you with your gentlefolk should be in distress, while he is kept in affluence by his meaner household?"

848 νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὁ μὲν γὰρ τεχνίτας τρέφει , ἐγὼ δ’ ἐλευθερίως πεπαιδευμένους .
"Of course his dependants are artisans, while mine have had a liberal education."

849 ἆρ’ οὖν , ἔφη , τεχνῖταί εἰσιν οἱ χρήσιμόν τι ποιεῖν ἐπιστάμενοι ;
"What is an artisan? one who knows how to produce something useful?"

850 μάλιστά γ’ , ἔφη .
"Certainly."

851 οὐκοῦν χρήσιμά γ’ ἄλφιτα ;
"Are groats useful?"

852 σφόδρα γε .
"Yes, very."

853 τί δ’ ἄρτοι ;
"And bread?"

854 οὐδὲν ἧττον .
"No less so."

855 τί γάρ ;
"What then,"

856 ἔφη , ἱμάτιά τε ἀνδρεῖα καὶ γυναικεῖα καὶ χιτωνίσκοι καὶ χλαμύδες καὶ ἐξωμίδες ;
he said, "What about men’s and women’s cloaks, shirts, capes, smocks?"

857 σφόδρα γ’ , ἔφη , καὶ πάντα ταῦτα χρήσιμα .
"Yes, all these things too are very useful."

858 ἔπειτα , ἔφη , οἱ παρὰ σοὶ τούτων οὐδὲν ἐπίστανται ποιεῖν ;
"Then don’t the members of your household know how to make any of these?"

859	πάντα μὲν οὖν , ὡς ἐγώ- οἶμαι .
"I believe they can make all of them."

860	εἶτ’ οὐκ οἶσθα ὅτι ἀφ’ ἑνὸς μὲν τούτων , ἀλφιτοποιίας , Ναυσικύδης οὐ μόνον ἑαυτόν τε καὶ τοὺς οἰκέτας τρέφει , ἀλλὰ πρὸς τούτοις καὶ ὗς πολλὰς καὶ βοῦς , καὶ περιποιεῖται τοσαῦτα ὥστε καὶ τῇ πόλει πολλάκις λειτουργεῖν , ἀπὸ δὲ ἀρτοποιίας Κύρηβος τήν τε οἰκίαν πᾶσαν διατρέφει καὶ ζῇ δαψιλῶς , Δημέας δ’ ὁ Κολλυτεὺς ἀπὸ χλαμυδουργίας , Μένων δ’ ἀπὸ χλανιδοποιίας , Μεγαρέων δ’ οἱ πλεῖστοι ἀπὸ ἐξωμιδοποιίας διατρέφονται ;

Don’t you know, then, that by manufacturing one of these commodities, namely groats, Nausicydes keeps not only himself and his family, but large herds of swine and cattle as well, and has so much to spare that he often undertakes costly public duties; that Cyrebus feeds his whole family well and lives in luxury by baking bread, Demeas of Collytus by making capes, Menon by making cloaks; and most of the Megarians make a good living out of smocks?

861	νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὗτοι μὲν γὰρ ὠνούμενοι βαρβάρους ἀνθρώπους ἔχουσιν , ὥστ’ ἀναγκάζειν ἐργάζεσθαι ἃ καλῶς ἔχει , ἐγὼ δ’ ἐλευθέρους τε καὶ συγγενεῖς .
Yes, of course; for they buy foreign slaves and can force them to make what is convenient, but my household is made up of gentlefolk and relations.

862	ἔπειτ’ , ἔφη , ὅτι ἐλεύθεροί τ' εἰσὶ καὶ συγγενεῖς σοι , οἴει χρῆναι αὐτοὺς μηδὲν ἄλλο ποιεῖν ἢ ἐσθίειν καὶ καθεύδειν ;

He then said, "Do you think that just because they are free and related to you, they should do nothing else but eat and sleep?

863	πότερον καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἐλευθέρων τοὺς οὕτω ζῶντας ἄμεινον διάγοντας ὁρᾷς καὶ μᾶλλον εὐδαιμονίζεις ἢ τούς , ἃ ἐπίστανται χρήσιμα πρὸς τὸν βίον , τούτων ἐπιμελομένους ;

Do you see whether those other free people who live in this way are better off and happier than those who understand useful things for life, and take care of them?

864	ἢ τὴν μὲν ἀργίαν καὶ τὴν ἀμέλειαν αἰσθάνῃ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις πρός τε τὸ μαθεῖν , ἃ προσήκει ἐπίστασθαι , καὶ πρὸς τὸ μνημονεύειν , ἃ ἂν μάθωσι , καὶ πρὸς τὸ ὑγιαίνειν τε καὶ ἰσχύειν τοῖς σώμασι καὶ πρὸς τὸ κτήσασθαί τε καὶ σῴζειν τὰ χρήσιμα πρὸς τὸν βίον ὠφέλιμα ὄντα , τὴν δ' ἐργασίαν καὶ τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν οὐδὲν χρήσιμα ;

Or does idleness and negligence benefit people when it comes to learning what they ought to know, remembering what they've learned, staying healthy and strong, acquiring and preserving useful things for life? Is work and diligence useless?

865	ἔμαθον δέ , ἃ φὴς αὐτὰς ἐπίστασθαι , πότερον ὡς οὔτε χρήσιμα ὄντα πρὸς τὸν βίον οὔτε ποιήσουσαι αὐτῶν οὐδέν , ἢ τ- ἐναντίον ὡς καὶ ἐπιμελησόμεναι τούτων καὶ ὠφελησόμεναι ἀπ’ αὐτῶν ;

But I have learned that what you say they understand, whether it's as if it's of no use to life, or if they won't do anything with it, or the opposite, if they will take care of it and benefit from it?

866	ποτέρως γὰρ ἂν μᾶλλον ἄνθρωποι σωφρονοῖεν , ἀργοῦντες ἢ τῶν χρησίμων ἐπιμελόμενοι ;

For in which way would people become wiser, by being idle or by taking care of useful things?

867	ποτέρως δ’ ἂν δικαιότεροι εἶεν , εἰ ἐργάζοιντο ἢ εἰ ἀργοῦντες βουλεύοιντο περὶ τῶν ἐπιτηδείων ;

And in which way would they be more just, if they worked or if they engaged in idle discussions about their needs?

868	ἀλλὰ καὶ νῦν μέν , ὡς ἐγώ- οἶμαι , οὔτε σὺ ἐκείνας φιλεῖς οὔτ’ ἐκείναι σέ , σὺ μὲν ἡγούμενος αὐτὰς ἐπιζημίους εἶναι σεαυτῷ , ἐκεῖναι δὲ σὲ ὁρῶσαι ἀχθόμενον ἐφ’ ἑαυταῖς 

But even now, as I think, neither do you love them nor do they love you. You consider them a burden to yourself, and they see you as troubled by them.

869	ἐκ δὲ τούτων κίνδυνος μείζω τε ἀπέχθειαν γίγνεσθαι καὶ τὴν προγεγονυῖαν χάριν μειοῦσθαι .

And from this, there is a greater danger of mutual dislike growing and diminishing the gratitude that existed before.

870	ἐὰν δὲ προστατήσῃς ὅπως ἐνεργοὶ ὦσι , σὺ μὲν ἐκείνας φιλήσεις , ὁρῶν ὠφελίμους σεαυτῷ οὔσας , ἐκεῖναι δὲ σὲ ἀγαπήσουσιν , αἰσθόμεναι χαίροντά σε αὐταῖς , τῶν δὲ προγεγονυιῶν εὐεργεσιῶν ἥδιον μεμνημένοι τὴν ἀπ’ ἐκείνων χάριν αὐξήσετε , καὶ ἐκ τούτων φιλικώτερόν τε καὶ οἰκειότερον ἀλλήλοις ἕξετε .

But if you take charge and ensure that they are active, you will indeed love them, seeing them as beneficial to yourself, and they will love you, feeling pleased with you. By recalling past favors, you will increase the gratitude from those favors, and from this, you will have a more friendly and intimate relationship with each other.

871	εἰ μὲν τοίνυν αἰσχρόν τι ἔμελλον ἐργάσασθαι , θάνατον ἀντ’ αὐτοῦ προαιρετέον ἦν ·

If, therefore, they were about to engage in something disgraceful, they should have chosen death instead.

872	νῦν δὲ ἃ μὲν δοκεῖ κάλλιστα καὶ πρεπωδέστατα γυναικὶ εἶναι ἐπίστανται , ὡς ἔοικε ·

But now, they understand what seems to be the most beautiful and fitting for a woman, it appears.

873	πάντες δὲ ἃ ἐπίστανται ῥᾷστά τε καὶ τάχιστα καὶ κάλλιστα καὶ ἥδιστα ἐργάζονται .

And everyone who understands their work does it with the greatest ease, speed, pride, and pleasure.

874	μὴ οὖν ὄκνει , ἔφη , ταῦτα εἰσηγεῖσθαι αὐταῖς ἃ σοί τε λυσιτελήσει κ- ἐκείναις ·

So do not hesitate, he said, to propose these things to them, which will be beneficial to both you and them.

875	καί , ὡς εἰκός , ἡδέως ὑπακούσονται .

And, as it is likely, they will willingly obey.

876	ἀλλὰ νὴ τοὺς θεούς , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος , οὕτω μοι δοκεῖς καλῶς λέγειν , ὦ Σώκρατες , ὥστε πρόσθεν μὲν οὐ προσιέμην δανείσασθαι , εἰδὼς ὅτι ἀναλώσας ὃ ἂν λάβω οὐχ ἕξω ἀποδοῦναι , νῦν δέ μοι δοκῶ εἰς ἔργων ἀφορμὴν ὑπομενεῖν αὐτὸ ποιῆσαι .

But by the gods, Aristarchus said, you seem to me to speak so well, Socrates, that I now think I should not have hesitated to borrow money before, knowing that I would not have been able to repay what I received. But now, it seems to me that I have a reason to embark on this work.

877	ἐκ τούτων δὲ ἐπορίσθη μὲν ἀφορμή , ἐωνήθη δὲ ἔρια ·

From these words, an opportunity was provided, and quarrels ceased.

878	καὶ ἐργαζόμεναι μὲν ἠρίστων , ἐργασάμεναι δὲ ἐδείπνουν , ἱλαραὶ δὲ ἀντὶ σκυθρωπῶν ἦσαν ·

And while they worked, they were happier, and after working, they had dinner, and they were cheerful instead of being gloomy.

879	καὶ ἀντὶ ὑφορωμένων ἑαυτοὺς ἡδέως ἀλλήλους ἑώρων , καὶ αἱ μὲν ὡς κηδεμόνα ἐφίλουν , ὁ δὲ ὡς ὠφελίμους ἠγάπα .

And instead of looking downcast, they looked at each other with pleasure. And the women loved him as their guardian, and he loved them as being helpful.

880	τέλος δὲ ἐλθὼν πρὸς τὸν Σωκράτην χαίρων διηγεῖτο ταῦτά τε καὶ ὅτι αἰτιῶνται αὐτὸν μόνον τῶν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ ἀργὸν ἐσθίειν 

Finally, he came to Socrates with joy and told him about these things and how they blamed him alone in the household for eating the bread of idleness.

881	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·

And Socrates said:

882	εἶτα οὐ λέγεις αὐταῖς τὸν τοῦ κυνὸς λόγον ;

Then aren't you telling them the story of the dog?

883	φασὶ γάρ , ὅτε φωνήεντα ἦν τὰ ζῷα , τὴν οἶν πρὸς τὸν δεσπότην εἰπεῖν ·

For they say that when animals could speak, a sheep spoke to her master:

884	θαυμαστὸν ποιεῖς , ὃς ἡμῖν μὲν ταῖς καὶ ἔριά σοι καὶ ἄρνας καὶ τυρὸν παρεχούσαις οὐδὲν δίδως ὅ τι ἂν μὴ ἐκ τῆς γῆς λάβωμεν , τῷ δὲ κυνί , ὃς οὐδὲν τοιοῦτόν σοι παρέχει , μεταδίδως οὗπερ αὐτὸς ἔχεις σίτου .

"Do you find it strange that, while you provide us with nothing other than what we obtain from the land, such as wool, lambs, and cheese, you share your food with your dog, who does not provide you with anything like that?"

885	τὸν κύνα οὖν ἀκούσαντα εἰπεῖν ·

Then, upon hearing this, the dog said:

886	ναὶ μὰ Δί’ ·

"Yes, by Zeus,"

887	ἐγὼ γάρ εἰμι ὁ καὶ ὑμᾶς αὐτὰς σῴζων ὥστε μήτε ὑπ’ ἀνθρώπων κλέπτεσθαι μήτε ὑπὸ λύκων ἁρπάζεσθαι ·

"I am the one who saves you, so that you are not stolen by humans or carried off by wolves."

888	ἐπεὶ ὑμεῖς γε , εἰ μὴ ἐγὼ προφυλάττοιμι ὑμᾶς , οὐδ’ ἂν νέμεσθαι δύναισθε , φοβούμεναι μὴ ἀπόλησθε .

"For if it were not for me guarding you, you wouldn't even be able to graze, fearing that you might be lost."

889	οὕτω δὴ λέγεται καὶ τὰ πρόβατα συγχωρῆσαι τὸν κύνα προτιμᾶσθαι .

So, they say, the sheep agreed and preferred the dog.

890	καὶ σὺ οὖν ἐκείναις λέγε ὅτι ἀντὶ κυνὸς εἶ φύλαξ καὶ ἐπιμελητής , καὶ διὰ σὲ οὐδ’ ὑφ’ ἑνὸς ἀδικούμεναι ἀσφαλῶς τε καὶ ἡδέως ἐργαζόμεναι ζῶσιν .

So, you should tell them that you are their guard and caretaker, and because of you, they live and work safely and comfortably, without being wronged by anyone.

891  
ἄλλον δέ ποτε ἀρχαῖον ἑταῖρον διὰ χρόνου ἰδών , πόθεν , ἔφη , Εὔθηρε , φαίνῃ ;  
"Where do you come from, Eutherus?" he said.

892  
ὑπὸ μὲν τὴν κατάλυσιν τοῦ πολέμου , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἐκ τῆς ἀποδημίας , νυνὶ μέντοι αὐτόθεν .  
"I came home when the war ended, Socrates, and am now living here," he replied.

893  
ἐπειδὴ γὰρ ἀφῃρέθημεν τὰ ἐν τῇ ὑπερορίᾳ κτήματα , ἐν δὲ τῇ Ἀττικῇ ὁ πατήρ μοι οὐδὲν κατέλιπεν , ἀναγκάζομαι νῦν ἐπιδημήσας τῷ σώματι ἐργαζόμενος τὰ ἐπιτήδεια πορίζεσθαι .  
"Since we have lost our foreign property, and my father left me nothing in Attica, I am forced to settle down here now and work for my living with my hands. I think it’s better than begging, especially as I have no security to offer for a loan."

894  
δοκεῖ δέ μοι τοῦτο κρεῖττον εἶναι ἢ δεῖσθαί τινος ἀνθρώπων , ἄλλως τε καὶ μηδὲν ἔχοντα ἐφ’ ὅτῳ ἂν δανειζοίμην .  
[Continuation of previous translation]

895  
καὶ πόσον χρόνον οἴει σοι , ἔφη , τὸ σῶμα ἱκανὸν εἶναι μισθοῦ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἐργάζεσθαι ;  
"And how long will you have the strength, do you think, to earn your living by your work?" 

896  
μὰ τὸν Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐ πολὺν χρόνον .  
"Oh, not long, of course."

897  
καὶ μήν , ἔφη , ὅταν γε πρεσβύτερος γένῃ , δῆλον ὅτι δαπάνης μὲν δεήσῃ , μισθὸν δὲ οὐδείς σοι θελήσει τῶν τοῦ σώματος ἔργων διδόναι .  
"But remember, when you get old you will have to spend money, and nobody will be willing to pay you for your labor."

898  
ἀληθῆ λέγεις , ἔφη .  
"True."

899  
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , κρεῖττόν ἐστιν αὐτόθεν τοῖς τοιούτοις τῶν ἔργων ἐπιτίθεσθαι , ἃ καὶ πρεσβυτέρῳ γενομένῳ ἐπαρκέσει , καὶ προσελθόντα τῳ τῶν πλείω χρήματα κεκτημένων , τῷ δεομένῳ τοῦ συνεπιμελησομένου , ἔργων τε ἐπιστατοῦντα καὶ συγκομίζοντα τοὺς καρποὺς καὶ συμφυλάττοντα τὴν οὐσίαν , ὠφελοῦντα ἀντωφελεῖσθαι .  
"Then it would be better to take up some kind of work at once that will assure you a competence when you get old, and to go to somebody who is better off and wants an assistant, and get a return for your services by acting as his bailiff, helping to get in his crops and looking after his property."

900. χαλεπῶς ἄν, ἔφη, ἐγώ, ὦ Σώκρατες, δουλείαν ὑπομείναιμι.
Translation:
I shouldn't like to make myself a slave, said Socrates.
901. καὶ μὴν οἵ γε ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι προστατεύοντες καὶ τῶν δημοσίων ἐπιμελούμενοι οὐ δουλοπρεπέστεροι ἕνεκα τούτου, ἀλλ’ ἐλευθεριώτεροι νομίζονται.
Translation:
But surely those who control their cities and take charge of public affairs are thought more respectable, not more slavish on that account.
902. ὅλως, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, τὸ ὑπαίτιον εἶναί τινι οὐ πάνυ προσίεμαι.
Translation:
Briefly, Socrates, I have no inclination to expose myself to any man's censure.
903. καὶ μήν, ἔφη, Εὔθηρε, οὐ πάνυ γε ῥᾴδιόν ἐστιν εὑρεῖν ἔργον ἐφ’ ᾧ οὐκ ἄν τις αἰτίαν ἔχοι.
Translation:
But, you see, Eutherus, it is by no means easy to find a post in which one is not liable to censure. 
904. χαλεπὸν γὰρ οὕτω τι ποιῆσαι ὥστε μηδὲν ἁμαρτεῖν, χαλεπὸν δὲ καὶ ἀναμαρτήτως τι ποιήσαντα μὴ ἀγνώμονι κριτῇ περιτυχεῖν.
Translation:
Whatever one does, it is difficult to avoid mistakes, and it is difficult to escape unfair criticism even if one makes no mistakes.

905
ἐπεὶ καὶ οἷς νῦν ἐργάζεσθαι φῂς θαυμάζω εἰ ῥᾴδιόν ἐστιν ἀνέγκλητον διαγίγνεσθαι .
"I wonder if you find it easy to avoid complaints entirely even from your present employers."

906
χρὴ οὖν πειρᾶσθαι τοὺς φιλαιτίους φεύγειν καὶ τοὺς εὐγνώμονας διώκειν , καὶ τῶν πραγμάτων ὅσα μὲν δύνασαι ποιεῖν ὑπομένειν , ὅσα δὲ μὴ δύνασαι φυλάττεσθαι , ὅ τι δ’ ἂν πράττῃς , τούτου ὡς κάλλιστα καὶ προθυμότατα ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .
"You should try, therefore, to have no truck with grumblers and to attach yourself to considerate masters; to undertake such duties as you can perform and beware of any that are too much for you, and, whatever you do, to give of your best and put your heart into the business."

907
οὕτω γὰρ ἥκιστ’ ἂν μέν σε οἶμαι ἐν αἰτίᾳ εἶναι , μάλιστα δὲ τῇ ἀπορίᾳ βοήθειαν εὑρεῖν , ῥᾷστα δὲ καὶ ἀκινδυνότατα ζῆν καὶ εἰς τὸ γῆρας διαρκέστατα .
"In this way, I think, you are most likely to escape censure, find relief from your difficulties, live in ease and security, and obtain an ample competence for old age."

908  
οἶδα δέ ποτε αὐτὸν καὶ Κρίτωνος ἀκούσαντα , ὡς χαλεπὸν ὁ βίος Ἀθήνησιν εἴη ἀνδρὶ βουλομένῳ τὰ ἑαυτοῦ πράττειν .  
I remember that he once heard Criton say that life at Athens was difficult for a man who wanted to mind his own business.

909  
νῦν γάρ , ἔφη , ἐμέ τινες εἰς δίκας ἄγουσιν , οὐχ ὅτι ἀδικοῦνται ὑπ’ ἐμοῦ , ἀλλ’ ὅτι νομίζουσιν ἥδιον ἄν με ἀργύριον τελέσαι ἢ πράγματα ἔχειν .  
"At this moment," Criton added, "actions are pending against me not because I have done the plaintiffs an injury, but because they think that I would sooner pay than have trouble."

910  
καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης , εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Κρίτων , κύνας δὲ τρέφεις , ἵνα σοι τοὺς λύκους ἀπὸ τῶν προβάτων ἀπερύκωσι ;  
"Tell me, Criton," said Socrates, "do you keep dogs to fend the wolves from your sheep?"

911  
καὶ μάλα , ἔφη ·  
"Certainly," replied Criton,

912  
μᾶλλον γάρ μοι λυσιτελεῖ τρέφειν ἢ μή .  
"because it pays me better to keep them."

913  
οὐκ ἂν οὖν θρέψαις καὶ ἄνδρα , ὅστις ἐθέλοι τε καὶ δύναιτο σοῦ ἀπερύκειν τοὺς ἐπιχειροῦντας ἀδικεῖν σε ;  
"Then why not keep a man who may be able and willing to fend off the attempts to injure you?"

914  
ἡδέως γ’ ἄν , ἔφη , εἰ μὴ φοβοίμην ὅπως μὴ ἐπ’ αὐτόν με τράποιτο .  
"I would gladly do so were I not afraid that he might turn on me."

915  
τί δ’ ;  
"What?"

916  
ἔφη , οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι πολλῷ ἥδιόν ἐστι χαριζόμενον οἵῳ σοὶ ἀνδρὶ ἢ ἀπεχθόμενον ὠφελεῖσθαι ;  
"Don’t you see that it is much pleasanter to profit by humouring a man like you than by quarrelling with him?"

917  
εὖ ἴσθι ὅτι εἰσὶν ἐνθάδε τῶν τοιούτων ἀνδρῶν , οἳ πάνυ ἂν φιλοτιμηθεῖεν φίλῳ σοι χρῆσθαι .  
"I assure you there are men in this city who would take pride in your friendship.

918  
καὶ ἐκ τούτων ἀνευρίσκουσιν Ἀρχέδημον , πάνυ μὲν ἱκανὸν εἰπεῖν τε καὶ πρᾶξαι , πένητα δέ ·  
Thereupon they sought out Archedemus, an excellent speaker and man of affairs, but poor.

919  
οὐ γὰρ ἦν οἷος ἀπὸ παντὸς κερδαίνειν , ἀλλὰ φιλόχρηστός τε καὶ ἔφη ῥᾷστον εἶναι ἀπὸ τῶν συκοφαντῶν λαμβάνειν .  
For he was not one of those who make money unscrupulously, but an honest man, and he would say that it was easy to take forfeit from false accusers.

920  
τούτῳ οὖν ὁ Κρίτων , ὁπότε συγκομίζοι ἢ σῖτον ἢ ἔλαιον ἢ οἶνον ἢ ἔρια ἤ τι ἄλλο τῶν ἐν ἀγρῷ γιγνομένων χρησίμων πρὸς τὸν βίον , ἀφελὼν ἂν ἔδωκε ·  
So whenever Criton was storing corn, oil, wine, wool, or other farm produce, he would make a present of a portion to Archedemus.

921  
καὶ ὁπότε θύοι , ἐκάλει , καὶ τὰ τοιαῦτα πάντα ἐπεμελεῖτο .  
And when he sacrificed, he invited him, and in fact lost no similar opportunity of showing courtesy.

922  
νομίσας δὲ ὁ Ἀρχέδημος ἀποστροφήν οἱ τὸν Κρίτωνος οἶκον μάλα περιεῖπεν αὐτόν .  
Archedemus came to regard Criton’s house as a haven of refuge and constantly paid his respects to him.

923  
καὶ εὐθὺς τῶν συκοφαντούντων τὸν Κρίτωνα ἀνευρίσκει πολλὰ μὲν ἀδικήματα , πολλοὺς δ’ ἐχθρούς ·  
He soon found out that Criton’s false accusers had much to answer for and many enemies.

924  
καὶ προσεκαλέσατο εἰς δίκην δημοσίαν , ἐν ᾗ αὐτὸν ἔδει κριθῆναι ὅ τι δεῖ παθεῖν ἢ ἀποτεῖσαι .  
He brought one of them to trial on a charge involving damages or imprisonment.

925  
ὁ δὲ συνειδὼς αὑτῷ πολλὰ καὶ πονηρὰ πάντ’ ἐποίει ὥστε ἀπαλλαγῆναι τοῦ Ἀρχεδήμου .  
The defendant, conscious that he was guilty on many counts, did all he could to get quit of Archedemus.

926  
ὁ δὲ Ἀρχέδημος οὐκ ἀπηλλάττετο , ἕως τόν τε Κρίτωνα ἀφῆκε καὶ αὐτῷ χρήματα ἔδωκεν .  
But Archedemus refused to let him off until he withdrew the action against Criton and compensated him.

927  
ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦτό τε καὶ ἄλλα τοιαῦτα ὁ Ἀρχέδημος διεπράξατο , ἤδη τότε , ὥσπερ ὅταν νομεὺς ἀγαθὸν κύνα ἔχῃ καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι νομεῖς βούλονται πλησίον αὐτοῦ τὰς ἀγέλας ἱστάναι , ἵνα τοῦ κυνὸς ἀπολαύωσιν , οὕτω δὴ καὶ Κρίτωνος πολλοὶ τῶν φίλων ἐδέοντο καὶ σφίσι παρέχειν φύλακα τὸν Ἀρχέδημον .  
Archedemus carried through several other enterprises of a similar kind; and now many of Criton’s friends begged him to make Archedemus their protector, just as when a shepherd has a good dog the other shepherds want to pen their flocks near his, in order to get the use of his dog.

928  
ὁ δὲ Ἀρχέδημος τῷ Κρίτωνι ἡδέως ἐχαρίζετο , καὶ οὐχ ὅτι μόνος ὁ Κρίτων ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ ἦν , ἀλλὰ καὶ οἱ φίλοι αὐτοῦ .  
Archedemus was glad to humour Criton, and so there was peace not only for Criton but for his friends as well.

929  
εἰ δέ τις αὐτῷ τούτων οἷς ἀπήχθετο ὀνειδίζοι ὡς ὑπὸ Κρίτωνος ὠφελούμενος κολακεύοι αὐτόν , πότερον οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρχέδημος , αἰσχρόν ἐστιν εὐεργετούμενον ὑπὸ χρηστῶν ἀνθρώπων καὶ ἀντευεργετοῦντα τοὺς μὲν τοιούτους φίλους ποιεῖσθαι , τοῖς δὲ πονηροῖς διαφέρεσθαι , ἢ τοὺς μὲν καλοὺς κ- ἀγαθοὺς ἀδικεῖν πειρώμενον ἐχθροὺς ποιεῖσθαι , τοῖς δὲ πονηροῖς συνεργοῦντα πειρᾶσθαι φίλους ποιεῖσθαι καὶ χρῆσθαι τούτοις ἀντ’ ἐκείνων ;  
If anyone whom he had offended reproached Archedemus with flattering Criton because he found him useful, he would answer, "Which, then, is disgraceful: to have honest men for your friends, by accepting and returning their favours, and to fall out with rogues; or to treat gentlemen as enemies by trying to injure them, and to make friends of rogues by siding with them, and to prefer their intimacy?"

930  
ἐκ δὲ τούτου εἷς τε τῶν Κρίτωνος φίλων Ἀρχέδημος ἦν καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων Κρίτωνος φίλων ἐτιμᾶτο .  
Henceforward Archedemus was respected by Criton’s friends and was himself numbered among them.

931  
οἶδα δὲ καὶ Διοδώρῳ αὐτὸν ἑταίρῳ ὄντι τοιάδε διαλεχθέντα ·  
Again I recall the following conversation between him and his companion Diodorus.

932  
εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Διόδωρε , ἄν τίς σοι τῶν οἰκετῶν ἀποδρᾷ , ἐπιμελῇ , ὅπως ἀνασώσῃ ;  
"Tell me, Diodorus," he said, "if one of your servants runs away, do you take steps to bring him back safe?"

933  
καὶ ἄλλους γε νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , παρακαλῶ , σῶστρα τούτου ἀνακηρύττων .  
"Certainly," he replied, "and I ask others to help in the search."

933  
καὶ ἄλλους γε νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , παρακαλῶ , σῶστρα τούτου ἀνακηρύττων .  
"Yes, of course," he replied, "and I invite others to help, by offering a reward for the recovery of the man."

934  
τί γάρ ;  
"And further,"

935  
ἔφη , ἐάν τίς σοι κάμνῃ τῶν οἰκετῶν , τούτου ἐπιμελῇ καὶ παρακαλεῖς ἰατρούς , ὅπως μὴ ἀποθάνῃ ;  
"if one of your servants is ill, do you take care of him and call in doctors to prevent him dying?"

936  
σφόδρα γ’ , ἔφη .  
"Indeed I do."

937  
εἰ δέ τίς σοι τῶν γνωρίμων , ἔφη , πολὺ τῶν οἰκετῶν χρησιμώτερος ὢν κινδυνεύει δι’ ἔνδειαν ἀπολέσθαι , οὐκ οἴει σοι ἄξιον εἶναι ἐπιμεληθῆναι ὅπως διασωθῇ ;  
"Well, suppose that one of your acquaintances, who is much more useful than your servants, is near being ruined by want, don’t you think it worth your while to take steps to save him?"

938  
καὶ μὴν οἶσθά γε ὅτι οὐκ ἀγνώμων ἐστὶν Ἑρμογένης , αἰσχύνοιτο δ’ ἄν , εἰ ὠφελούμενος ὑπὸ σοῦ μὴ ἀντωφελοίη σε ·  
"Now you know that Hermogenes is a conscientious man and would be ashamed to take a favour from you without making a return."

939  
καίτοι τὸ ὑπηρέτην ἑκόντα τε καὶ εὔνουν καὶ παραμόνιμον καὶ τὸ κελευόμενον ἱκανὸν ποιεῖν ἔχειν , καὶ μὴ μόνον τὸ κελευόμενον ἱκανὸν ὄντα ποιεῖν , ἀλλὰ δυνάμενον καὶ ἀφ’ ἑαυτοῦ χρήσιμον εἶναι καὶ προνοεῖν καὶ προβουλεύεσθαι πολλῶν οἰκετῶν οἶμαι ἀντάξιον εἶναι .  
"Yet surely it is worth many servants to have a willing, loyal, staunch subordinate, capable of doing what he is told, and not only so, but able to make himself useful unbidden, to think clearly and give advice."

940  
οἱ μέντοι ἀγαθοὶ οἰκονόμοι , ὅταν τὸ πολλοῦ ἄξιον μικροῦ ἐξῇ πρίασθαι , τότε φασὶ δεῖν ὠνεῖσθαι ·  
"Good householders, you know, say that the right time to buy is when a valuable article can be bought at a low price;"

941  
νῦν δὲ διὰ τὰ πράγματα εὐωνοτάτους ἔστι φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσασθαι .  
"and in these times the circumstances afford an opportunity of acquiring good friends very cheap."

942  
καὶ ὁ Διόδωρος , ἀλλὰ καλῶς γε , ἔφη , λέγεις , ὦ Σώκρατες , καὶ κέλευσον ἐλθεῖν ὡς ἐμὲ τὸν Ἑρμογένην .  
"Thank you, Socrates," said Diodorus, "pray bid Hermogenes call on me."

943  
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἔγωγε ·  
"No, indeed I won’t," said he;

944  
νομίζω γὰρ οὔτε σοὶ κάλλιον εἶναι τὸ καλέσαι ἐκεῖνον τοῦ αὐτὸν ἐλθεῖν πρὸς ἐκεῖνον οὔτ’ ἐκείνῳ μεῖζον ἀγαθὸν τὸ πραχθῆναι ταῦτα ἢ σοί .  
"for in my opinion it is at least as good for you to go to him yourself as to invite him to come to you, and you have quite as much to gain as he by doing so."

945  
οὕτω δὴ ὁ Διόδωρος ᾤχετο πρὸς τὸν Ἑρμογένην ·  
The consequence was that Diodorus set off to visit Hermogenes;

946  
καὶ οὐ πολὺ τελέσας ἐκτήσατο φίλον , ὃς ἔργον εἶχε σκοπεῖν ὅ τι ἂν ἢ λέγων ἢ πράττων ὠφελοίη τε καὶ εὐφραίνοι Διόδωρον .  
and in return for a small sum he acquired a friend who made a point of thinking how he could help and please him either by word or deed.

947  
ὅτι δὲ τοὺς ὀρεγομένους τῶν καλῶν ἐπιμελεῖς ὧν ὀρέγοιντο ποιῶν ὠφέλει , νῦν τοῦτο διηγήσομαι .  
I will now explain how he helped those who were eager to win distinction by making them qualify themselves for the honours they coveted.

948  
ἀκούσας γάρ ποτε Διονυσόδωρον εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἥκειν ἐπαγγελλόμενον στρατηγεῖν διδάξειν , ἔλεξε πρός τινα τῶν συνόντων , ὃν ᾐσθάνετο βουλόμενον τῆς τιμῆς ταύτης ἐν τῇ πόλει τυχεῖν ·  
He once heard that Dionysodorus had arrived at Athens, and gave out that he was going to teach generalship. Being aware that one of his companions wished to obtain the office of general from the state, he addressed him thus:


949  
αἰσχρὸν μέντοι , ὦ νεανία , τὸν βουλόμενον ἐν τῇ πόλει στρατηγεῖν , ἐξὸν τοῦτο μαθεῖν , ἀμελῆσαι αὐτοῦ ·  
"Young man, surely it would be disgraceful for one who wishes to be a general in the state to neglect the opportunity of learning the duties,"

950  
καὶ δικαίως ἂν οὗτος ὑπὸ τῆς πόλεως ζημιοῖτο πολὺ μᾶλλον ἢ εἴ τις ἀνδριάντας ἐργολαβοίη μὴ μεμαθηκὼς ἀνδριαντοποιεῖν .  
"and he would deserve to be punished by the state much more than one who carved statues without having learned to be a sculptor."

951  
ὅλης γὰρ τῆς πόλεως ἐν τοῖς πολεμικοῖς κινδύνοις ἐπιτρεπομένης τῷ στρατηγῷ , μεγάλα τά τε ἀγαθὰ κατορθοῦντος αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ κακὰ διαμαρτάνοντος εἰκὸς γίγνεσθαι .  
"For in the dangerous times of war the whole state is in the general’s hands, and great good may come from his success and great evil from his failure."

952  
πῶς οὖν οὐκ ἂν δικαίως ὁ τοῦ μὲν μανθάνειν τοῦτο ἀμελῶν , τοῦ δὲ αἱρεθῆναι ἐπιμελόμενος ζημιοῖτο ;  
"Therefore anyone who exerts himself to gain the votes, but neglects to learn the business, deserves punishment."

953  
τοιαῦτα μὲν δὴ λέγων ἔπεισεν αὐτὸν ἐλθόντα μανθάνειν .  
"This speech persuaded the man to go and learn."

954  
ἐπεὶ δὲ μεμαθηκὼς ἧκε , προσέπαιζεν αὐτῷ λέγων ·  
"When he had learnt his lesson and returned, Socrates chaffed him."

955  
οὐ δοκεῖ ὑμῖν , ὦ ἄνδρες , ὥσπερ Ὅμηρος τὸν Ἀγαμέμνονα γεραρὸν ἔφη εἶναι , οὕτω καὶ ὅδε στρατηγεῖν μαθὼν γεραρώτερος φαίνεσθαι ;  
"Don’t you think, sirs," he said, "that our friend looks more 'majestic,' as Homer called Agamemnon, now that he has learnt generalship?"

956  
καὶ γάρ , ὥσπερ ὁ κιθαρίζε

ιν μαθών , καὶ ἐὰν μὴ κιθαρίζῃ , κιθαριστής ἐστι , καὶ ὁ μαθὼν ἰᾶσθαι , κἂν μὴ ἰατρεύῃ , ὅμως ἰατρός ἐστιν , οὕτω καὶ ὅδε ἀπὸ τοῦδε τοῦ χρόνου διατελεῖ στρατηγὸς ὤν , κἂν μηδεὶς αὐτὸν ἕληται .  
"For just as he who has learnt to play the harp is a harper even when he doesn’t play, and he who has studied medicine is a doctor even though he doesn’t practise, so our friend will be a general for ever, even if no one votes for him."

957  
ὁ δὲ μὴ ἐπιστάμενος οὔτε στρατηγὸς οὔτε ἰατρός ἐστιν , οὐδ’ ἐὰν ὑπὸ πάντων ἀνθρώπων αἱρεθῇ .  
"But your ignoramus is neither general nor doctor, even if he gets every vote."

958  
ἀτάρ , ἔφη , ἵνα καί , ἐὰν ἡμῶν τις ἢ ταξιαρχῇ ἢ λοχαγῇ σοι , ἐπιστημονέστεροι τῶν πολεμικῶν ὦμεν , λέξον ἡμῖν πόθεν ἤρξατό σε διδάσκειν τὴν στρατηγίαν .  
"But," he continued, "in order that any one of us who may happen to command a regiment or platoon under you may have a better knowledge of warfare, tell us the first lesson he gave you in generalship."

959  
καὶ ὅς , ἐκ τοῦ αὐτοῦ , ἔφη , εἰς ὅπερ καὶ ἐτελεύτα ·  
"The first was like the last," he replied; "he taught me tactics — nothing else."

960  
τὰ γὰρ τακτικὰ ἐμέ γε καὶ ἄλλ’ οὐδὲν ἐδίδαξεν .  
"He taught me tactics and nothing else."

961  
ἀλλὰ μήν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , τοῦτό γε πολλοστὸν μέρος ἐστὶ στρατηγίας .  
"But then that is only a small part of generalship," Socrates said.

962  
καὶ γὰρ παρασκευαστικὸν τῶν εἰς τὸν πόλεμον τὸν στρατηγὸν εἶναι χρή , καὶ ποριστικὸν τῶν ἐπιτηδείων τοῖς στρατιώταις , καὶ μηχανικὸν καὶ ἐργαστικὸν καὶ ἐπιμελῆ καὶ καρτερικὸν καὶ ἀγχίνουν , καὶ φιλόφρονά τε καὶ ὠμόν , καὶ ἁπλοῦν τε καὶ ἐπίβουλον , καὶ φυλακτικόν τε καὶ κλέπτην , καὶ προετικὸν καὶ ἅρπαγα καὶ φιλόδωρον καὶ πλεονέκτην καὶ ἀσφαλῆ καὶ ἐπιθετικόν , καὶ ἄλλα πολλὰ καὶ φύσει καὶ ἐπιστήμῃ δεῖ τὸν εὖ στρατηγήσοντα ἔχειν .  
"For a general must also be capable of furnishing military equipment and providing supplies for the men; he must be resourceful, active, careful, hardy and quick-witted; he must be both gentle and brutal, at once straightforward and designing, capable of both caution and surprise, lavish and rapacious, generous and mean, skilful in defence and attack; and there are many other qualifications, some natural, some acquired, that are necessary to one who would succeed as a general."

963  
καλὸν δὲ καὶ τὸ τακτικὸν εἶναι ·  
"It is well to understand tactics too;"

964  
πολὺ γὰρ διαφέρει στράτευμα τεταγμένον ἀτάκτου , ὥσπερ λίθοι τε καὶ πλίνθοι καὶ ξύλα καὶ κέραμος ἀτάκτως μὲν ἐρριμμένα οὐδὲν χρήσιμά ἐστιν , ἐπειδὰν δὲ ταχθῇ κάτω μὲν καὶ ἐπιπολῆς τὰ μήτε σηπόμενα μήτε τηκόμενα , οἵ τε λίθοι καὶ ὁ κέραμος , ἐν μέσῳ δὲ αἵ τε πλίνθοι καὶ τὰ ξύλα , ὥσπερ ἐν οἰκοδομίᾳ συντίθεται , τότε γίγνεται πολλοῦ ἄξιον κτῆμα , οἰκία .  
"for there is a wide difference between right and wrong disposition of the troops, just as stones, bricks, timber, and tiles flung together anyhow are useless, whereas when the materials that neither rot nor decay, that is, the stones and tiles, are placed at the bottom and the top, and the bricks and timber are put together in the middle, as in building, the result is something of great value, a house, in fact."

965  
ἀλλὰ πάνυ , ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος , ὅμοιον , ὦ Σώκρατες , εἴρηκας .  
"Your analogy is perfect, Socrates," said the youth.

966  
καὶ γὰρ ἐν τῷ πολέμῳ τοὺς ἀρίστους δεῖ πρώτους τάττειν καὶ τελευταίους , ἐν μέσῳ δὲ τοὺς χειρίστους , ἵνα ὑπὸ μὲν τῶν ἄγωνται , ὑπὸ δὲ τῶν ὠθῶνται .  
"For in war one must put the best men in the van and the rear, and the worst in the centre, that they may be led by the van and driven forward by the rearguard."

967  
εἰ μὲν τοίνυν , ἔφη , καὶ διαγιγνώσκειν σε τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς καὶ τοὺς κακοὺς ἐδίδαξεν ·  
"Well and good, provided that he taught you also to distinguish the good and the bad men."

968  
εἰ δὲ μή , τί σοι ὄφελος ὧν ἔμαθες ;  
"If not, what have you gained by your lessons?"

969  
οὐδὲ γὰρ εἴ σε ἀργύριον ἐκέλευσε πρῶτον μὲν καὶ τελευταῖον τὸ κάλλιστον τάττειν , ἐν μέσῳ δὲ τὸ χείριστον , μὴ διδάξας διαγιγνώσκειν τό τε καλὸν καὶ τὸ κίβδηλον , οὐδὲν ἄν σοι ὄφελος ἦν .  
"No more than you would have gained if he had ordered you to put the best money at the head and tail, and the worst in the middle, without telling you how to distinguish good from base coin."

970  
ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐκ ἐδίδαξεν ·  
"I assure you he didn’t,"

971  
ὥστε αὐτοὺς ἂν ἡμᾶς δέοι τούς τε ἀγαθοὺς καὶ τοὺς κακοὺς κρίνειν .  
"so we should have to judge for ourselves which are the good men and which are the bad."

972  
τί οὖν οὐ σκοποῦμεν , ἔφη , πῶς ἂν αὐτῶν μὴ διαμαρτάνοιμεν ;  
"Then we had better consider how we may avoid mistaking them."

973  
βούλομαι , ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος .  
"I want to do so," said the youth.

974  
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , εἰ μὲν ἀργύριον δέοι ἁρπάζειν , τοὺς φιλαργυρωτάτους πρώτους καθιστάντες ὀρθῶς ἂν τάττοιμεν ;  
"Well now," said Socrates, "if we had to lay hands on a sum of money, would not the right arrangement be to put the most covetous men in the front?"

975  
ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ .  
"I think so."

976  
τί δὲ τοὺς κινδυνεύειν μέλλοντας ;  
"And what should we do with those who are going to face danger?"

977  
ἆρα τοὺς φιλοτιμοτάτους προτακτέον ;  
"Should our first line consist of the most ambitious?"

978  
οὗτοι γοῦν εἰσιν , ἔφη , οἱ ἕνεκα ἐπαίνου κινδυνεύειν ἐθέλοντες .  
"Oh yes: they are the men who will face danger for the sake of glory."

979  
οὐ τοίνυν οὗτοί γε ἄδηλοι , ἀλλ’ ἐπιφανεῖς πανταχοῦ ὄντες εὐαίρετοι ἂν εἶεν .  
"About these, now, there is no mystery: they are conspicuous everywhere, and so it is easy to find them."

980  
ἀτάρ , ἔφη , πότερά σε τάττειν μόνον ἐδίδαξεν , ἢ καὶ ὅπῃ καὶ ὅπως χρηστέον ἑκάστῳ τῶν ταγμάτων ;  
"But," said Socrates, "did he teach you only the disposition of an army, or did he include where and how to use each formation?"

981  
οὐ πάνυ , ἔφη .  
"Not at all," he replied.

982  
καὶ μὴν πολλά γ’ ἐστὶ πρὸς ἃ οὔτε τάττειν οὔτε ἄγειν ὡσαύτως προσήκει .  
"And yet there are many situations that call for a modification of tactics and strategy."

983  
ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , οὐ διεσαφήνιζε ταῦτα .  
"I assure you he didn’t explain that."

984  
νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , πάλιν τοίνυν ἐλθὼν ἐπανερώτα ·  
"Then pray go back and ask him."

985  
ἂν γὰρ ἐπίστηται καὶ μὴ ἀναιδὴς ᾖ , αἰσχυνεῖται ἀργύριον εἰληφὼς ἐνδεᾶ σε ἀποπέμψασθαι .  
"If he knows and has a conscience, he will be ashamed to send you home ill-taught, after taking your money."

986  
ἐντυχὼν δέ ποτε στρατηγεῖν ᾑρημένῳ τῳ , τοῦ ἕνεκεν , ἔφη , Ὅμηρον οἴει τὸν Ἀγαμέμνονα προσαγορεῦσαι ποιμένα λαῶν ;  
"One day when he met a man who had been chosen general, he asked him, 'For what reason, think you, is Agamemnon dubbed 'Shepherd of the people' by Homer?"

987  
ἆρά γε ὅτι , ὥσπερ τὸν ποιμένα δεῖ ἐπιμελεῖσθαι , ὅπως σῶαί τε ἔσονται αἱ οἶες καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἕξουσι καί , οὗ ἕνεκα τρέφονται , τοῦτο ἔσται , οὕτω καὶ τὸν στρατηγὸν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι δεῖ , ὅπως σῶοί τε οἱ στρατιῶται ἔσονται καὶ τὰ ἐπιτήδεια ἕξουσι καί , οὗ ἕνεκα στρατεύονται , τοῦτο ἔσται ;  
"Is it because a shepherd must see that his sheep are safe and are fed, and that the object for which they are kept is attained, and a general must see that his men are safe and are fed, and that the object for which they fight is attained, or, in other words, that victory over the enemy may add to their happiness?"

988  
στρατεύονται δέ , ἵνα κρατοῦντες τῶν πολεμίων εὐδαιμονέστεροι ὦσιν .  
"They fight, indeed, to be more prosperous by overcoming the enemies."

989  
ἢ τί δήποτε οὕτως ἐπῄνεσε τὸν Ἀγαμέμνονα εἰπών ·  
"Or what reason can Homer have for praising Agamemnon by saying:"

990  
ἀμφότερον , βασιλεύς τ’ ἀγαθὸς κρατερός τ’ αἰχμητής ;  
"'both a good king and a doughty warrior too'?"

991  
ἆρά γε ὅτι αἰχμητής τε κρατερὸς ἂν εἴη , οὐκ εἰ μόνος αὐτὸς εὖ ἀγωνίζοιτο πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους , ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ παντὶ τῷ στρατοπέδῳ τούτου αἴτιος εἴη , καὶ βασιλεὺς ἀγαθός , οὐκ εἰ μόνον τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ βίου καλῶς προεστήκοι , ἀλλ’ εἰ καί , ὧν βασιλεύοι , τούτοις εὐδαιμονίας αἴτιος εἴη ;  
"Is it because he would be 'a doughty warrior too' not if he alone were a good fighter, but if he made all his men like himself; and 'a good king' not if he merely ordered his own life aright, but if he made his subjects happy as well?"

992  
καὶ γὰρ βασιλεὺς αἱρεῖται οὐχ ἵνα ἑαυτοῦ καλῶς ἐπιμελῆται , ἀλλ’ ἵνα καὶ οἱ ἑλόμενοι δι’ αὐτὸν εὖ πράττωσι ·  
"Because a king is chosen, not to take good care of himself, but for the good of those who have chosen him;"

993  
καὶ στρατεύονται δὲ πάντες , ἵνα ὁ βίος αὐτοῖς ὡς βέλτιστος ᾖ , καὶ στρατηγοὺς αἱροῦνται τούτου ἕνεκα , ἵνα πρὸς τοῦτο αὐτοῖς ἡγεμόνες ὦσι .  
"and all men fight in order that they may get the best life possible, and choose generals to guide them to it."

994  
δεῖ οὖν τὸν στρατηγοῦντα τοῦτο παρασκευάζειν τοῖς ἑλομένοις αὐτὸν στρατηγόν ·  
"Therefore it is the duty of a commander to contrive this for those who have chosen him for general."

995  
καὶ γὰρ οὔτε κάλλιον τούτου ἄλλο ῥᾴδιον εὑρεῖν οὔτε αἴσχιον τοῦ ἐναντίου .  
"For anything more honourable than that is not easy to find, or anything more disgraceful than its opposite."

996  
καὶ οὕτως ἐπισκοπῶν τίς εἴη ἀγαθοῦ ἡγεμόνος ἀρετὴ τὰ μὲν ἄλλα περιῄρει , κατέλιπε δὲ τὸ εὐδαίμονας ποιεῖν ὧν ἂν ἡγῆται .  
"By these reflections on what constitutes a good leader he stripped away all other virtues, and left just the power to make his followers happy."

997  
καὶ ἱππαρχεῖν δέ τινι ᾑρημένῳ οἶδά ποτε αὐτὸν τοιάδε διαλεχθέντα ·  
"Again, when someone had been chosen a leader of cavalry, I remember that Socrates conversed with him in the following manner:"

998  
ἔχοις ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ νεανία , εἰπεῖν ἡμῖν ὅτου ἕνεκα ἐπεθύμησας ἱππαρχεῖν ;  
"Young man," he said, "can you tell us why you hankered after a cavalry command?"

999  
οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦ πρῶτος τῶν ἱππέων ἐλαύνειν ·  
"I presume it was not to be first of the cavalry in the charge;"

1000  
καὶ γὰρ οἱ ἱπποτοξόται τούτου γε ἀξιοῦνται ·  
"for that privilege belongs to the mounted archers;"

1001  
προελαύνουσι γοῦν καὶ τῶν ἱππάρχων .  
"at any rate they ride ahead of their commanders even."

1002  
ἀληθῆ λέγεις , ἔφη .  
"True," he replied.

1003  
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ τοῦ γνωσθῆναί γε ·  
"Nor was it to get yourself known either."

1004  
ἐπεὶ καὶ οἱ μαινόμενοί γε ὑπὸ πάντων γιγνώσκονται .  
"Even madmen are known to everyone."

1005  
ἀληθές , ἔφη , καὶ τοῦτο λέγεις .  
"True," he said, "you speak correctly."

1006  
ἀλλ’ ἄρα ὅτι τὸ ἱππικὸν οἴει τῇ πόλει βέλτιον ἂν ποιήσας παραδοῦναι καί , εἴ τις χρεία γίγνοιτο ἱππέων , τούτων ἡγούμενος ἀγαθοῦ τινος αἴτιος γενέσθαι τῇ πόλει ;  
"But perhaps you think you can hand over the cavalry in better condition to the state when you retire, and can do something for the good of the state as a cavalry leader, in case there is any occasion to employ that arm?"

1007  
καὶ μάλα , ἔφη .  
"Yes, certainly," he said.

1008  
καὶ ἔστι γε νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , καλόν , ἐὰν δύνῃ ταῦτα ποιῆσαι .  
"Yes," said Socrates, "and no doubt it is a fine thing if you can do that."

1009  
ἡ δὲ ἀρχή που ἐφ’ ἧς ᾕρησαι ἵππων τε καὶ ἀμβατῶν ἐστιν .  
"The command, I presume, for which you have been chosen, is the command of horses and riders."

1010  
ἔστι γὰρ οὖν , ἔφη .  
"Indeed it is."

1011  
ἴθι δὴ λέξον ἡμῖν τοῦτο πρῶτον , ὅπως διανοῇ τοὺς ἵππους βελτίους ποιῆσαι .  
"Come then, tell us first how you propose to improve the horses."

1012  
καὶ ὅς , ἀλλὰ τοῦτο μέν , ἔφη , οὐκ ἐμὸν οἶμαι τὸ ἔργον εἶναι , ἀλλὰ ἰδίᾳ ἕκαστον δεῖν τοῦ ἑαυτοῦ ἵππου ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .  
"Oh, but I don’t think that is my business. Every man must look after his own horse."

1013  
ἐὰν οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , παρέχωνταί σοι τοὺς ἵππους οἱ μὲν οὕτω κακόποδας ἢ κακοσκελεῖς ἢ ἀσθενεῖς , οἱ δὲ οὕτως ἀτρόφους , ὥστε μὴ δύνασθαι ἀκολουθεῖν , οἱ δὲ οὕτως ἀναγώγους ὥστε μὴ μένειν ὅπου ἂν σὺ τά

ξῃς , οἱ δὲ οὕτω λακτιστὰς ὥστε μηδὲ τάξαι δυνατὸν εἶναι , τί σοι τοῦ ἱππικοῦ ὄφελος ἔσται ;  
"Then if some of your men appear on parade with their horses ailing or suffering from bad feet or sore legs, others with underfed animals that can’t go the pace, others with restive brutes that won’t keep in line, others with such bad kickers that it is impossible to line them up at all, what will you be able to make of your cavalry?"

1014  
ἢ πῶς δυνήσῃ τοιούτων ἡγούμενος ἀγαθόν τι ποιῆσαι τὴν πόλιν ;  
"how will you be able to do the state any good with a command like that?"

1015  
καὶ ὅς , ἀλλὰ καλῶς τε λέγεις , ἔφη , καὶ πειράσομαι τῶν ἵππων εἰς τὸ δυνατὸν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι .  
"I am much obliged to you," he replied, "and I will try to look after the horses carefully."

1016  
τί δέ ; τοὺς ἱππέας οὐκ ἐπιχειρήσεις , ἔφη , βελτίονας ποιῆσαι ;  
"Won’t you also try to improve the men?" asked Socrates.

1017  
ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη .  
"I will," he said.

1018  
οὐκοῦν πρῶτον μὲν ἀναβατικωτέρους ἐπὶ τοὺς ἵππους ποιήσεις αὐτούς ;  
"Then will you first train them to mount better?"

1019  
δεῖ γοῦν , ἔφη · καὶ γὰρ εἴ τις αὐτῶν καταπέσοι , μᾶλλον ἂν οὕτω σῴζοιτο .  
"Oh yes, I must," he replied, "so that if anyone is thrown he may have a better chance of saving himself."

1020  
τί γάρ ; ἐάν που κινδυνεύειν δέῃ , πότερον ἐπάγειν τοὺς πολεμίους ἐπὶ τὴν ἄμμον κελεύσεις , ἔνθαπερ εἰώθατε ἱππεύειν , ἢ πειράσῃ τὰς μελέτας ἐν τοιούτοις ποιεῖσθαι χωρίοις ἐν οἵοισπερ οἱ πόλεμοι γίγνονται ;  
"Further, when there is some danger before you, will you order them to draw the enemy into the sandy ground where your manoeuvres are held, or will you try to carry out your training in the kind of country that the enemy occupy?"

1021  
βέλτιον γοῦν , ἔφη .  
"Oh yes, that is the better way," he agreed.

1022  
τί γάρ ; τοῦ βάλλειν ὡς πλείστους ἀπὸ τῶν ἵππων ἐπιμέλειάν τινα ποιήσει ;  
"And again, will you pay much attention to bringing down as many of the enemy as possible without dismounting?"

1023  
βέλτιον γοῦν , ἔφη , καὶ τοῦτο .  
"Oh yes, that too is the better way," he said.

1024  
θήγειν δὲ τὰς ψυχὰς τῶν ἱππέων καὶ ἐξοργίζειν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους , ἅπερ ἀλκιμωτέρους ποιεῖ , διανενόησαι ;  
"Have you thought of fostering a keen spirit among the men and hatred of the enemy, so as to make them more gallant in action?"

1025  
εἰ δὲ μή , ἀλλὰ νῦν γε πειράσομαι , ἔφη .  
"Well, at any rate, I will try to do so now," he replied.

1030
ὅπως δέ σοι πείθωνται οἱ ἱππεῖς πεφρόντικάς τι ;
"And have you considered how to make the men obey you?"

1031
ἄνευ γὰρ δὴ τούτου οὔτε ἵππων οὔτε ἱππέων ἀγαθῶν καὶ ἀλκίμων οὐδὲν ὄφελος .
"Because without that horses and men, however good and gallant, are of no use."

1032
ἀληθῆ λέγεις , ἔφη ·
"True," he said.

1033
ἀλλὰ πῶς ἄν τις μάλιστα , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἐπὶ τοῦτο αὐτοὺς προτρέψαιτο ;
"But what is the best way of encouraging them to obey, Socrates?"

1034
ἐκεῖνο μὲν δήπου οἶσθα , ὅτι ἐν παντὶ πράγματι οἱ ἄνθρωποι τούτοις μάλιστα ἐθέλουσι πείθεσθαι οὓς ἂν ἡγῶνται βελτίστους εἶναι .
"Well, I suppose you know that under all conditions human beings are most willing to obey those whom they believe to be the best."

1035
καὶ γὰρ ἐν νόσῳ , ὃν ἂν ἡγῶνται ἰατρικώτατον εἶναι , τούτῳ μάλιστα πείθονται , καὶ ἐν πλοίῳ οἱ πλέοντες , ὃν ἂν κυβερνητικώτατον , καὶ ἐν γεωργίᾳ , ὃν ἂν γεωργικώτατον .
"Thus in sickness they most readily obey the doctor, on board ship the pilot, on a farm the farmer, whom they think to be most skilled in his business."

1036
καὶ μάλα , ἔφη .
"Yes, certainly," he said.

1037
οὐκοῦν εἰκός , ἔφη , καὶ ἐν ἱππικῇ , ὃς ἂν μάλιστα εἰδὼς φαίνηται ἃ δεῖ ποιεῖν , τούτῳ μάλιστα ἐθέλειν τοὺς ἄλλους πείθεσθαι .
"Then it is likely that in horsemanship too, one who clearly knows best what ought to be done will most easily gain the obedience of the others."

1038  
ἐὰν οὖν , ἔφη , ἐγώ , ὦ Σώκρατες , βέλτιστος ὢν αὐτῶν δῆλος ὦ , ἀρκέσει μοι τοῦτο εἰς τὸ πείθεσθαι αὐτοὺς ἐμοί ;  
"If then, Socrates, I am plainly the best horseman among them, will that suffice to gain their obedience?"

1039  
ἐάν γε πρὸς τούτῳ , ἔφη , διδάξῃς αὐτοὺς ὡς τὸ πείθεσθαί σοι κάλλιόν τε καὶ σωτηριώτερον αὐτοῖς ἔσται .  
"Yes, if you also show them that it will be safer and more honourable for them to obey you."

1040  
πῶς οὖν , ἔφη , τοῦτο διδάξω ;  
"How, then, shall I show that?"

1041  
πολὺ νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , ῥᾷον ἢ εἴ σοι δέοι διδάσκειν ὡς τὰ κακὰ τῶν ἀγαθῶν ἀμείνω καὶ λυσιτελέστερά ἐστι .  
"Well, it’s far easier than if you had to show them that bad is better than good and more profitable."

1042  
λέγεις , ἔφη , σὺ τὸν ἵππαρχον πρὸς τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπιμελεῖσθαι δεῖν καὶ τοῦ λέγειν δύνασθαι ;  
"Do you mean that in addition to his other duties a cavalry leader must take care to be a good speaker?"

1043  
σὺ δ’ ᾤου , ἔφη , χρῆναι σιωπῇ ἱππαρχεῖν ;  
"Did you suppose that a commander of cavalry should be mum?"

1044  
ἢ οὐκ ἐντεθύμησαι ὅτι , ὅσα τε νόμῳ μεμαθήκαμεν κάλλιστα ὄντα , δι’ ὧν γε ζῆν ἐπιστάμεθα , ταῦτα πάντα διὰ λόγου ἐμάθομεν , καὶ εἴ τι ἄλλο καλὸν μανθάνει τις μάθημα , διὰ λόγου μανθάνει , καὶ οἱ ἄριστα διδάσκοντες μάλιστα λόγῳ χρῶνται καὶ οἱ τὰ σπουδαιότατα μάλιστα ἐπιστάμενοι κάλλιστα διαλέγονται ;  
"Did you never reflect that all the best we learned according to custom — the learning, I mean, that teaches us how to live — we learned by means of words, and that every other good lesson to be learned is learned by means of words; that

 the best teachers rely most on the spoken word and those with the deepest knowledge of the greatest subjects are the best talkers?"

1045  
ἢ τόδε οὐκ ἐντεθύμησαι , ὡς , ὅταν γε χορὸς εἷς ἐκ τῆσδε τῆς πόλεως γίγνηται , ὥσπερ ὁ εἰς Δῆλον πεμπόμενος , οὐδεὶς ἄλλοθεν οὐδαμόθεν τούτῳ ἐφάμιλλος γίγνεται οὐδὲ εὐανδρία ἐν ἄλλῃ πόλει ὁμοία τῇ ἐνθάδε συνάγεται ;  
"Did you never reflect that, whenever one chorus is selected from the citizens of this state — for instance, the chorus that is sent to Delos — no choir from any other place can compare with it, and no state can collect so goodly a company?"

1046  
ἀληθῆ λέγεις , ἔφη .  
"You speak the truth," he said.

1047  
ἀλλὰ μὴν οὔτε εὐφωνίᾳ τοσοῦτον διαφέρουσιν Ἀθηναῖοι τῶν ἄλλων οὔτε σωμάτων μεγέθει καὶ ῥώμῃ , ὅσον φιλοτιμίᾳ , ἥπερ μάλιστα παροξύνει πρὸς τὰ καλὰ καὶ ἔντιμα .  
"And yet the reason is that Athenians excel all others not so much in singing or in stature or in strength, as in love of honour, which is the strongest incentive to deeds of honour and renown."

1048  
ἀληθές , ἔφη , καὶ τοῦτο .  
"True again," he said.

1049  
οὐκοῦν οἴει , ἔφη , καὶ τοῦ ἱππικοῦ τοῦ ἐνθάδε εἴ τις ἐπιμεληθείη , ὡς πολὺ ἂν καὶ τούτῳ διενέγκοιεν τῶν ἄλλων ὅπλων τε καὶ ἵππων παρασκευῇ καὶ εὐταξίᾳ καὶ τῷ ἑτοίμως κινδυνεύειν πρὸς τοὺς πολεμίους , εἰ νομίσειαν ταῦτα ποιοῦντες ἐπαίνου καὶ τιμῆς τεύξεσθαι ;  
"Then don’t you think that if one took the same pains with our cavalry, they too would greatly excel others in arms and horses and discipline and readiness to face the enemy, if they thought that they would win glory and honour by it?"

1050  
εἰκός γε , ἔφη .  
"I expect so," he said.

1051  
μὴ τοίνυν ὄκνει , ἔφη , ἀλλὰ πειρῶ τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐπὶ ταῦτα προτρέπειν , ἀφ’ ὧν αὐτός τε ὠφελήσῃ καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι πολῖται διὰ σέ .  
"Don’t hesitate then, but try to encourage this keenness among the men: both you and your fellow-citizens will benefit by the results of your efforts."

1052  
ἀλλὰ νὴ Δία πειράσομαι , ἔφη .  
"Most certainly I will try," he said.

1053  
ἰδὼν δέ ποτε Νικομαχίδην ἐξ ἀρχαιρεσιῶν ἀπιόντα ἤρετο ·  
Once on seeing Nicomachides returning from the elections, he asked,

1054  
τίνες , ὦ Νικομαχίδη , στρατηγοὶ ᾕρηνται ;  
"Who have been

 chosen generals, Nicomachides?"

1055  
καὶ ὅς , οὐ γάρ , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , τοιοῦτοί εἰσιν Ἀθηναῖοι , ὥστε ἐμὲ μὲν οὐχ εἵλοντο , ὃς ἐκ καταλόγου στρατευόμενος κατατέτριμμαι καὶ λοχαγῶν καὶ ταξιαρχῶν καὶ τραύματα ὑπὸ τῶν πολεμίων τοσαῦτα ἔχων — ἅμα δὲ καὶ τὰς οὐλὰς τῶν τραυμάτων ἀπογυμνούμενος ἐπεδείκνυεν — Ἀντισθένη δέ , ἔφη , εἵλοντο τὸν οὔτε ὁπλίτην πώποτε στρατευσάμενον ἔν τε τοῖς ἱππεῦσιν οὐδὲν περίβλεπτον ποιήσαντα ἐπιστάμενόν τε ἄλλο οὐδὲν ἢ χρήματα συλλέγειν ;  
“Isn’t it like the Athenians?" replied he, "they haven’t chosen me after all the hard work I have done, since I was called up, in the command of company or regiment, though I have been so often wounded in action” (and here he uncovered and showed his scars); “yet they have chosen Antisthenes, who has never served in a marching regiment nor distinguished himself in the cavalry and understands nothing but money-making.”

1056  
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , τοῦτο μὲν ἀγαθόν , εἴ γε τοῖς στρατιώταις ἱκανὸς ἔσται τὰ ἐπιτήδεια πορίζειν ;  
"Isn’t that a recommendation," said Socrates, "supposing he proves capable of supplying the men’s needs?"

1057  
καὶ γὰρ οἱ ἔμποροι , ἔφη ὁ Νικομαχίδης , χρήματα συλλέγειν ἱκανοί εἰσιν .  
"Why," retorted Nicomachides, "merchants too are capable of making money, but that doesn’t make them fit to command an army."

1058  
ἀλλ’ οὐχ ἕνεκα τούτου καὶ στρατηγεῖν δύναιντ’ ἄν .  
"But that doesn’t qualify them for generalship."

1059  
καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·  
And Socrates said:

1060  
ἀλλὰ καὶ φιλόνικος Ἀντισθένης ἐστίν , ὃ στρατηγῷ προσεῖναι ἐπιτήδειόν ἐστιν ·  
"But Antisthenes also is eager for victory, and that is a good point in a general."

1061  
οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι καὶ ὁσάκις κεχορήγηκε πᾶσι τοῖς χοροῖς νενίκηκε ;  
"Whenever he has been choragus, you know, his choir has always won."

1062  
μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη ὁ Νικομαχίδης , ἀλλ’ οὐδὲν ὅμοιόν ἐστι χοροῦ τε καὶ στρατεύματος προεστάναι .  
"No doubt," said Nicomachides, "but there is no analogy between the handling of a choir and of an army."

1063  
καὶ μήν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , οὐδὲ ᾠδῆς γε ὁ Ἀντισθένης οὐδὲ χορῶν διδασκαλίας ἔμπειρος ὢν ὅμως ἐγένετο ἱκανὸς εὑρεῖν τοὺς κρατίστους ταῦτα .  
"But, you see," said Socrates, "though Antisthenes knows nothing about music or choir training, he showed himself capable of finding the best experts in these."

1064  
καὶ ἐν τῇ στρατηγίᾳ οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Νικομαχίδης , ἄλλους μὲν εὑρήσει τοὺς τάξοντας ἀνθ’ ἑαυτοῦ , ἄλλους δὲ τοὺς μαχουμένους .

  
"In the army too, then," said Nicomachides, "he will find other to command for him, and others to do the fighting."

1065  
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ἐάν γε καὶ ἐν τοῖς πολεμικοῖς τοὺς κρατίστους , ὥσπερ ἐν τοῖς χορικοῖς , ἐξευρίσκῃ τε καὶ προαιρῆται , εἰκότως ἂν καὶ τούτου νικηφόρος εἴη ·  
"And therefore," said Socrates, "if he finds out and prefers the best men in warfare as in choir training it is likely that he will be victorious in that too; and probably he will be more ready to spend on winning a battle with the whole state than on winning a choral competition with his tribe."

1066
καὶ δαπανᾶν δ’ αὐτὸν εἰκὸς μᾶλλον ἂν ἐθέλειν εἰς τὴν σὺν ὅλῃ τῇ πόλει τῶν πολεμικῶν νίκην ἢ εἰς τὴν σὺν τῇ φυλῇ τῶν χορικῶν .
and probably he will be more ready to spend on winning a battle with the whole state than on winning a choral competition with his tribe."

1067  
λέγεις σύ , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , ὡς τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἀνδρός ἐστι χορηγεῖν τε καλῶς καὶ στρατηγεῖν ;  
"Do you mean to say, Socrates, that the man who succeeds with a chorus will also succeed with an army?"

1068  
λέγω ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη , ὡς , ὅτου ἄν τις προστατεύῃ , ἐὰν γιγνώσκῃ τε ὧν δεῖ καὶ ταῦτα πορίζεσθαι δύνηται , ἀγαθὸς ἂν εἴη προστάτης , εἴτε χοροῦ εἴτε οἴκου εἴτε πόλεως εἴτε στρατεύματος προστατεύοι .  
"I mean that, whatever a man controls, if he knows what he wants and can get it, he will be a good controller, whether he control a chorus, an estate, a city, or an army."

1069  
καὶ ὁ Νικομαχίδης , μὰ Δί’ , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , οὐκ ἄν ποτε ᾤμην ἐγὼ σοῦ ἀκοῦσαι ὡς οἱ ἀγαθοὶ οἰκονόμοι ἀγαθοὶ στρατηγοὶ ἂν εἶεν .  
"Really, Socrates," cried Nicomachides, "I should never have thought to hear you say that a good business man would make a good general."

1070  
ἴθι δή , ἔφη , ἐξετάσωμεν τὰ ἔργα ἑκατέρου αὐτῶν , ἵνα εἰδῶμεν πότερον τὰ αὐτά ἐστιν ἢ διαφέρει τι .  
"Come then," said he, "let us review the duties of each, that we may know whether they are the same or different."

1071  
πάνυ γε , ἔφη .  
"By all means."

1072  
οὐκοῦν , ἔφη , τὸ μὲν τοὺς ἀρχομένους κατηκόους τε καὶ εὐπειθεῖς ἑαυτοῖς παρασκευάζειν ἀμφοτέρων ἐστὶν ἔργον ;  
"Is it not the duty of both to make their subordinates willing and obedient?"

1073  
καὶ μάλα , ἔφη .  
"Decidedly."

1074
τί δέ ; 
What then?

1075  
τὸ προστάττειν ἕκαστα τοῖς ἐπιτηδείοις πράττειν ;  
"And to put the right man in the right place?"

1076  
καὶ τοῦτ’ , ἔφη .  
"That is so."

1077  
καὶ μὴν τὸ

 τοὺς κακοὺς κολάζειν καὶ τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς τιμᾶν ἀμφοτέροις οἶμαι προσήκειν .  
"I suppose, moreover, that both should punish the bad and reward the good."

1078  
πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .  
"Yes, certainly."

1079  
τὸ δὲ τοὺς ὑπηκόους εὐμενεῖς ποιεῖσθαι πῶς οὐ καλὸν ἀμφοτέροις ;  
"Of course, both will do well to win the goodwill of those under them?"

1080  
καὶ τοῦτ’ , ἔφη .  
"That is so."

1081  
συμμάχους δὲ καὶ βοηθοὺς προσάγεσθαι δοκεῖ σοι συμφέρειν ἀμφοτέροις ἢ οὔ ;  
"Do you think that it is to the interest of both to attract allies and helpers?"

1082  
πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .  
"Yes, certainly."

1083  
ἀλλὰ φυλακτικοὺς τῶν ὄντων οὐκ ἀμφοτέρους εἶναι προσήκει ;  
"And should not both be able to keep what they have got?"

1084  
σφόδρα γ’ , ἔφη .  
"They should indeed."

1085  
οὐκοῦν καὶ ἐπιμελεῖς καὶ φιλοπόνους ἀμφοτέρους εἶναι προσήκει περὶ τὰ αὑτῶν ἔργα ;  
"And should not both be strenuous and industrious in their own work?"

1086	ταῦτα μέν , ἔφη , πάντα ὁμοίως ἀμφοτέρων ἐστίν ·
"All these are common to both; 

1087	ἀλλὰ τὸ μάχεσθαι οὐκέτι ἀμφοτέρων .
but fighting is not."


1088	ἀλλ’ ἐχθροί γέ τοι ἀμφοτέροις γίγνονται ;
"But surely both are bound to find enemies?"


1089	καὶ μάλα , ἔφη , τοῦτό γε .
"Oh yes, they are," he said.


1090	οὐκοῦν τὸ περιγενέσθαι τούτων ἀμφοτέροις συμφέρει ;
"Then is it not important for both to get the better of them?"



1091	πάνυ γ’ , ἔφη ·
"Undoubtedly; 

1092	ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνο παρίης , ἂν δέῃ μάχεσθαι , τί ὠφελήσει ἡ οἰκονομική ;
but you don’t say how business capacity will help when it comes to fighting. 

1093	ἐνταῦθα δήπου καὶ πλεῖστον , ἔφη ·
That is just where it will be most helpful. 

1094	ὁ γὰρ ἀγαθὸς οἰκονόμος , εἰδὼς ὅτι οὐδὲν οὕτω λυσιτελές τε καὶ κερδαλέον ἐστίν , ὡς τὸ μαχόμενον τοὺς πολεμίους νικᾶν , οὐδὲ οὕτως ἀλυσιτελές τε καὶ ζημιῶδες , ὡς τὸ ἡττᾶσθαι , προθύμως μὲν τὰ πρὸς τὸ νικᾶν συμφέροντα ζητήσει καὶ παρασκευάσεται , ἐπιμελῶς δὲ τὰ πρὸς τὸ ἡττᾶσθαι φέροντα σκέψεται καὶ φυλάξεται , ἐνεργῶς δ’ , ἂν τὴν παρασκευὴν ὁρᾷ νικητικὴν οὖσαν , μαχεῖται , οὐχ ἥκιστα δὲ τούτων , ἐὰν ἀπαράσκευος ᾖ , φυλάξεται συνάπτειν μάχην .
For the good business man, through his knowledge that nothing profits or pays like a victory in the field, and nothing is so utterly unprofitable and entails such heavy loss as a defeat, will be eager to seek and furnish all aids to victory, careful to consider and avoid what leads to defeat, prompt to engage the enemy if he sees he is strong enough to win, and, above all, will avoid an engagement when he is not ready."

1095	μὴ καταφρόνει , ἔφη , ὦ Νικομαχίδη , τῶν οἰκονομικῶν ἀνδρῶν ·
"Don’t look down on business men, Nicomachides. 

1096	ἡ γὰρ τῶν ἰδίων ἐπιμέλεια πλήθει μόνον διαφέρει τῆς τῶν κοινῶν , τὰ δὲ ἄλλα παραπλήσια ἔχει , τὸ δὲ μέγιστον , ὅτι οὔτε ἄνευ ἀνθρώπων οὐδετέρα γίγνεται οὔτε δι’ ἄλλων μὲν ἀνθρώπων τὰ ἴδια πράττεται , δι’ ἄλλων δὲ τὰ κοινά .
For the management of private concerns differs only in point of number from that of public affairs. In other respects they are much alike, and particularly in this, that neither can be carried on without men, and the men employed in private and public transactions are the same.  

1097	οὐ γὰρ ἄλλοις τισὶν ἀνθρώποις οἱ τῶν κοινῶν ἐπιμελόμενοι χρῶνται ἢ οἷσπερ τὰ ἴδια οἰκονομοῦντες ·
For those who take charge of public affairs employ just the same men when they attend to their own;

1098	οἷς οἱ ἐπιστάμενοι χρῆσθαι καὶ τὰ ἴδια καὶ τὰ κοινὰ καλῶς πράττουσιν , οἱ δὲ μὴ ἐπιστάμενοι ἀμφοτέρωθι πλημμελοῦσι .
and those who understand how to employ them are successful directors of public and private concerns, and those who do not, fail in both."

1099 Περικλεῖ δέ ποτε τῷ τοῦ πάνυ Περικλέους υἱῷ διαλεγόμενος , ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη , ὦ Περίκλεις , ἐλπίδα ἔχω σοῦ στρατηγήσαντος ἀμείνω τε καὶ ἐνδοξοτέραν τὴν πόλιν εἰς τὰ πολεμικὰ ἔσεσθαι καὶ τῶν πολεμίων κρατήσειν.
Once when talking with the son of the great Pericles, he said: "For my part, Pericles, I feel hopeful that, now you have become general, our city will be more efficient and more famous in the art of war, and will defeat our enemies."

1100 καὶ ὁ Περικλῆς , βουλοίμην ἄν , ἔφη , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἃ λέγεις ·
"I could wish," answered Pericles, "that it might be as you say, Socrates; but how these changes are to come about I cannot see."

1101 ὅπως δὲ ταῦτα γένοιτ’ ἄν , οὐ δύναμαι γνῶναι .
"But how these changes are to come about I cannot see."

1102 βούλει οὖν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , διαλογιζόμενοι περὶ αὐτῶν ἐπισκοπῶμεν ὅπου ἤδη τὸ δυνατόν ἐστι ;
"Should you like to discuss them with me, then," said Socrates, "and consider how they can be brought about?"

1103 βούλομαι , ἔφη .
"I should."

1104 οὐκοῦν οἶσθα , ἔφη , ὅτι πλήθει μὲν οὐδὲν μείους εἰσὶν Ἀθηναῖοι Βοιωτῶν ;
"Do you know then, that in point of numbers the Athenians are not inferior to the Boeotians?"

1105 οἶδα γάρ , ἔφη .
"Yes, I know."

1106 σώματα δὲ ἀγαθὰ καὶ καλὰ πότερον ἐκ Βοιωτῶν οἴει πλείω ἂν ἐκλεχθῆναι ἢ ἐξ Ἀθηνῶν ;
"Do you think that the larger number of fine, well-developed men could be selected from among the Boeotians or the Athenians?"

1107 οὐδὲ ταύτῃ μοι δοκοῦσι λείπεσθαι .
"In that matter too they seem to be at no disadvantage."

1108 εὐμενεστέρους δὲ ποτέρους ἑαυτοῖς εἶναι νομίζεις ;
"Which do you think are the more united?"

1109	Ἀθηναίους ἔγωγε ·
"The Athenians, I should say, 

1110	Βοιωτῶν μὲν γὰρ πολλοὶ πλεονεκτούμενοι ὑπὸ Θηβαίων δυσμενῶς αὐτοῖς ἔχουσιν , Ἀθήνησι δὲ οὐδὲν ὁρῶ τοιοῦτον .
for many of the Boeotians resent the selfish behaviour of the Thebans. At Athens I see nothing of that sort."

1111	ἀλλὰ μὴν φιλοτιμότατοί γε καὶ φιλοφρονέστατοι πάντων εἰσίν ·  
And again, the Athenians are more ambitious and more high-minded than other peoples;

1112	ἅπερ οὐχ ἥκιστα παροξύνει κινδυνεύειν ὑπὲρ εὐδοξίας τε καὶ πατρίδος.  
and these qualities are among the strongest incentives to heroism and patriotic self-sacrifice.

1113	οὐδὲ ἐν τούτοις Ἀθηναῖοι μεμπτοί.  
Yes, in these respects too the Athenians need not fear criticism.

1114	καὶ μὴν προγόνων γε καλὰ ἔργα οὐκ ἔστιν οἷς μείζω καὶ πλείω ὑπάρχει ἢ Ἀθηναίοις ·  
And besides, none have inherited a past more crowded with great deeds;

1115	ᾧ πολλοὶ ἐπαιρόμενοι προτρέπονταί τε ἀρετῆς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι καὶ ἄλκιμοι γίγνεσθαι.  
and many are heartened by such a heritage and encouraged to care for virtue and prove their gallantry.

1116	ταῦτα μὲν ἀληθῆ λέγεις πάντα, ὦ Σώκρατες ·  
All you have said is true, Socrates.

1117	ἀλλ’ ὁρῷς, ὅτι, ἀφ’ οὗ ἥ τε σὺν Τολμίδῃ τῶν χιλίων ἐν Λεβαδείᾳ συμφορὰ ἐγένετο καὶ ἡ μεθ’ Ἱπποκράτους ἐπὶ Δηλίῳ, ἐκ τούτων τεταπείνωται μὲν ἡ τῶν Ἀθηναίων δόξα πρὸς τοὺς Βοιωτούς, ἐπῆρται δὲ τὸ τῶν Θηβαίων φρόνημα πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους ·  
But, you see, since the disasters sustained by Tolmides and the Thousand at Lebadea and by Hippocrates at Delium, the relations of the Athenians and Boeotians are changed: the glory of the Athenians is brought low, the pride of the Thebans is exalted;

1118	ὥστε Βοιωτοὶ μέν, οἱ πρόσθεν οὐδ’ ἐν τῇ ἑαυτῶν τολμῶντες Ἀθηναίοις ἄνευ Λακεδαιμονίων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων Πελοποννησίων ἀντιτάττεσθαι, νῦν ἀπειλ

οῦσιν αὐτοὶ καθ’ αὑτοὺς ἐμβαλεῖν εἰς τὴν Ἀττικήν, Ἀθηναῖοι δέ, οἱ πρότερον ὅτε Βοιωτοὶ μόνοι ἐγένοντο πορθοῦντες τὴν Βοιωτίαν, φοβοῦνται μὴ Βοιωτοὶ δῃώσωσι τὴν Ἀττικήν.  
and now the Boeotians, who formerly would not venture, even in their own country, to face the Athenians without help from Sparta and the rest of the Peloponnese, threaten to invade Attica by themselves, and the Athenians, who formerly overran Boeotia, fear that the Boeotians may plunder Attica.

1119	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης, ἀλλ’ αἰσθάνομαι μέν, ἔφη, ταῦτα οὕτως ἔχοντα ·  
Ah, I am aware of that, answered Socrates;

1120	δοκεῖ δέ μοι ἀνδρὶ ἀγαθῷ ἄρχοντι νῦν εὐαρεστοτέρως διακεῖσθαι ἡ πόλις.  
but the disposition of our city is now more to a good ruler’s liking.

1121	τὸ μὲν γὰρ θάρσος ἀμέλειάν τε καὶ ῥᾳθυμίαν καὶ ἀπείθειαν ἐμβάλλει, ὁ δὲ φόβος προσεκτικωτέρους τε καὶ εὐπειθεστέρους καὶ εὐτακτοτέρους ποιεῖ.  
For confidence breeds carelessness, slackness, disobedience: fear makes men more attentive, more obedient, more amenable to discipline.

1122	τεκμήραιο δ’ ἂν τοῦτο καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν ἐν ταῖς ναυσίν ·
The behaviour of sailors is a case in point.  


1123	ὅταν μὲν γὰρ δήπου μηδὲν φοβῶνται, μεστοί εἰσιν ἀταξίας ·  
So long as they have nothing to fear, they are, I believe, an unruly lot,

1124	ἔστ’ ἂν δὲ ἢ χειμῶνα ἢ πολεμίους δείσωσιν, οὐ μόνον τὰ κελευόμενα πάντα ποιοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ σιγῶσι καραδοκοῦντες τὰ προσταχθησόμενα, ὥσπερ χορευταί.  
but when they expect a storm or an attack, they not only carry out all orders, but watch in silence for the word of command like choristers.

1125	ἀλλὰ μήν, ἔφη ὁ Περικλῆς, εἴ γε νῦν μάλιστα πείθοιντο, ὥρα ἂν εἴη λέγειν, πῶς ἂν αὐτοὺς προτρεψαίμεθα πάλιν ἀνερασθῆναι τῆς ἀρχαίας ἀρετῆς τε καὶ εὐκλείας καὶ εὐδαιμονίας.  
Well, exclaimed Pericles, if they are now in the mood for obedience, it seems time to say how we can revive in them a longing for the old virtue and fame and happiness.

1126	οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, εἰ μὲν ἐβουλόμεθα χρημάτων αὐτοὺς ὧν οἱ ἄλλοι εἶχον ἀντιποιεῖσθαι, ἀποδεικνύντες αὐτοῖς ταῦτα πατρῷά τε ὄντα καὶ προσήκοντα μάλιστ’ ἂν οὕτως αὐτοὺς ἐξωρμῶμεν ἀντέχεσθαι τούτων ·  
If then, said Socrates, we wanted them to claim money that others held, the best way of egging them on to seize it would be to show them that it was their fathers’ money and belongs to them.

1127	ἐπεὶ δὲ τοῦ μετ’ ἀρετῆς πρωτεύειν αὐτοὺς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι βουλόμεθα, τοῦτ’ αὖ δεικτέον ἐκ παλαιοῦ μάλιστα προσῆκον αὐτοῖς, καὶ ὡς τούτου ἐπιμελόμενοι πάντων ἂν εἶεν κράτιστοι.  
As we want them to strive for pre-eminence in virtue, we must show that this belonged to them in old days, and that by striving for it they will surpass all other men.

1128	πῶς οὖν ἂν τοῦτο διδάσκοιμεν;  
How then can we teach this?

1129	οἶμαι μέν, εἰ τούς γε παλαιτάτους ὧν ἀκούομεν προγόνους αὐτῶν ἀναμιμνῄσκοιμεν αὐτοὺς ἀκηκοότας ἀρίστους γεγονέναι.  
I think by reminding them that their earliest ancestors of whom we have any account were, as they themselves have been told, the most valiant.

1130	ἆρα λέγεις τὴν τῶν θεῶν κρίσιν, ἣν οἱ περὶ Κέκροπα δι’ ἀρετὴν ἔκριναν;  
Do you refer to the judgment of the gods, which Cecrops delivered in his court because of his virtue?

1131	λέγω γάρ, καὶ τὴν Ἐρεχθέως γε τροφὴν καὶ γένεσιν, καὶ τὸν πόλεμον τὸν ἐπ’ ἐκείνου γενόμενον πρὸς τοὺς ἐκ τῆς ἐχομένης ἠπείρου πάσης, καὶ τὸν ἐφ’ Ἡρακλειδῶν πρὸς τοὺς ἐν Πελοποννήσῳ, καὶ πάντας τοὺς ἐπὶ Θησέως πολεμηθέντας, ἐν οἷς πᾶσιν ἐκεῖνοι δῆλοι γεγόνασι τῶν καθ’ ἑαυτοὺς ἀνθρώπων ἀριστεύσαντες ·  
Yes, and the care and birth of Erectheus, and the war waged in his day with all the adjacent country, and the war between the sons of Heracles and the Peloponnesians, and all the wars waged in the days of Theseus, in all of which it is manifest that they were champions among the men of their time.

1132	εἰ δὲ βούλει, ἃ ὕστερον οἱ ἐκείνων μὲν ἀπόγονοι, οὐ πολὺ δὲ πρὸ ἡμῶν γεγονότες ἔπραξαν, τὰ μὲν αὐτοὶ καθ’ αὑτοὺς ἀγωνιζόμενοι πρὸς τοὺς κυριεύοντας τῆς τε Ἀσίας πάσης καὶ τῆς Εὐρώπης μέχρι Μακεδονίας καὶ πλείστην τῶν προγεγονότων δύναμιν καὶ ἀφορμὴν κεκτημένους καὶ μέγιστα ἔργα κατειργασμένους, τὰ δὲ καὶ μετὰ Πελοποννησίων ἀριστεύοντες καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλατταν ·  
You may add the victories of their descendants, who lived not long before our own day: some they gained unaided in their struggle with the lords of all Asia and of Europe as far as Macedonia, the owners of more power and wealth than the world had ever seen, who had wrought deeds that none had equalled; in others they were fellow-champions with the Peloponnesians both on land and sea. 

1133	οἳ δὴ καὶ λέγονται πολὺ διενεγκεῖν τῶν καθ’ αὑτοὺς ἀνθρώπων.  
These men, like their fathers, are reported to have been far superior to all other men of their time.

1134	λέγονται γάρ, ἔφη.  
Yes, that is the report of them.

1135	τοιγαροῦν πολλῶν μὲν μεταναστάσεων ἐν τῇ Ἑλλάδι γεγονυιῶν διέμειναν ἐν τῇ ἑαυτῶν, πολλοὶ δὲ ὑπὲρ δικαίων ἀντιλέγοντες ἐπέτρεπον ἐκείνοις, πολλοὶ δὲ ὑπὸ κρειττόνων ὑβριζόμενοι κατέφευγον πρὸς ἐκείνους.  
Therefore, though there have been many migrations in Greece, these continued to dwell in their own land: many referred to them their rival claims, many found a refuge with them from the brutality of the oppressor.

1136	καὶ ὁ Περικλῆς, καὶ θαυμάζω γ’, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἡ πόλις ὅπως ποτ’ ἐπὶ τὸ χεῖρον ἔκλινεν.  
Yes, Socrates, cried Pericles, and I wonder how our city can have become so degenerate.

1137	ἐγὼ μέν, ἔφη, οἶμαι, ὁ Σωκράτης, ὥσπερ καὶ ἀθληταί τινες διὰ τὸ πολὺ ὑπερενεγκεῖν καὶ κρατιστεῦσαι καταρρᾳθυμήσαντες ὑστερίζουσι τῶν ἀντιπάλων, οὕτω καὶ Ἀθηναίους πολὺ διενεγκόντας ἀμελῆσαι ἑαυτῶν καὶ διὰ τοῦτο χείρους γεγονέναι.  
My own view, replied Socrates, is that the Athenians, as a consequence of their great superiority, grew careless of themselves, and have thus become degenerate, much as athletes who are in a class by themselves and win the championship easily are apt to grow slack and drop below their rivals.

1138	νῦν οὖν, ἔφη, τί ἂν ποιοῦντες ἀναλάβοιεν τὴν ἀρχαίαν ἀρετήν;  
How, then, can they now recover their old virtue?

1139	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ·  
And Socrates said,

1140	οὐδὲν ἀπόκρυφον δοκεῖ μοι εἶναι, ἀλλ’ εἰ μὲν ἐξευρόντες τὰ τῶν προγόνων ἐπιτηδεύματα μηδὲν χεῖρον ἐκείνων ἐπιτηδεύοιεν, οὐδὲν ἂν χείρους ἐκείνων γενέσθαι·  
There is no mystery about it, as I think. If they find out the customs of their ancestors and practise them as well as they did, they will come to be as good as they were;

1141	εἰ δὲ μή, τούς γε νῦν πρωτεύοντας μιμούμενοι καὶ τούτοις τὰ αὐτὰ ἐπιτηδεύοντες, ὁμοίως μὲν τοῖς αὐτοῖς χρώμενοι οὐδὲν ἂν χείρους ἐκείνων εἶεν, εἰ δ’ ἐπιμελέστερον, καὶ βελτίους.  
or failing that, they need but to imitate those who now have the pre-eminence and to practise their customs, and if they are equally careful in observing them, they will be as good as they, and, if more careful, even better.

1142	λέγεις, ἔφη, πόρρω που εἶναι τῇ πόλει τὴν καλοκαγαθίαν.  
That means that it is a long march for our city to perfection.

1143	πότε γὰρ οὕτως Ἀθηναῖοι ὥσπερ Λακεδαιμόνιοι ἢ πρεσβυτέρους αἰδέσονται, οἳ ἀπὸ τῶν πατέρων ἄρχονται καταφρονεῖν τῶν γεραιτέρων, ἢ σωμασκήσουσιν οὕτως, οἳ οὐ μόνον αὐτοὶ εὐεξίας ἀμελοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ἐπιμελομένων καταγελῶσι;  
For when will Athenians show the Lacedaemonian reverence for age, seeing that they despise all their elders, beginning with their own fathers? When will they adopt the Lacedaemonian system of training, seeing that they not only neglect to make themselves fit, but mock at those who take the trouble to do so?

1144	πότε δὲ οὕτω πείσονται τοῖς ἄρχουσιν, οἳ καὶ ἀγάλλονται ἐπὶ τῷ καταφρονεῖν τῶν ἀρχόντων;  
When will they reach that standard of obedience to their rulers, seeing that they make contempt of rulers a point of honour?

1145	ἢ πότε οὕτως ὁμονοήσουσιν, οἵ γε ἀντὶ μὲν τοῦ συνεργεῖν ἑαυτοῖς τὰ συμφέροντα ἐπηρεάζουσιν ἀλλήλοις καὶ φθονοῦσιν ἑαυτοῖς μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἀνθρώποις, μάλιστα δὲ πάντων ἔν τε ταῖς ἰδίαις συνόδοις καὶ ταῖς κοιναῖς διαφέρονται καὶ πλείστας δίκας ἀλλήλοις δικάζονται καὶ προαιροῦνται μᾶλλον οὕτω κερδαίνειν ἀπ’ ἀλλήλων ἢ συνωφελοῦντες αὑτούς, τοῖς δὲ κοινοῖς ὥσπερ ἀλλοτρίοις χρώμενοι περὶ τούτων αὖ μάχονται καὶ ταῖς εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα δυνάμεσι μάλιστα χαίρουσιν;  
Or when will they attain that harmony, seeing that, instead of working together for the general good, they are more envious and bitter against one another than against the rest of the world, are the most quarrelsome of men in public and private assemblies, most often go to law with one another, and would rather make profit of one another so than by mutual service, and while regarding public affairs as alien to themselves, yet fight over them too, and find their chief enjoyment in having the means to carry on such strife?

1146	ἐξ ὧν πολλὴ μὲν ἀτηρία καὶ κακία τῇ πόλει ἐμφύεται , πολλὴ δὲ ἔχθρα καὶ μῖσος ἀλλήλων τοῖς πολίταις ἐγγίγνεται , δι’ ἃ ἔγωγε μάλα φοβοῦμαι ἀεί , μή τι μεῖζον ἢ ὥστε φέρειν δύνασθαι κακὸν τῇ πόλει συμβῇ .
"So it comes about that mischief and evil grow apace in the city, enmity and mutual hatred spring up among the people, so that I am always dreading that some evil past bearing may befall the city."

1147	μηδαμῶς, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ὦ Περίκλεις, οὕτως ἡγοῦ ἀνηκέστῳ πονηρίᾳ νοσεῖν Ἀθηναίους.  
No, no, Pericles, don’t think the wickedness of the Athenians so utterly past remedy.

1148	οὐχ ὁρᾷς, ὡς εὔτακτοι μέν εἰσιν ἐν τοῖς ναυτικοῖς, εὐτάκτως δ’ ἐν τοῖς γυμνικοῖς ἀγῶσι πείθονται τοῖς ἐπιστάταις, οὐδένων δὲ καταδεέστερον ἐν τοῖς χοροῖς ὑπηρετοῦσι τοῖς διδασκάλοις;  
Don’t you see what good discipline they maintain in their fleets, how well they obey the umpires in athletic contests, how they take orders from the choir-trainers as readily as any?

1149	τοῦτο γάρ τοι, ἔφη, καὶ θαυμαστόν ἐστι, τὸ τοὺς μὲν τοιούτους πειθαρχεῖν τοῖς ἐφεστῶσι, τοὺς δὲ ὁπλίτας καὶ τοὺς ἱππέας, οἳ δοκοῦσι καλοκαγαθίᾳ προκεκρίσθαι τῶν πολιτῶν, ἀπειθεστάτους εἶναι πάντων.  
Ah yes, and strange indeed it is that such men submit themselves to their masters, and yet the infantry and cavalry, who are supposed to be the pick of the citizens for good character, are the most insubordinate.

1150	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη·  
Then Socrates asked,

1151	ἡ δὲ ἐν Ἀρείῳ πάγῳ βουλή, ὦ Περίκλεις, οὐκ ἐκ τῶν δεδοκιμασμένων καθίσταται;  
But what of the Court of the Areopagus, Pericles? Are not its members persons who have won approval?

1152	καὶ μάλα, ἔφη.  
Certainly.

1153	οἶσθα οὖν τινας, ἔφη, κάλλιον ἢ νομιμώτερον ἢ σεμνότερον ἢ δικαιότερον τάς τε δίκας δικάζοντας καὶ τ- ἄλλα πάντα πράττοντας;  
Then do you know of any who decide the cases that come before them and perform all their other functions more honourably, more in accordance with law, with more dignity and justice?

1154	οὐ μέμφομαι, ἔφη, τούτοις.  
I am not finding fault with the Areopagus.

1155	οὐ τοίνυν, ἔφη, δεῖ ἀθυμεῖν ὡς οὐκ εὐτάκτων ὄντων Ἀθηναίων.  
Then you must not despair of Athenian discipline.

1156	καὶ μὴν ἔν γε τοῖς στρατιωτικοῖς, ἔφη, ἔνθα μάλιστα δεῖ σωφρονεῖν τε καὶ εὐτακτεῖν καὶ πειθαρχεῖν, οὐδενὶ τούτων προσέχουσιν.  
But, you see, in the army, where good conduct, discipline, submission are most necessary, our people pay no attention to these things.

1157	ἴσως γάρ, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ἐν τούτοις οἱ ἥκιστα ἐπιστάμενοι ἄρχουσιν αὐτῶν.  
This may be due to the incompetence of the officers.

1158	οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι κιθαριστῶν μὲν καὶ χορευτῶν καὶ ὀρχηστῶν οὐδὲ εἷς ἐπιχειρεῖ ἄρχειν μὴ ἐπιστάμενος, οὐδὲ παλαιστῶν οὐδὲ παγκρατιαστῶν;  
You must have noticed that no one attempts to exercise authority over our harpists, choristers and dancers, if he is incompetent, nor over wrestlers or wrestlers who also box?

1159	ἀλλὰ πάντες οἱ τούτων ἄρχοντες ἔχουσι δεῖξαι ὁπόθεν ἔμαθον ταῦτα ἐφ’ οἷς ἐφεστᾶσι ·  
All who have authority over them can tell where they learned their business;

1160	τῶν δὲ στρατηγῶν οἱ πλεῖστοι αὐτοσχεδιάζουσιν.  
but most of our generals are improvisors.

1161	οὐ μέντοι σέ γε τοιοῦτον ἐγὼ νομίζω εἶναι, ἀλλ’ οἶμαί σε οὐδὲν ἧττον ἔχειν εἰπεῖν ὁπότε στρατηγεῖν ἢ ὁπότε παλαίειν ἤρξω μανθάνειν.  
However, I don’t suppose you are one of this sort. I suppose you can say when you began to learn strategy as well as when you began wrestling.

1162	καὶ πολλὰ μὲν οἶμαί σε τῶν πατρῴων στρατηγημάτων παρειληφότα διασῴζειν, πολλὰ δὲ πανταχόθεν συνηχέναι, ὁπόθεν οἷόν τε ἦν μαθεῖν τι ὠφέλιμον εἰς στρατηγίαν.  
Many of the principles, I think, you have inherited from your father, and many others you have gathered from every source from which you could learn anything useful to a general.

1163	οἶμαι δέ σε πολλὰ μεριμνᾶν, ὅπως μὴ λάθῃς σεαυτὸν ἀγνοῶν τι τῶν εἰς στρατηγίαν ὠφελίμων, καὶ ἐάν τι τοιοῦτον αἴσθῃ σεαυτὸν μὴ εἰδότα, ζητεῖν τοὺς ἐπισταμένους ταῦτα, οὔτε δώρων οὔτε χαρίτων φειδόμενον, ὅπως μάθῃς παρ’ αὐτῶν ἃ μὴ ἐπίστασαι καὶ συνεργοὺς ἀγαθοὺς ἔχῃς.  
I think, too, that you take much trouble that you may not unconsciously lack any knowledge useful to a general; and if you find that you don’t know anything, you seek out those who have the knowledge, grudging neither gifts nor thanks, that you may learn what you don’t know from them and may have the help of good coaching.

1164	καὶ ὁ Περικλῆς , οὐ λανθάνεις με , ὦ Σώκρατες , ἔφη , ὅτι οὐδ’ οἰόμενός με τούτων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι ταῦτα λέγεις , ἀλλ’ ἐγχειρῶν με διδάσκειν ὅτι τὸν μέλλοντα στρατηγεῖν τούτων ἁπάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι δεῖ .
"I can see, Socrates, that in saying this you don’t really think I study these things, but you are trying to show me that one who is going to command an army must study all of them; and of course I admit that you are right."

1165	ὁμολογῶ μέντοι κ- ἐγώ σοι ταῦτα.  
I agree with you on these points.

1166	τοῦτο δ’, ἔφη, ὦ Περίκλεις, κατανενόηκας, ὅτι πρόκειται τῆς χώρας ἡμῶν ὄρη μεγάλα, καθήκοντα ἐπὶ τὴν Βοιωτίαν, δι’ ὧν εἰς τὴν χώραν εἴσοδοι στεναί τε καὶ προσάντεις εἰσί, καὶ ὅτι μέση διέζωται ὄρεσιν ἐρυμνοῖς;  
Have you observed, Pericles, that our frontier is protected by great mountains extending to Boeotia, through which there are steep and narrow passes leading into our land, and that the interior is cut across by rugged mountains?

1167	καὶ μάλα, ἔφη.  
Certainly.

1168	τί δέ;  
Further,

1169	ἐκεῖνο ἀκήκοας, ὅτι Μυσοὶ καὶ Πισίδαι ἐν τῇ βασιλέως χώρᾳ κατέχοντες ἐρυμνὰ πάνυ χωρία καὶ κούφως ὡπλισμένοι δύνανται πολλὰ μὲν τὴν βασιλέως χώραν καταθέοντες κακοποιεῖν, αὐτοὶ δὲ ζῆν ἐλεύθεροι;  
Have you heard that the Mysians and Pisidians, occupying very rugged country in the Great King’s territory and lightly armed, contrive to overrun and damage the King’s territory and to preserve their own freedom?

1170	καὶ τοῦτό γ’, ἔφη, ἀκούω.  
Yes, I have heard so.

1171	Ἀθηναίους δ’ οὐκ ἂν οἴει, ἔφη, μέχρι τῆς ἐλαφρᾶς ἡλικίας ὡπλισμένους κουφοτέροις ὅπλοις καὶ τὰ προκείμενα τῆς χώρας ὄρη κατέχοντας βλαβεροὺς μὲν τοῖς πολεμίοις εἶναι, μεγάλην δὲ προβολὴν τοῖς πολίταις τῆς χώρας κατεσκευάσθαι;  
And don’t you think that active young Athenians, more lightly armed and occupying the mountains that protect our country, would prove a thorn in the side of the enemy and a strong bulwark of defence to our people?

1172	καὶ ὁ Περικλῆς, πάντ’ οἶμαι, ἔφη, ὦ Σωκράτες, καὶ ταῦτα χρήσιμα εἶναι.  
Pericles replied, I think all these suggestions too have a practical value.

1173	εἰ τοίνυν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ἀρέσκει σοι ταῦτα, ἐπιχείρει αὐτοῖς, ὦ ἄριστε·  
Then, since you like them, adopt them, my good fellow.

1174	ὅ τι μὲν γὰρ ἂν τούτων καταπράξῃς, καὶ σοὶ καλὸν ἔσται καὶ τῇ πόλει ἀγαθόν, ἐὰν δέ τι αὐτῶν ἀδυνατῇς, οὔτε τὴν πόλιν βλάψεις οὔτε σαυτὸν καταισχυνεῖς.  
Any part of them that you carry out will bring honour to you and good to the state; and should you fail in part, you will neither harm the state nor disgrace yourself.

1175	Γλαύκωνα δὲ τὸν Ἀρίστωνος, ὅτ’ ἐπεχείρει δημηγορεῖν, ἐπιθυμῶν προστατεύειν τῆς πόλεως οὐδέπω εἴκοσιν ἔτη γεγονώς, τῶν ἄλλων οἰκείων τε καὶ φίλων οὐδεὶς ἐδύνατο παῦσαι ἑλκόμενόν τε ἀπὸ τοῦ βήματος καὶ καταγέλαστον ὄντα·  
Ariston’s son, Glaucon, was attempting to become an orator and striving for headship in the state, though he was less than twenty years old; and none of his friends or relations could check him, though he would get himself dragged from the platform and make himself a laughing-stock.

1176	Σωκράτης δέ, εὔνους ὢν αὐτῷ διά τε Χαρμίδην τὸν Γλαύκωνος καὶ διὰ Πλάτωνα, μόνος ἔπαυσεν.  
Only Socrates, who took an interest in him for the sake of Plato and Glaucon’s son Charmides, managed to check him.

1177	ἐντυχὼν γὰρ αὐτῷ πρῶτον μὲν εἰς τὸ ἐθελῆσαι ἀκούειν τοιάδε λέξας κατέσχεν, ὦ Γλαύκων, ἔφη, προστατεύειν ἡμῖν διανενόησαι τῆς πόλεως;  
For once on meeting him, he stopped him and contrived to engage his attention by saying: “Glaucon, have you made up your mind to be our chief man in the state?”

1178	ἔγωγ’, ἔφη, ὦ Σώκρατες.  
“I have, Socrates.”

1179	νὴ Δί’, ἔφη, καλὸν γάρ, εἴπερ τι καὶ ἄλλο τῶν ἐν ἀνθρώποις.  
“Well, upon my word there’s no more honourable ambition in the world;

1180	δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι, ἐὰν τοῦτο διαπράξῃ, δυνατὸς μὲν ἔσει αὐτὸς τυγχάνειν ὅτου ἂν ἐπιθυμῇς, ἱκανὸς δὲ τοὺς φίλους ὠφελεῖν, ἐπαρεῖς δὲ τὸν πατρῷον οἶκον, αὐξήσεις δὲ τὴν πατρίδα, ὀνομαστὸς δ’ ἔσει πρῶτον μὲν ἐν τῇ πόλει, ἔπειτα ἐν τῇ Ἑλλάδι, ἴσως δ’, ὥσπερ Θεμιστοκλῆς, καὶ ἐν τοῖς βαρβάροις.”  
for obviously, if you gain your object, you will be able to get whatever you want, and you will have the means of helping your friends: you will lift up your father’s house and exalt your fatherland; and you will make a name for yourself first at home, later on in Greece, and possibly, like Themistocles, in foreign lands as well; wherever you go, you will be a man of mark.”

1181	ὅπου δ’ ἂν ᾖς, πανταχοῦ περίβλεπτος ἔσει.  
Wherever you go, you will be a man of mark.

1182	ταῦτ’ οὖν ἀκούων ὁ Γλαύκων ἐμεγαλύνετο καὶ ἡδέως παρέμενε.  
When Glaucon heard this, he felt proud and gladly lingered.

1183	μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα ὁ Σωκράτης, οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, τοῦτο μέν, ὦ Γλαύκων, δῆλον, ὅτι, εἴπερ τιμᾶσθαι βούλει, ὠφελητέα σοι ἡ πόλις ἐστί;  
Next Socrates asked, "Well, Glaucon, as you want to win honour, is it not obvious that you must benefit your city?"

1184	πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη.  
"Most certainly," he replied.

1185	πρὸς θεῶν, ἔφη, μὴ τοίνυν ἀποκρύψῃ, ἀλλ’ εἶπον ἡμῖν ἐκ τίνος ἄρξῃ τὴν πόλιν εὐεργετεῖν.  
"Pray don’t be reticent, then; but tell us how you propose to begin your services to the state."

1186	ἐπεὶ δὲ ὁ Γλαύκων διεσιώπησεν, ὡς ἂν τότε σκοπῶν ὁπόθεν ἄρχοιτο, ἆρ’ ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ὥσπερ φίλου οἶκον εἰ αὐξῆσαι βούλοιο, πλουσιώτερον αὐτὸν ἐπιχειροίης ἂν ποιεῖν, οὕτω καὶ τὴν πόλιν πειράσῃ πλουσιωτέραν ποιῆσαι;  
As Glaucon remained dumb, apparently considering for the first time how to begin, Socrates said, "If you wanted to add to a friend’s fortune, you would set about making him richer. Will you try, then, to make your city richer?"

1187	πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη.  
"Certainly," he said.

1188	οὐκοῦν πλουσιωτέρα γ’ ἂν εἴη προσόδων αὐτῇ πλειόνων γενομένων;  
"Would she not be richer if she had a larger revenue?"

1189	εἰκὸς γοῦν, ἔφη.  
"Oh yes, presumably," he replied.

1190	λέξον δή, ἔφη, ἐκ τίνων νῦν αἱ πρόσοδοι τῇ πόλει καὶ πόσαι τινές εἰσι;  
"Now tell me, from what sources are the city’s revenues at present derived and what is their total?"

1191	δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι ἔσκεψαι, ἵνα, εἰ μέν τινες αὐτῶν ἐνδεῶς ἔχουσιν, ἐκπληρώσῃς, εἰ δὲ παραλείπονται, προσπορίσῃς.  
"No doubt you have gone into this matter, in order to raise the amount of any that are deficient and supply any that are lacking."

1192	ἀλλὰ μὰ Δί’, ἔφη ὁ Γλαύκων, ταῦτά γε οὐκ ἐπέσκεμμαι.  
"Certainly not," exclaimed Glaucon, "I haven’t gone into that."

1193	ἀλλ’ εἰ τοῦτο, ἔφη, παρέλιπες, τάς γε δαπάνας τῆς πόλεως ἡμῖν εἰπέ·  
"Well, if you have left that out, tell us the expenditure of the city."

1194	δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι καὶ τούτων τὰς περιττὰς ἀφαιρεῖν διανοῇ.  
"No doubt you intend to cut down any items that are excessive."

1195	ἀλλὰ μὰ τὸν Δί’, ἔφη, οὐδὲ πρὸς ταῦτά πω ἐσχόλασα.  
"The fact is, I haven’t had time yet for that either."

1196	οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, τὸ μὲν πλουσιωτέραν τὴν πόλιν ποιεῖν ἀναβαλούμεθα·  
"Oh, then we will postpone the business of making the city richer;"

1197	πῶς γὰρ οἷόν τε μὴ εἰδότα γε τὰ ἀναλώματα καὶ τὰς προσόδους ἐπιμεληθῆναι τούτων;  
"for how is it possible to look after income and expenditure without knowing what they are?"

1198	ἀλλ’, ὦ Σώκρατες, ἔφη ὁ Γλαύκων, δυνατόν ἐστι καὶ ἀπὸ πολεμίων τὴν πόλιν πλουτίζειν.  
"Well, Socrates, one can make our enemies contribute to the city’s wealth."

1199	νὴ Δία σφόδρα γ’, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, ἐάν τις αὐτῶν κρείττων ᾖ·  
"Yes, of course, provided he is stronger than they;"

1200	ἥττων δὲ ὢν καὶ τὰ ὄντα προσαποβάλοι ἄν.  
"but if he be weaker, he may lose what she has got instead."

1201	ἀληθῆ λέγεις, ἔφη.  
"True," he said.
