Greek: 186 ἐπεὶ τοίνυν τάχιστα τῶν πολιτευομένων ὑπέλαβον κρείττονες εἶναι, Σωκράτει μὲν οὐκέτι προσῇσαν ·
English: So soon, then, as they presumed themselves to be the superiors of the politicians, they no longer came near Socrates.

Greek: 187 οὔτε γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἄλλως ἤρεσκεν, εἴ τε προσέλθοιεν, ὑπὲρ ὧν ἡμάρτανον ἐλεγχόμενοι ἤχθοντο ·
English: For apart from their general want of sympathy with him, they resented being cross-examined about their errors when they came.

Greek: 188 τὰ δὲ τῆς πόλεως ἔπραττον, ὧνπερ ἕνεκεν καὶ Σωκράτει προσῆλθον.
English: Politics had brought them to Socrates, and for politics they left him.

Greek: 189 ἀλλὰ Κρίτων τε Σωκράτους ἦν ὁμιλητὴς καὶ Χαιρεφῶν καὶ Χαιρεκράτης καὶ Ἑρμογένης καὶ Σιμμίας καὶ Κέβης καὶ Φαιδώνδας καὶ ἄλλοι, οἳ ἐκείνῳ συνῆσαν, οὐχ ἵνα δημηγορικοὶ ἢ δικανικοὶ γένοιντο, ἀλλ’ ἵνα καλοί τε κ- ἀγαθοὶ γενόμενοι καὶ οἴκῳ καὶ οἰκέταις καὶ οἰκείοις καὶ φίλοις καὶ πόλει καὶ πολίταις δύναιντο καλῶς χρῆσθαι.
English: But Criton was a true associate of Socrates, as were Chaerophon, Chaerecrates, Hermogenes, Simmias, Cebes, Phaedondas, and others who consorted with him not that they might shine in the courts or the assembly, but that they might become gentlemen, and be able to do their duty by house and household, and relatives and friends, and city and citizens.

Greek: 190 καὶ τούτων οὐδεὶς οὔτε νεώτερος οὔτε πρεσβύτερος ὢν οὔτ’ ἐποίησε κακὸν οὐδὲν οὔτ’ αἰτίαν ἔσχεν.
English: Of these not one, in his youth or old age, did evil or incurred censure.

Greek: 191 ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε, ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος, τοὺς πατέρας προπηλακίζειν ἐδίδασκε, πείθων μὲν τοὺς συνόντας αὐτῷ σοφωτέρους ποιεῖν τῶν πατέρων, φάσκων δὲ κατὰ νόμον ἐξεῖναι παρανοίας ἑλόντι καὶ τὸν πατέρα δῆσαι, τεκμηρίῳ τούτῳ χρώμενος, ὡς τὸν ἀμαθέστερον ὑπὸ τοῦ σοφωτέρου νόμιμον εἴη δεδέσθαι.
English: But, said his accuser, Socrates taught sons to treat their fathers with contempt: he persuaded them that he made his companions wiser than their fathers: he said that the law allowed a son to put his father in prison if he convinced a jury that he was insane; and this was a proof that it was lawful for the wiser to keep the more ignorant in gaol.

Greek: 192 Σωκράτης δὲ τὸν μὲν ἀμαθίας ἕνεκα δεσμεύοντα δικαίως ἂν καὶ αὐτὸν ᾤετο δεδέσθαι ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπισταμένων ἃ μὴ αὐτὸς ἐπίσταται;
English: In reality Socrates held that, if you clap fetters on a man for his ignorance, you deserve to be kept in gaol yourself by those whose knowledge is greater than your own.

Greek: 193 καὶ τῶν τοιούτων ἕνεκα πολλάκις ἐσκόπει, τί διαφέρει μανίας ἀμαθία;
English: And such reasoning led him frequently to consider the difference between Madness and Ignorance.

Greek: 194 καὶ τοὺς μὲν μαινομένους ᾤετο συμφερόντως ἂν δεδέσθαι καὶ ἑαυτοῖς καὶ τοῖς φίλοις, τοὺς δὲ μὴ ἐπισταμένους τὰ δέοντα δικαίως ἂν μανθάνειν παρὰ τῶν ἐπισταμένων.
English: That madmen should be kept in prison was expedient, he thought, both for themselves and for their friends: but those who are ignorant of what they ought to know deserve to learn from those who know it.

Greek: 195 ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε, ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος, οὐ μόνον τοὺς πατέρας ἀλλὰ καὶ τοὺς ἄλλους συγγενεῖς ἐποίει ἐν ἀτιμίᾳ εἶναι παρὰ τοῖς ἑαυτῷ συνοῦσι, λέγων ὡς οὔτε τοὺς κάμνοντας οὔτε τοὺς δικαζομένους οἱ συγγενεῖς ὠφελοῦσιν, ἀλλὰ τοὺς μὲν οἱ ἰατροί, τοὺς δὲ οἱ συνδικεῖν ἐπιστάμενοι.
English: But, said his accuser, Socrates caused his companions to dishonour not only their fathers, but their other relations as well, by saying that invalids and litigants get benefit not from their relations, but from their doctor or their counsel.

Greek: 196 ἔφη δὲ καὶ περὶ τῶν φίλων αὐτὸν λέγειν ὡς οὐδὲν ὄφελος εὔνους εἶναι, εἰ μὴ καὶ ὠφελεῖν δυνήσονται.
English: Of friends too he said that their goodwill was worthless, unless they could combine with it some power to help one.

Greek: 197 μόνους δὲ φάσκειν αὐτὸν ἀξίους εἶναι τιμῆς τοὺς εἰδότας τὰ δέοντα καὶ ἑρμηνεῦσαι δυναμένους.
English: Only those deserved honour who knew what was the right thing to do, and could explain it.

Greek: 198 ἀναπείθοντα οὖν τοὺς νέους αὐτόν, ὡς αὐτὸς εἴη σοφώτατός τε καὶ ἄλλους ἱκανώτατος ποιῆσαι σοφούς, οὕτω διατιθέναι τοὺς ἑαυτῷ συνόντας, ὥστε μηδαμοῦ παρ' αὐτοῖς τοὺς ἄλλους εἶναι πρὸς ἑαυτόν.
English: Thus by leading the young to think that he excelled in wisdom and in ability to make others wise, he had such an effect on his companions that no one counted for anything in their estimation in comparison with him.

Greek: 199 ἐγὼ δ' αὐτὸν οἶδα μὲν καὶ περὶ πατέρων τε καὶ τῶν ἄλλων συγγενῶν τε καὶ περὶ φίλων ταῦτα λέγοντα.
English: Now I know that he did use this

 language about fathers, relations and friends.

Greek: 200 καὶ πρὸς τούτοις γε δή, ὅτι τῆς ψυχῆς ἐξελθούσης, ἐν ᾗ μόνῃ γίγνεται φρόνησις, τὸ σῶμα τοῦ οἰκειοτάτου ἀνθρώπου τὴν ταχίστην ἐξενέγκαντες ἀφανίζουσιν.
English: And, what is more, he would say that so soon as the soul, the only seat of intelligence, is gone out of a man, even though he be our nearest and dearest, we carry out his body and hide it in the tomb.

Greek: 201 ἔλεγε δ' ὅτι καὶ ζῶν ἕκαστος ἑαυτοῦ, ὃ πάντων μάλιστα φιλεῖ, τοῦ σώματος ὅ τι ἂν ἀχρεῖον ᾖ καὶ ἀνωφελές, αὐτός τε ἀφαιρεῖ καὶ ἄλλῳ παρέχει.
English: Moreover, a man’s dearest friend is himself: yet, even in his lifetime he removes or lets another remove from his body whatever is useless and unprofitable.

Greek: 202 αὐτοί τέ γε αὑτῶν ὄνυχάς τε καὶ τρίχας καὶ τύλους ἀφαιροῦσι καὶ τοῖς ἰατροῖς παρέχουσι μετὰ πόνων τε καὶ ἀλγηδόνων καὶ ἀποτέμνειν καὶ ἀποκάειν, καὶ τούτων χάριν οἴονται δεῖν αὐτοῖς καὶ μισθὸν τίνειν.
English: He removes his own nails, hair, corns: he lets the surgeon cut and cauterize him, and, aches and pains notwithstanding, feels bound to thank and fee him for it.

Greek: 203 καὶ τὸ σίαλον ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ἀποπτύουσιν ὡς δύνανται πορρωτάτω, διότι ὠφελεῖ μὲν οὐδὲν αὐτοὺς ἐνόν, βλάπτει δὲ πολὺ μᾶλλον.
English: He spits out the saliva from his mouth as far away as he can, because to retain it doesn’t help him, but harms him rather.

Greek: 204 ταῦτ' οὖν ἔλεγεν οὐ τὸν μὲν πατέρα ζῶντα κατορύττειν διδάσκων, ἑαυτὸν δὲ κατατέμνειν, ἀλλ' ἐπιδεικνύων ὅτι τὸ ἄφρον ἄτιμόν ἐστι παρεκάλει ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τοῦ ὡς φρονιμώτατον εἶναι καὶ ὠφελιμώτατον, ὅπως, ἐάν τε ὑπὸ πατρὸς ἐάν τε ὑπὸ ἀδελφοῦ ἐάν τε ὑπ' ἄλλου τινὸς βούληται τιμᾶσθαι, μὴ τῷ οἰκεῖος εἶναι πιστεύων ἀμελῇ, ἀλλὰ πειρᾶται, ὑφ' ὧν ἂν βούληται τιμᾶσθαι, τούτοις ὠφέλιμος εἶναι.
English: Now in saying all this, he was not giving a lesson on the duty of burying one’s father alive, or making mincemeat of one’s body: he meant to show that unreason is unworth, and was urging the necessity of cultivating sound sense and usefulness, in order that he who would fain be valued by father or by brother or by anyone else may not rely on the bond of familiarity and neglect him, but may try to be useful to all those by whom he would be valued.

Greek: 205 ἔφη δ’ αὐτὸν ὁ κατήγορος καὶ τῶν ἐνδοξοτάτων ποιητῶν ἐκλεγόμενον τὰ πονηρότατα καὶ τούτοις μαρτυρίοις χρώμενον διδάσκειν τοὺς συνόντας κακούργους τε εἶναι καὶ τυραννικούς, Ἡσιόδου μὲν τὸ ἔργον δ’ οὐδὲν ὄνειδος, ἀεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος.
English: Again, his accuser alleged that he selected from the most famous poets the most immoral passages, and used them as evidence in teaching his companions to be tyrants and malefactors: for example, Hesiod’s line: "No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace."

Greek: 206 τοῦτο δὴ λέγειν αὐτόν, ὡς ὁ ποιητὴς κελεύει μηδενὸς ἔργου μήτ’ ἀδίκου μήτ’ αἰσχροῦ ἀπέχεσθαι, ἀλλὰ καὶ ταῦτα ποιεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ κέρδει.
English: He was charged with explaining this line as an injunction to refrain from no work, dishonest or disgraceful, but to do anything for gain.

Greek: 207 Σωκράτης δ’ ἐπεὶ διομολογήσαιτο τὸ μὲν ἐργάτην εἶναι ὠφέλιμόν τε ἀνθρώπῳ καὶ ἀγαθὸν εἶναι, τὸ δὲ ἀργὸν βλαβερόν τε καὶ κακόν, καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐργάζεσθαι ἀγαθόν, τὸ δ’ ἀργεῖν κακόν, τοὺς μὲν ἀγαθόν τι ποιοῦντας ἐργάζεσθαί τε ἔφη καὶ ἐργάτας ἀγαθοὺς εἶναι, τοὺς δὲ κυβεύοντας ἤ τι ἄλλο πονηρὸν καὶ ἐπιζήμιον ποιοῦντας ἀργοὺς ἀπεκάλει.
English: Now, though Socrates would fully agree that it is a benefit and a blessing to a man to be a worker, and a disadvantage and an evil to be an idler — that work, in fact, is a blessing, idleness an evil — working, being a worker, meant to him doing good work; but gambling and any occupation that is immoral and leads to loss he called idling. 

Greek: 208 ἐκ δὲ τούτων ὀρθῶς ἂν ἔχοι τὸ ἔργον δ’ οὐδὲν ὄνειδο

ς, ἀεργίη δέ τ’ ὄνειδος.
English: When thus interpreted there is nothing amiss with the line: "No work is a disgrace, but idleness is a disgrace."

Greek: 209 τὸ δὲ Ὀμήρου ἔφη ὁ κατήγορος πολλάκις αὐτὸν λέγειν, ὅτι Ὀδυσσεὺς ὅντινα μὲν βασιλῆα καὶ ἔξοχον ἄνδρα κιχείη, τὸν δ’ ἀγανοῖς ἐπέεσσιν ἐρητύσασκε παραστάς.
English: Again, his accuser said that he often quoted the passage from Homer, showing how Odysseus: "Whenever he found one that was a captain and a man of mark, stood by his side, and restrained him with gentle words."

Greek: 210 δαιμόνι’, οὔ σε ἔοικε κακὸν ὣς δειδίσσεσθαι, ἀλλ’ αὐτός τε κάθησο καὶ ἄλλους ἵδρυε λαούς.
211 ὃν δ’ αὖ δήμου τ’ ἄνδρα ἴδοι βοόωντά τ’ ἐφεύροι, τὸν σκήπτρῳ ἐλάσασκεν ὁμοκλήσασκέ τε μύθῳ.
212 δαιμόνι’, ἀτρέμας ἧσο, καὶ ἄλλων μῦθον ἄκουε, οἳ σέο φέρτεροί εἰσι. σὺ δ’ ἀπτόλεμος καὶ ἄναλκις, οὔτε ποτ’ ἐν πολέμῳ ἐναρίθμιος οὔτ’ ἐνὶ βουλῇ.
English: But whatever man of the people he saw and found him shouting, him he drove with his sceptre and chid him with loud words: "Good sir, sit still and hearken to the words of others that are thy betters: but thou art no warrior and a weakling, never reckoned whether in battle or in council."

Greek: 213 σὺ δ’ ἀπτόλεμος καὶ ἄναλκις, οὔτε ποτ’ ἐν πολέμῳ ἐναρίθμιος οὔτ’ ἐνὶ βουλῇ.
214 ταῦτα δὴ αὐτὸν ἐξηγεῖσθαι, ὡς ὁ ποιητὴς ἐπαινοίη παίεσθαι τοὺς δημότας καὶ πένητας.
English: This passage, it was said, he explained to mean that the poet approved of chastising common and poor folk.

Greek: 215	Σωκράτης δ’ οὐ ταῦτ’ ἔλεγε ·
English: But Socrates never said that.

Greek: 216	καὶ γὰρ ἑαυτὸν οὕτω γ’ ἂν ᾤετο δεῖν παίεσθαι ·
English: Indeed, on that view he would have thought himself worthy of chastisement.

Greek: 217	ἀλλ’ ἔφη δεῖν τοὺς μήτε λόγῳ μήτ’ ἔργῳ ὠφελίμους ὄντας μήτε στρατεύματι μήτε πόλει μήτε αὐτῷ τῷ δήμῳ, εἴ τι δέοι, βοηθεῖν ἱκανούς, ἄλλως τ’ ἐὰν πρὸς τούτῳ καὶ θρασεῖς ὦσι, πάντα τρόπον κωλύεσθαι, κἂν πάνυ πλούσιοι τυγχάνωσιν ὄντες.
English: But what he did say was that those who render no service either by word or deed, who cannot help army or city or the people itself in time of need, ought to be stopped, even if they have riches in abundance, especially if they are insolent as well as inefficient.

Greek: 218	ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε τ- ἐναντία τούτων φανερὸς ἦν καὶ δημοτικὸς καὶ φιλάνθρωπος ὤν.
English: But Socrates was just the opposite of all that, showing himself to be one of the people and a friend of mankind.

Greek: 219	ἐκεῖνος γὰρ πολλοὺς ἐπιθυμητὰς καὶ ἀστοὺς καὶ ξένους λαβὼν οὐδένα πώποτε μισθὸν τῆς συνουσίας ἐπράξατο, ἀλλὰ πᾶσιν ἀφθόνως ἐπήρκει τῶν ἑαυτοῦ ·
English: For although he had many eager disciples among citizens and strangers, yet he never exacted a fee for his society from one of them, but of his abundance he gave without stint to all.

Greek: 220	ὧν τινες μικρὰ μέρη παρ’ ἐκείνου προῖκα λαβόντες πολλοῦ τοῖς ἄλλοις ἐπώλουν, καὶ οὐκ ἦσαν ὥσπερ ἐκεῖνος δημοτικοί ·
English: Some indeed, after getting from him a few trifles for nothing, became vendors of them at a great price to others.

Greek: 221	τοῖς γὰρ μὴ ἔχουσι χρήματα διδόναι οὐκ ἤθελον διαλέγεσθαι.
English:  For they showed none of his sympathy with the people, refusing to talk with those who had no money to give them.

Greek: 222	ἀλλὰ Σωκράτης γε καὶ πρὸς τοὺς ἄλλους ἀνθρώπους κόσμον τῇ πόλει παρεῖχε πολλῷ μᾶλλον ἢ Λίχας τῇ Λακεδαιμονίων, ὃς ὀνομαστὸς ἐπὶ τούτῳ γέγονε.
English: But Socrates did far more to win respect for the State in the world at large than Lichas, whose services to Sparta have made his name immortal. 

Greek: 223	Λίχας μὲν γὰρ ταῖς γυμνοπαιδίαις τοὺς ἐπιδημοῦντας ἐν Λακεδαίμονι ξένους ἐδείπνιζε, Σωκράτης δὲ διὰ παντὸς τοῦ βίου τὰ ἑαυτοῦ δαπανῶν τὰ μέγιστα πάντας τοὺς βουλομένους ὠφέλει.
English: For Lichas used to entertain the strangers staying at Sparta during the Feast of the Dancing Boys; but Socrates spent his life in lavishing his gifts and rendering the greatest services to all who cared to receive them.

Greek: 224	βελτίους γὰρ ποιῶν τοὺς συγγιγνομένους ἀπέπεμπεν.
English: For he always made his associates better men before he parted with them.

Greek: 225	ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ Σωκράτης τοιοῦτος ὢν ἐδόκει τιμῆς ἄξιος εἶναι τῇ πόλει μᾶλλον ἢ θανάτου.
English: To me, he seemed to deserve honour rather than death at the hands of the State.

Greek: 226	καὶ κατὰ τοὺς νόμους δὲ σκοπῶν ἄν τις τοῦθ’ εὕροι.
English: And a consideration of his case in its legal aspect will confirm my opinion.

Greek: 227	κατὰ γὰρ τοὺς νόμους, ἐάν τις φανερὸς γένηται κλέπτων ἢ λωποδυτῶν ἢ βαλλαντιοτομῶν ἢ τοιχωρυχῶν ἢ ἀνδραποδιζόμενος ἢ ἱεροσυλῶν, τούτοις θάνατός ἐστιν ἡ ζημία.
English: Under the laws, death is the penalty inflicted on persons proved to be thieves, highwaymen, cutpurses, kidnappers, robbers of temples.

Greek: 228	ὧν ἐκεῖνος πάντων ἀνθρώπων πλεῖστον ἀπεῖχεν.
English: And from such criminals no man was so widely separated as he.

Greek: 229	ἀλλὰ μὴν τῇ πόλει γε οὔτε πολέμου κακῶς συμβάντος οὔτε στάσεως οὔτε προδοσίας οὔτε ἄλλου κακοῦ οὐδενὸς πώποτε αἴτιος ἐγένετο.
English: Moreover, to the State he was never the cause of disaster in war, or strife or treason or any evil whatever.

Greek: 230	οὐδὲ μὴν ἰδίᾳ γε οὐδένα πώποτε ἀνθρώπων οὔτε ἀγαθῶν ἀπεστέρησεν οὔτε κακοῖς περιέβαλεν, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ αἰτίαν τῶν εἰρημένων οὐδενὸς πώποτ’ ἔσχε.
English: Again, in private life no man by him was ever deprived of good or involved in ill. None of these crimes was ever so much as imputed to him. 

Greek: 231	πῶς οὖν ἂν ἔνοχος εἴη τῇ γραφῇ;
English: How then could he be guilty of the charges?

Greek: 232	ὃς ἀντὶ μὲν τοῦ μὴ νομίζειν θεούς, ὡς ἐν τῇ γραφῇ ἐγέγραπτο, φανερὸς ἦν θεραπεύων τοὺς θεοὺς μάλιστα τῶν ἄλλων ἀνθρώπων, ἀντὶ δὲ τοῦ διαφθείρειν τοὺς νέους, ὃ δὴ ὁ γραψάμενος αὐτὸν ᾐτιᾶτο, φανερὸς ἦν τῶν συνόντων τοὺς πονηρὰς ἐπιθυμίας ἔχοντας τούτων μὲν παύων, τῆς δὲ καλλίστης καὶ μεγαλοπρεπεστάτης ἀρετῆς, ᾗ πόλεις τε καὶ οἶκοι εὖ οἰκοῦσι, προτρέπων ἐπιθυμεῖν.
English: For so far was he from rejecting the gods, as charged in the indictment, that no man was more conspicuous for his devotion to the service of the gods: so far from corrupting the youth, as his accuser actually charged against him, that if any among his companions had evil desires, he openly tried to reform them and exhorted them to desire the fairest and noblest virtue, by which men prosper in public life and in their homes.

Greek: 233	ταῦτα δὲ πράττων πῶς οὐ μεγάλης ἄξιος ἦν τιμῆς τῇ πόλει;
English: By this conduct did he not deserve high honour from the State?

Greek: 234	ὡς δὲ δὴ καὶ ὠφελεῖν ἐδόκει μοι τοὺς συνόντας τὰ μὲν ἔργῳ δεικνύων ἑαυτὸν οἷος ἦν, τὰ δὲ καὶ διαλεγόμενος, τούτων δὴ γράψω ὁπόσα ἂν διαμνημονεύσω.
English: In order to support my opinion that he benefited his companions, alike by actions that revealed his own character and by his conversation, I will set down what I recollect of these.

Greek: 235	τὰ μὲν τοίνυν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς φανερὸς ἦν καὶ ποιῶν καὶ λέγων ᾗπερ ἡ Πυθία ἀποκρίνεται τοῖς ἐρωτῶσι πῶς δεῖ ποιεῖν ἢ περὶ θυσίας ἢ περὶ προγόνων θεραπείας ἢ περὶ ἄλλου τινὸς τῶν τοιούτων.
English: First, then, for his attitude towards religion; his deeds and words were clearly in harmony with the answer given by the Priestess at Delphi to such questions as "What is my duty about sacrifice?" or about "cult of ancestors."

Greek: 236	ἥ τε γὰρ Πυθία νόμῳ πόλεως ἀναιρεῖ ποιοῦντας εὐσεβῶς ἂν ποιεῖν, Σωκράτης τε οὕτω καὶ αὐτὸς ἐποίει καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις παρῄνει, τοὺς δὲ ἄλλως πως ποιοῦντας περιέργους καὶ ματαίους ἐνόμιζεν εἶναι.
English: For the answer of the Priestess is, "Follow the custom of the State: that is the way to act piously." And so Socrates acted himself and counselled others to act. To take any other course he considered presumption and folly.

Greek: 237	καὶ ηὔχετο δὲ πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς ἁπλῶς τ- ἀγαθὰ διδόναι, ὡς τοὺς θεοὺς κάλλιστα εἰδότας ὁποῖα ἀγαθά ἐστι.
English: And again, when he prayed he asked simply for good gifts, "for the gods know best what things are good."

Greek: 238	τοὺς δ’ εὐχομένους χρυσίον ἢ ἀργύριον ἢ τυραννίδα ἢ ἄλλο τι τῶν τοιούτων οὐδὲν διάφορον ἐνόμιζεν εὔχεσθαι ἢ εἰ κυβείαν ἢ μάχην ἢ ἄλλο τι εὔχοιντο τῶν φανερῶς ἀδήλων ὅπως ἀποβήσοιτο.
English: To pray for gold or silver or sovereignty or any other such thing, was just like praying for a gamble or a fight or anything of which the result is obviously uncertain.

Greek: 239	θυσίας δὲ θύων μικρὰς ἀπὸ μικρῶν οὐδὲν ἡγεῖτο μειοῦσθαι τῶν ἀπὸ πολλῶν καὶ μεγάλων πολλὰ καὶ μεγάλα θυόντων.
English: Though his sacrifices were humble, according to his means, he thought himself not a whit inferior to those who made frequent and magnificent sacrifices out of great possessions.

Greek: 240	οὔτε γὰρ τοῖς θεοῖς ἔφη καλῶς ἔχειν, εἰ ταῖς μεγάλαις θυσίαις μᾶλλον ἢ ταῖς μικραῖς ἔχαιρον.
English: The gods (he said) could not well delight more in great offerings than in small.

Greek: 241	πολλάκις γὰρ ἂν αὐτοῖς τὰ παρὰ τῶν πονηρῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν χρηστῶν εἶναι κεχαρισμένα.
English: For in that case must the gifts of the wicked often have found more favour in their sight than the gifts of the upright.

Greek: 242	οὔτ’ ἂν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἄξιον εἶναι ζῆν, εἰ τὰ παρὰ τῶν πονηρῶν μᾶλλον ἦν κεχαρισμένα τοῖς θεοῖς ἢ τὰ παρὰ τῶν χρηστῶν.
English: And man would not find life worth having, if the gifts of the wicked were received with more favour by the gods than the gifts of the upright.

Greek: 243	ἀλλ’ ἐνόμιζε τοὺς θεοὺς ταῖς παρὰ τῶν εὐσεβεστάτων τιμαῖς μάλιστα χαίρειν.
English: No, the greater the piety of the giver, the greater (he thought) was the delight of the gods in the gift.

Greek: 244	ἐπαινέτης δ’ ἦν καὶ τοῦ ἔπους τούτου ·
English: He would quote with approval the line.

Greek: 245	καδδύναμιν δ’ ἔρδειν ἱέρ’ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι, καὶ πρὸς φίλους δὲ καὶ ξένους καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἄλλην δίαιταν καλὴν ἔφη παραίνεσιν εἶναι τὴν καδδύναμιν δ’ ἔρδειν.
English: "According to thy power render sacrifice to the immortal gods," and he would add that in our treatment of friends and strangers, and in all our behaviour, it is a noble principle to render according to our power.

Greek: 246	εἰ δέ τι δόξειεν αὐτῷ σημαίνεσθαι παρὰ τῶν θεῶν, ἧττον ἂν ἐπείσθη παρὰ τὰ σημαινόμενα ποιῆσαι ἢ εἴ τις αὐτὸν ἔπειθεν ὁδοῦ λαβεῖν ἡγεμόνα τυφλὸν καὶ μὴ εἰδότα τὴν ὁδὸν ἀντὶ βλέποντος καὶ εἰδότος.
English: If ever any warning seemed to be given him from heaven, he would more easily have been persuaded to choose a blind guide who did not know the road in preference to one who could see and knew the way, than to disregard the admonition.

Greek: 247	καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δὲ μωρίαν κατηγόρει, οἵτινες παρὰ τὰ ὑπὸ τῶν θεῶν σημαινόμενα ποιοῦσί τι, φυλαττόμενοι τὴν παρὰ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἀδοξίαν.
English: All men, in fact, who flouted the warnings of the gods in their anxiety to avoid the censure of men, he denounced for their foolishness.

Greek: 248	αὐτὸς δὲ πάντα τ- ἀνθρώπινα ὑπερεώρα πρὸς τὴν παρὰ τῶν θεῶν συμβουλίαν.
English: He himself despised all human opinions in comparison with counsel given by the gods.

Greek: 249	διαίτῃ δὲ τήν τε ψυχὴν ἐπαίδευσε καὶ τὸ σῶμα ᾗ χρώμενος ἄν τις, εἰ μή τι δαιμόνιον εἴη, θαρραλέως καὶ ἀσφαλῶς διάγοι καὶ οὐκ ἂν ἀπορήσειε τοσαύτης δαπάνης.
English: He schooled his body and soul by following a system which, in all human calculation, would give him a life of confidence and security, and would make it easy to meet his expenses.

Greek: 250	οὕτω γὰρ εὐτελὴς ἦν, ὥστ’ οὐκ οἶδ’ εἴ τις οὕτως ἂν ὀλίγα ἐργάζοιτο ὥστε μὴ λαμβάνειν τὰ Σωκράτει ἀρκοῦντα.
English: For he was so frugal that it is hardly possible to imagine a man doing so little work as not to earn enough to satisfy the needs of Socrates.

Greek: 251	σίτῳ μὲν γὰρ τοσούτῳ ἐχρῆτο, ὅσον ἡδέως ἤσθιε, καὶ ἐπὶ τοῦτο οὕτω παρεσκευασμένος ᾔει ὥστε τὴν ἐπιθυμίαν τοῦ σίτου ὄψον αὐτῷ εἶναι.
English: He ate just sufficient food to make eating a pleasure, and he was so ready for his food that he found appetite the best sauce.

Greek: 252	ποτὸν δὲ πᾶν ἡδὺ ἦν αὐτῷ διὰ τὸ μὴ πίνειν, εἰ μὴ διψῴη.
English: And any kind of drink he found pleasant, because he drank only when he was thirsty.

Greek: 253	εἰ δέ ποτε κληθεὶς ἐθελήσειεν ἐπὶ δεῖπνον ἐλθεῖν, ὃ τοῖς πλείστοις ἐργωδέστατόν ἐστιν, ὥστε φυλάξασθαι τὸ ὑπὲρ τὸν κόρον ἐμπίμπλασθαι, τοῦτο ῥᾳδίως πάνυ ἐφυλάττετο.
English: Whenever he accepted an invitation to dinner, he resisted without difficulty the common temptation to exceed the limit of satiety.

Greek: 254	τοῖς δὲ μὴ δυναμένοις τοῦτο ποιεῖν συνεβούλευε φυλάττεσθαι τὰ πείθοντα μὴ πεινῶντας ἐσθίειν μηδὲ διψῶντας πίνειν.
English: And he advised those who could not do likewise to

 avoid appetizers that encouraged them to eat and drink what they did not want.

Greek: 255	καὶ γὰρ τὰ λυμαινόμενα γαστέρας καὶ κεφαλὰς καὶ ψυχὰς ταῦτ’ ἔφη εἶναι.
English: For such trash was the ruin of stomach and brain and soul.

Greek: 256	οἴεσθαι δ’ ἔφη ἐπισκώπτων καὶ τὴν Κίρκην ὗς ποιεῖν τοιούτοις πολλοῖς δειπνίζουσαν.
English: I believe, he said in jest, it was by providing a feast of such things that Circe made swine.

Greek: 257	τὸν δὲ Ὀδυσσέα Ἑρμοῦ τε ὑποθημοσύνῃ καὶ αὐτὸν ἐγκρατῆ ὄντα καὶ ἀποσχόμενον τοῦ ὑπὲρ τὸν κόρον τῶν τοιούτων ἅπτεσθαι, διὰ ταῦτα οὐ γενέσθαι ὗν.
English: And it was partly by the prompting of Hermes, partly through his own self-restraint and avoidance of excessive indulgence in such things, that Odysseus was not turned into a pig.

Greek: 258	τοιαῦτα μὲν περὶ τούτων ἔπαιζεν ἅμα σπουδάζων.
English: This was how he would talk on the subject, half joking, half in earnest.

Greek: 259	ἀφροδισίων δὲ παρῄνει τῶν καλῶν ἰσχυρῶς ἀπέχεσθαι;
English: Of sensual passion he would say: "Avoid it resolutely: 

Greek: 260	οὐ γὰρ ἔφη ῥᾴδιον εἶναι τῶν τοιούτων ἁπτόμενον σωφρονεῖν.
English: it is not easy to control yourself once you meddle with that sort of thing."

Greek: 261	ἀλλὰ καὶ Κριτόβουλόν ποτε τὸν Κρίτωνος πυθόμενος ὅτι ἐφίλησε τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδου υἱὸν καλὸν ὄντα, παρόντος τοῦ Κριτοβούλου ἤρετο Ξενοφῶντα.
English: Thus, on hearing that Critobulus had kissed Alcibiades’ pretty boy, he put this question to Xenophon before Critobulus.

Greek: 262	εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Ξενοφῶν, οὐ σὺ Κριτόβουλον ἐνόμιζες εἶναι τῶν σωφρονικῶν ἀνθρώπων μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν θρασέων καὶ τῶν προνοητικῶν μᾶλλον ἢ τῶν ἀνοήτων τε καὶ ῥιψοκινδύνων;
English: "Tell me, Xenophon, did you not suppose Critobulus to be a sober person, and by no means rash; prudent, and not thoughtless or adventurous?"

Greek: 263	πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν.
English: "Certainly," said Xenophon.

Greek: 264	νῦν τοίνυν νόμιζε αὐτὸν θερμουργότατον εἶναι καὶ λεωργότατον.
English: "Then you are to look on him henceforth as utterly hot-headed and reckless."

Greek: 265	οὗτος κἂν εἰς μαχαίρας κυβιστήσειε κἂν εἰς πῦρ ἅλοιτο.
English: "The man would do a somersault into a ring of knives; he would jump into fire."

Greek: 266	καὶ τί δή, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, ἰδὼν ποιοῦντα τοιαῦτα κατέγνωκας αὐτοῦ;
English: "What on earth has he done to make you think so badly of him?" asked Xenophon.

Greek: 267	οὐ γὰρ οὗτος, ἔφη, ἐτόλμησε τὸν Ἀλκιβιάδου υἱὸν φιλῆσαι, ὄντα εὐπροσωπότατον καὶ ὡραιότατον?
English: "What has the man done? He dared to kiss Alcibiades’ son, and the boy is very good-looking and attractive."

Greek: 268	ἀλλ’ εἰ μέντοι, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, τοιοῦτόν ἐστι τὸ ῥιψοκίνδυνον ἔργον, κἂν ἐγὼ δοκῶ μοι τὸν κίνδυνον τοῦτον ὑπομεῖναι.
English: "Oh, if that is the sort of adventure you mean, I think I might make that venture myself."

Greek: 269	ὦ τλῆμον, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, καὶ τί ἂν οἴει παθεῖν καλὸν φιλήσας;
English: "What do you think will happen to you through kissing a pretty face?"

Greek: 270	ἆρ’ οὐκ ἂν αὐτίκα μάλα δοῦλος μὲν εἶναι ἀντ’ ἐλευθέρου, πολλὰ δὲ δαπανᾶν εἰς βλαβερὰς ἡδονάς, πολλὴν δὲ ἀσχολίαν ἔχειν τοῦ ἐπιμεληθῆναί τινος καλοῦ κ- ἀγαθοῦ, σπουδάζειν δ’ ἀναγκασθῆναι ἐφ’ οἷς οὐδ’ ἂν μαινόμενος σπουδάσειεν;
English: "Won’t you lose your liberty in a trice and become a slave, begin spending large sums on harmful pleasures, have no time to give to anything fit for a gentleman, be forced to concern yourself with things that no madman even would care about?"

Greek: 271	ὦ Ἡράκλεις, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν, ὡς δεινήν τινα λέγεις δύναμιν τοῦ φιλήματος εἶναι.
English: "Heracles! what alarming power in a kiss!" cried Xenophon.

Greek: 272	καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, θαυμάζεις;
English: "What? Does that surprise you?" continued Socrates.

Greek: 273	οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι τὰ φαλάγγια οὐδ’ ἡμιωβελιαῖα τὸ μέγεθος ὄντα προσαψάμενα μόνον τῷ στόματι ταῖς τε ὀδύναις ἐπιτρίβει τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ τοῦ φρονεῖν ἐξίστησι;
English: "Don’t you know that the scorpion, though smaller than a farthing, if it but fasten on the tongue, inflicts excruciating and maddening pain?"

Greek: 274	ναὶ μὰ Δί’, ἔφη ὁ Ξενοφῶν;  

Greek: 275	ἐνίησι γάρ τι τὰ φαλάγγια κατὰ τὸ δῆγμα.
English: "Yes, to be sure;
English: for the scorpion injects something by its bite," said Xenophon.

Greek: 276	ὦ μῶρε, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, τοὺς δὲ καλοὺς οὐκ οἴει φιλοῦντας ἐνιέναι τι, ὅτι σὺ οὐχ ὁρᾷς;
English: "And do you think, you foolish fellow, that the fair inject nothing when they kiss, just because you don’t see it?"

Greek: 277	οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι τοῦτο τὸ θηρίον, ὃ καλοῦσι καλὸν καὶ ὡραῖον, τοσούτῳ δεινότερόν ἐστι τῶν φαλαγγίων, ὅσῳ ἐκεῖνα μὲν ἁψάμενα, τοῦτο δὲ οὐδ’ ἁπτόμενον, ἐάν τις αὐτὸ θεᾶται, ἐνίησί τι καὶ πάνυ πρόσωθεν τοιοῦτον ὥστε μαίνεσθαι ποιεῖν;
English: "Don’t you know that this creature called ‘fair and young’ is more dangerous than the scorpion, seeing that it need not even come in contact, like the insect, but at any distance can inject a maddening poison into anyone who only looks at it?"

Greek: 278	ἴσως δὲ καὶ οἱ ἔρωτες τοξόται διὰ τοῦτο καλοῦνται, ὅτι καὶ πρόσωθεν οἱ καλοὶ τιτρώσκουσιν.
English: "Maybe, too, the loves are called archers for this reason, that the fair can wound even at a distance."

Greek: 279	ἀλλὰ συμβουλεύω σοι, ὦ Ξενοφῶν, ὁπόταν ἴδῃς τινὰ καλόν, φεύγειν προτροπάδην.
English: "Nay, I advise you, Xenophon, as soon as you see a pretty face to take to your heels and fly."

Greek: 280	σοὶ δ’, ὦ Κριτόβουλε, συμβουλεύω ἀπενιαυτίσαι· 
English: "And you, Critobulus, I advise to spend a year abroad. 

Greek: 281	μόλις γὰρ ἂν ἴσως ἐν τοσούτῳ χρόνῳ τὸ δῆγμα ὑγιὴς γένοιο.
English: It will certainly take you at least as long as that to recover from the bite."

Greek: 282	οὕτω δὴ καὶ ἀφροδισιάζειν τοὺς μὴ ἀσφαλῶς ἔχοντας πρὸς ἀφροδίσια ᾤετο χρῆναι πρὸς τοιαῦτα , οἷα μὴ πάνυ μὲν δεομένου τοῦ σώματος οὐκ ἂν προσδέξαιτο ἡ ψυχή , δεομένου δὲ οὐκ ἂν πράγματα παρέχοι .
English: Thus in the matter of carnal appetite, he held that those whose passions were not under complete control should limit themselves to such indulgence as the soul would reject unless the need of the body were pressing, and such as would do no harm when the need was there.

Greek: 283	αὐτὸς δὲ πρὸς ταῦτα φανερὸς ἦν οὕτω παρεσκευασμένος ὥστε ῥᾷον ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν καλλίστων καὶ ὡραιοτάτων ἢ οἱ ἄλλοι τῶν αἰσχίστων καὶ ἀωροτάτων .
English: As for his own conduct in this matter, it was evident that he had trained himself to avoid the fairest and most attractive more easily than others avoid the ugliest and most repulsive.

Greek: 284	περὶ μὲν δὴ βρώσεως καὶ πόσεως καὶ ἀφροδισίων οὕτω κατεσκευασμένος ἦν καὶ ᾤετο οὐδὲν ἂν ἧττον ἀρκούντως ἥδεσθαι τῶν πολλὰ ἐπὶ τούτοις πραγματευομένων , λυπεῖσθαι δὲ πολὺ ἔλαττον .
English: Concerning eating and drinking then and carnal indulgence such were his views, and he thought that a due portion of pleasure would be no more lacking to him than to those who give themselves much to these, and that much less trouble would fall to his lot.

Greek: 285	εἰ δέ τινες Σωκράτην νομίζουσιν , ὡς ἔνιοι γράφουσί τε καὶ λέγουσι περὶ αὐτοῦ τεκμαιρόμενοι , προτρέψασθαι μὲν ἀνθρώπους ἐπ’ ἀρετὴν κράτιστον γεγονέναι , προαγαγεῖν δ’ ἐπ’ αὐτὴν οὐχ ἱκανόν , σκεψάμενοι μὴ μόνον ἃ ἐκεῖνος κολαστηρίου ἕνεκα τοὺς πάντ’ οἰομένους εἰδέναι ἐρωτῶν ἤλεγχεν , ἀλλὰ καὶ ἃ λέγων συνημέρευε τοῖς συνδιατρίβουσι , δοκιμαζόντων εἰ ἱκανὸς ἦν βελτίους ποιεῖν τοὺς συνόντας .
English: If any hold the opinion expressed in some written and spoken criticisms of Socrates that are based on inference, and think, that though he was consummate in exhorting men to virtue, he was an incompetent guide to it, let them consider not only the searching cross-examination with which he chastised those who thought themselves omniscient, but his daily talks with his familiar friends, and then judge whether he was capable of improving his companions.

Greek: 286	λέξω δὲ πρῶτον ἅ ποτε αὐτοῦ ἤκουσα περὶ τοῦ δαιμονίου διαλεγομένου πρὸς Ἀριστόδημον τὸν μικρὸν ἐπικαλούμενον .
English: I will first state what I once heard him say about the godhead in conversation with Aristodemus the dwarf, as he was called.

Greek: 287	καταμαθὼν γὰρ αὐτὸν οὔτε θύοντα τοῖς θεοῖς οὔτε μαντικῇ χρώμενον , ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν ποιούντων ταῦτα καταγελῶντα , εἰπέ μοι , ἔφη , ὦ Ἀριστόδημε , ἔστιν οὕστινας ἀνθρώπους τεθαύμακας ἐπὶ σοφίᾳ ;
English: On learning that he was not known to sacrifice or pray or use divination, and actually made a mock of those who did so, he said: Tell me, Aristodemus, do you admire any human beings for wisdom?

Greek: 288	ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη .
English: I do, he answered.

Greek: 289	καὶ ὅς , λέξον ἡμῖν , ἔφη , τὰ ὀνόματα αὐτῶν .
English: Tell us their names.

Greek: 290	ἐπὶ μὲν τοίνυν ἐπῶν ποιήσει Ὅμηρον ἔγωγε μάλιστα τεθαύμακα , ἐπὶ δὲ διθυράμβῳ Μελανιππίδην , ἐπὶ δὲ τραγῳδίᾳ Σοφοκλέα , ἐπὶ δὲ ἀνδριαντοποιίᾳ Πολύκλειτον , ἐπὶ δὲ ζωγραφίᾳ Ζεῦξιν .
English: In epic poetry Homer comes first, in my opinion; in dithyramb, Melanippides; in tragedy, Sophocles; in sculpture, Polycleitus; in painting, Zeuxis.

Greek: 291	πότερά σοι δοκοῦσιν οἱ ἀπεργαζόμενοι εἴδωλα ἄφρονά τε καὶ ἀκίνητα ἀξιοθαυμαστότεροι εἶναι ἢ οἱ ζῷα ἔμφρονά τε καὶ ἐνεργά;
English: Which, think you, deserve the greater admiration, the creators of phantoms without sense and motion, or the creators of living, intelligent, and active beings?

Greek: 292	πολὺ νὴ Δία οἱ ζῷα, εἴπερ γε μὴ τύχῃ τινί, ἀλλ’ ὑπὸ γνώμης ταῦτα γίγνεται.
English: Oh, of living beings, by far, provided only they are created by design and not mere chance.

Greek: 293	τῶν δὲ ἀτεκμάρτως ἐχόντων ὅτου ἕνεκα ἔστι καὶ τῶν φανερῶς ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ ὄντων πότερα τύχης καὶ πότερα γνώμης ἔργα κρίνεις;
English: Suppose that it is impossible to guess the purpose of one creature’s existence, and obvious that another’s serves a useful end, which, in your judgment, is the work of chance, and which of design?

Greek: 294	πρέπει μὲν τὰ ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ γιγνόμενα γνώμης εἶναι ἔργα.
English: Presumably the creature that serves some useful end is the work of design.

Greek: 295	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι ὁ ἐξ ἀρχῆς ποιῶν ἀνθρώπους ἐπ’ ὠφελείᾳ προσθεῖναι αὐτοῖς δι’ ὧν αἰσθάνονται ἕκαστα, ὀφθαλμοὺς μὲν ὥσθ’ ὁρᾶν τὰ ὁρατά, ὦτα δὲ ὥστ’ ἀκούειν τὰ ἀκουστά;
English: Do you not think then that he who created man from the beginning had some useful end in view when he endowed him with his several senses, giving eyes to see visible objects, ears to hear sounds?


Greek: 296 ὀσμῶν γε μήν, εἰ μὴ ῥῖνες προσετέθησαν, τί ἂν ἡμῖν ὄφελος ἦν;
English: Would odours again be of any use to us had we not been endowed with nostrils?

Greek: 297 τίς δ’ ἂν αἴσθησις ἦν γλυκέων καὶ δριμέων καὶ πάντων τῶν διὰ στόματος ἡδέων, εἰ μὴ γλῶττα τούτων γνώμων ἐνειργάσθη;
English: What perception should we have of sweet and bitter and all things pleasant to the palate had we no tongue in our mouth to discriminate between them?

Greek: 298 πρὸς δὲ τούτοις οὐ δοκεῖ σοι καὶ τάδε προνοίας ἔργοις ἐοικέναι, τὸ ἐπεὶ ἀσθενὴς μέν ἐστιν ἡ ὄψις, βλεφάροις αὐτὴν θυρῶσαι, ἅ, ὅταν μὲν αὐτῇ χρῆσθαί τι δέῃ, ἀναπετάννυται, ἐν δὲ τῷ ὕπνῳ συγκλείεται, ὡς δ’ ἂν μηδὲ ἄνεμοι βλάπτωσιν, ἡθμὸν βλεφαρίδας ἐμφῦσαι, ὀφρύσι τε ἀπογεισῶσαι τὰ ὑπὲρ τῶν ὀμμάτων, ὡς μηδ’ ὁ ἐκ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἱδρὼς κακουργῇ;
English: Besides these, are there not other contrivances that look like the results of forethought? Thus the eyeballs, being weak, are set behind eyelids, that open like doors when we want to see, and close when we sleep: on the lids grow lashes through which the very winds filter harmlessly: above the eyes is a coping of brows that lets no drop of sweat from the head hurt them.

Greek: 299 τὸ δὲ τὴν ἀκοὴν δέχεσθαι μὲν πάσας φωνάς, ἐμπίμπλασθαι δὲ μήποτε;
English: The ears catch all sounds, but are never choked with them.

Greek: 300 καὶ τοὺς μὲν πρόσθεν ὀδόντας πᾶσι ζῴοις οἵους τέμνειν εἶναι, τοὺς δὲ γομφίους οἵους παρὰ τούτων δεξαμένους λεαίνειν;
English: Again, the incisors of all creatures are adapted for cutting, the molars for receiving food from them and grinding it.

Greek: 301 καὶ στόμα μέν, δι’ οὗ ὧν ἐπιθυμεῖ τὰ ζῷα εἰσπέμπεται, πλησίον ὀφθαλμῶν καὶ ῥινῶν καταθεῖναι;
English: And again, the mouth, through which the food they want goes in, is set near the eyes and nostrils.

Greek: 302 ἐπεὶ δὲ τὰ ἀποχωροῦντα δυσχερῆ, ἀποστρέψαι τοὺς τούτων ὀχετοὺς καὶ ἀπενεγκεῖν ᾗ δυνατὸν προσωτάτω ἀπὸ τῶν αἰσθήσεων;
English: But since what goes out is unpleasant, the ducts through which it passes are turned away and removed as far as possible from the organs of sense.

Greek: 303 ταῦτα οὕτω προνοητικῶς πεπραγμένα ἀπορεῖς πότερα τύχης ἢ γνώμης ἔργα ἐστίν;
English: With such signs of forethought in these arrangements, can you doubt whether they are the works of chance or design?

Greek: 304 οὐ μὰ τὸν Δί’, ἔφη, ἀλλ’ οὕτω γε σκοπουμένῳ πάνυ ἔοικε ταῦτα σοφοῦ τινος δημιουργοῦ καὶ φιλοζῴου τεχνήμασι.
English: "No, of course not," he said, "but when I regard them in this light they do look very like the handiwork of a wise and loving creator."

Greek: 305 τὸ δὲ ἐμφῦσαι μὲν ἔρωτα τῆς τεκνοποιίας, ἐμφῦσαι δὲ ταῖς γειναμέναις ἔρωτα τοῦ ἐκτρέφειν, τοῖς δὲ τραφεῖσι μέγιστον μὲν πόθον τοῦ ζῆν, μέγιστον δὲ φόβον τοῦ θανάτου;
English: "What of the natural desire to beget children, the mother’s desire to rear her babe, the child’s strong will to live and strong fear of death?"

Greek: 306 ἀμέλει καὶ ταῦτα ἔοικε μηχανήμασί τινος ζῷα εἶναι βουλευσαμένου.
English: "Undoubtedly these, too, look like the contrivances of one who deliberately willed the existence of living creatures."

Greek: 307 σὺ δὲ σαυτῷ δοκεῖς τι φρόνιμον ἔχειν;
English: "Do you think you have any wisdom yourself?"

Greek: 308 ἐρώτα γοῦν καὶ ἀποκρινοῦμαι.
English: "Oh! Ask me a question and judge from my answer."

Greek: 309 ἄλλοθι δὲ οὐδαμοῦ οὐδὲν οἴει φρόνιμον εἶναι;
English: "And do you suppose that wisdom is nowhere else to be found,

Greek: 310 καὶ ταῦτ’ εἰδὼς ὅτι γῆς τε μικρὸν μέρος ἐν τῷ σώματι πολλῆς οὔσης ἔχεις καὶ ὑγροῦ βραχὺ πολλοῦ ὄντος καὶ τῶν ἄλλων δήπου μεγάλων ὄντων ἑκάστου μικρὸν μέρος λαβόντι τὸ σῶμα συνήρμοσταί σοι;
English:  although you know that you have a mere speck of all the earth in your body and a mere drop of all the water, and that of all the other mighty elements you received, I suppose, just a scrap towards the fashioning of your body?"


Greek: 311 νοῦν δὲ μόνον ἄρα οὐδαμοῦ ὄντα σε εὐτυχῶς πως δοκεῖς συναρπάσαι, καὶ τάδε τὰ ὑπερμεγέθη καὶ πλῆθος ἄπειρα δι’ ἀφροσύνην τινά, ὡς οἴει, εὐτάκτως ἔχειν;
English: "But as for mind, which alone, it seems, is without mass, do you think that you snapped it up by a lucky accident, and that the orderly ranks of all these huge masses, infinite in number, are due, forsooth, to a sort of absurdity?"


Greek: 312 μὰ Δί’ οὐ γὰρ ὁρῶ τοὺς κυρίους, ὥσπερ τῶν ἐνθάδε γιγνομένων τοὺς δημιουργούς.
English: "Yes; for I don’t see the master hand, whereas I see the makers of things in this world."


Greek: 313 οὐδὲ γὰρ τὴν σαυτοῦ σύγε ψυχὴν ὁρᾷς, ἣ τοῦ σώματος κυρία ἐστίν;
English: "Neither do you see your own soul, which has the mastery of the body; 

Greek: 314 ὥστε κατά γε τοῦτο ἔξεστί σοι λέγειν, ὅτι οὐδὲν γνώμῃ, ἀλλὰ τύχῃ πάντα πράττεις.
English: so that, as far as that goes, you may say that you do nothing by design, but everything by chance." 

Greek: 315 καὶ ὁ Ἀριστόδημος, οὔτοι, ἔφη, ἐγώ, ὦ Σώκρατες, ὑπερορῶ τὸ δαιμόνιον, ἀλλ’ ἐκεῖνο μεγαλοπρεπέστερον ἡγοῦμαι ἢ ὡς τῆς ἐμῆς θεραπείας προσδεῖσθαι.
English: Here Aristodemus exclaimed: "Really, Socrates, I don’t despise the godhead. But I think it is too great to need my service." 

Greek: 316 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, ὅσῳ μεγαλοπρεπέστερον ὂν ἀξιοῖ σε θεραπεύειν, τοσούτῳ μᾶλλον τιμητέον αὐτό.
English: "So, the greater the power that deigns to serve you, the more honor it demands of you," Socrates replied.

Continuing from Greek sentence 317:

Greek: 317 εὖ ἴσθι , ἔφη , ὅτι , εἰ νομίζοιμι θεοὺς ἀνθρώπων τι φροντίζειν , οὐκ ἂν ἀμελοίην αὐτῶν .
English: "Rest assured," he said, "if I thought that the gods took any care of men, I would not neglect them."

Greek: 318 ἔπειτ’ οὐκ οἴει φροντίζειν ;
English: "Then do you think they do not care?"

Greek: 319 οἳ πρῶτον μὲν μόνον τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον ὀρθὸν ἀνέστησαν ·
English: "They, who of all creatures made only man stand upright."

Greek: 320 ἡ δὲ ὀρθότης καὶ προορᾶν πλέον ποιεῖ δύνασθαι καὶ τὰ ὕπερθεν μᾶλλον θεᾶσθαι καὶ ἧττον κακοπαθεῖν καὶ ὄψιν καὶ ἀκοὴν καὶ στόμα ἐνεποίησαν ·
English: "This erect posture enables him to see farther, to observe things above, and lessens his suffering; and for him they created vision, hearing, and speech."

Greek: 321 ἔπειτα τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἑρπετοῖς πόδας ἔδωκαν , οἳ τὸ πορεύεσθαι μόνον παρέχουσιν , ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ καὶ χεῖρας προσέθεσαν , αἳ τὰ πλεῖστα οἷς εὐδαιμονέστεροι ἐκείνων ἐσμὲν ἐξεργάζονται .
English: "Then, to other creeping creatures they gave feet, which only enable movement, but to man they added hands, which are instruments for our greater happiness."

Greek: 322 καὶ μὴν γλῶττάν γε πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἐχόντων , μόνην τὴν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐποίησαν οἵαν ἄλλοτε ἀλλαχῇ ψαύουσαν τοῦ στόματος ἀρθροῦν τε τὴν φωνὴν καὶ σημαίνειν πάντα ἀλλήλοις ἃ βουλόμεθα .
English: "And though all animals have a tongue, only man's tongue has the ability to articulate speech and express all our desires to each other."

Greek: 323 τὸ δὲ καὶ τὰς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἡδονὰς τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ζῴοις δοῦναι περιγράψαντας τοῦ ἔτους χρόνον , ἡμῖν δὲ συνεχῶς μέχρι γήρως ταῦτα παρέχειν .
English: "Furthermore, while limiting sexual pleasures to a certain season for other animals, for humans they provided it continuously up to old age."

Greek: 324 οὐ τοίνυν μόνον ἤρκεσε τῷ θεῷ τοῦ σώματος ἐπιμεληθῆναι , ἀλλ’ , ὅπερ μέγιστόν ἐστι , καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν κρατίστην τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐνέφυσε .
English: "So it was not enough for the deity to care for the body; he also imparted to man the noblest soul, which is of utmost importance."

Greek: 325 τίνος γὰρ ἄλλου ζῴου ψυχὴ πρῶτα μὲν θεῶν τῶν τὰ μέγιστα καὶ κάλλιστα συνταξάντων ᾔσθηται ὅτι εἰσί ;
English: "For what other animal's soul is aware, first and foremost, of the gods who have ordained the greatest and fairest things?"

Greek: 326 τί δὲ φῦλον ἄλλο ἢ ἄνθρωποι θεοὺς θεραπεύουσι ;
English: "And what race other than humans worships the gods?"

Greek: 327 ποία δὲ ψυχὴ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἱκανωτέρα προφυλάττεσθαι ἢ λιμὸν ἢ δίψος ἢ ψύχη ἢ θάλπη , ἢ νόσοις ἐπικουρῆσαι , ἢ ῥώμην ἀσκῆσαι , ἢ πρὸς μάθησιν ἐκπονῆσαι , ἢ ὅσα ἂν ἀκούσῃ ἢ ἴδῃ ἢ μάθῃ ἱκανωτέρα ἐστὶ διαμεμνῆσθαι ;
English: "And which soul, other than the human soul, is more capable of guarding against hunger, thirst, cold, heat, to heal sickness, to develop strength, to toil for learning, and to remember accurately all that it hears, sees, or learns?"

Continuing from Greek sentence 317:

Greek: 317 εὖ ἴσθι, ἔφη, ὅτι, εἰ νομίζοιμι θεοὺς ἀνθρώπων τι φροντίζειν, οὐκ ἂν ἀμελοίην αὐτῶν.
English: "Rest assured," he said, "if I thought that the gods took any care of men, I would not neglect them."

Greek: 318 ἔπειτ’ οὐκ οἴει φροντίζειν;
English: "Then do you think they do not care?"

Greek: 319 οἳ πρῶτον μὲν μόνον τῶν ζῴων ἄνθρωπον ὀρθὸν ἀνέστησαν;
English: "They, who of all creatures made only man stand upright."

Greek: 320 ἡ δὲ ὀρθότης καὶ προορᾶν πλέον ποιεῖ δύνασθαι καὶ τὰ ὕπερθεν μᾶλλον θεᾶσθαι καὶ ἧττον κακοπαθεῖν καὶ ὄψιν καὶ ἀκοὴν καὶ στόμα ἐνεποίησαν;
English: "This upright posture enables him to see farther, to observe things above, and lessens his suffering; and for him they created vision, hearing, and speech."

Greek: 321 ἔπειτα τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις ἑρπετοῖς πόδας ἔδωκαν, οἳ τὸ πορεύεσθαι μόνον παρέχουσιν, ἀνθρώπῳ δὲ καὶ χεῖρας προσέθεσαν, αἳ τὰ πλεῖστα οἷς εὐδαιμονέστεροι ἐκείνων ἐσμὲν ἐξεργάζονται.
English: "Then, to other creeping creatures they gave feet, which only enable movement, but to man they added hands, which are instruments for our greater happiness."

Greek: 322 καὶ μὴν γλῶττάν γε πάντων τῶν ζῴων ἐχόντων, μόνην τὴν τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἐποίησαν οἵαν ἄλλοτε ἀλλαχῇ ψαύουσαν τοῦ στόματος ἀρθροῦν τε τὴν φωνὴν καὶ σημαίνειν πάντα ἀλλήλοις ἃ βουλόμεθα.
English: "And though all animals have a tongue, the tongue of man alone has been formed by them to be capable of contact with different parts of the mouth, so as to enable us to articulate the voice and express all our wants to one another."

Greek: 323 τὸ δὲ καὶ τὰς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἡδονὰς τοῖς μὲν

 ἄλλοις ζῴοις δοῦναι περιγράψαντας τοῦ ἔτους χρόνον, ἡμῖν δὲ συνεχῶς μέχρι γήρως ταῦτα παρέχειν.
English: "Furthermore, while limiting sexual pleasures to a certain season for other animals, for humans they provided it continuously up to old age."

Greek: 324 οὐ τοίνυν μόνον ἤρκεσε τῷ θεῷ τοῦ σώματος ἐπιμεληθῆναι, ἀλλ’, ὅπερ μέγιστόν ἐστι, καὶ τὴν ψυχὴν κρατίστην τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ ἐνέφυσε.
English: "So it was not enough for the deity to care for the body; he also imparted to man the noblest soul, which is of utmost importance."

Greek: 325 τίνος γὰρ ἄλλου ζῴου ψυχὴ πρῶτα μὲν θεῶν τῶν τὰ μέγιστα καὶ κάλλιστα συνταξάντων ᾔσθηται ὅτι εἰσί;
English: "For what other animal's soul is aware, first and foremost, of the gods who have ordained the greatest and fairest things?"

Greek: 326 τί δὲ φῦλον ἄλλο ἢ ἄνθρωποι θεοὺς θεραπεύουσι;
English: "And what race other than humans worships the gods?"

Greek: 327 ποία δὲ ψυχὴ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης ἱκανωτέρα προφυλάττεσθαι ἢ λιμὸν ἢ δίψος ἢ ψύχη ἢ θάλπη, ἢ νόσοις ἐπικουρῆσαι, ἢ ῥώμην ἀσκῆσαι, ἢ πρὸς μάθησιν ἐκπονῆσαι, ἢ ὅσα ἂν ἀκούσῃ ἢ ἴδῃ ἢ μάθῃ ἱκανωτέρα ἐστὶ διαμεμνῆσθαι;
English: "And which soul, other than the human soul, is more capable of guarding against hunger, thirst, cold, heat, to heal sickness, to develop strength, to toil for learning, and to remember accurately all that it hears, sees, or learns?"

Greek: 328 οὐ γὰρ πάνυ σοι κατάδηλον ὅτι παρὰ τ- ἄλλα ζῷα ὥσπερ θεοὶ ἄνθρωποι βιοτεύουσι, φύσει καὶ τῷ σώματι καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ κρατιστεύοντες;
English: "Is it not quite clear to you that compared to other animals, humans live as if they were gods, surpassing in nature, body, and soul?"

Greek: 329 οὔτε γὰρ βοὸς ἂν ἔχων σῶμα, ἀνθρώπου δὲ γνώμην ἐδύνατ’ ἂν πράττειν ἃ ἐβούλετο, οὔθ’ ὅσα χεῖρας ἔχει, ἄφρονα δ’ ἐστί, πλέον οὐδὲν ἔχει.
English: "For neither could a creature with an ox's body and a man's intellect carry out his desires, nor one with hands but without reason achieve more."

Greek: 330 σὺ δ’ ἀμφοτέρων τῶν πλείστου ἀξίων τετυχηκὼς οὐκ οἴει σοῦ θεοὺς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι;
English: "Do you, having received the two most valuable gifts, not think that the gods take care of you?"

Greek: 331 ἀλλ’ ὅταν τί ποιήσωσι, νομιεῖς αὐτοὺς σοῦ φροντίζειν;
English: "But when they do something, do you think they care for you?"

Greek: 332 ὅταν πέμπωσιν, ὥσπερ σὺ φὴς πέμπειν αὐτούς, συμβούλους ὅ τι χρὴ ποιεῖν καὶ μὴ ποιεῖν.
English: "When they send, as you claim they do, counsellors to advise what to do and what not to do."

Greek: 333 ὅταν δὲ Ἀθηναίοις, ἔφη, πυνθανομένοις τι διὰ μαντικῆς φράζωσιν, οὐ καὶ σοὶ δοκεῖς φράζειν αὐτούς, οὐδ’ ὅταν τοῖς Ἕλλησι τέρατα πέμποντες προσημαίνωσιν, οὐδ’ ὅταν πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ μόνον σὲ ἐξαιροῦντες ἐν ἀμελείᾳ κατατίθενται;
English: "And when the Athenians, through divination, seek guidance and they provide answers, do you not think they also guide you? Or when they send omens to the Greeks or to all mankind? Do you think they neglect everyone but you?"

Continuing from Greek sentence 334:

Greek: 334 οἴει δ’ ἂν τοὺς θεοὺς τοῖς ἀνθρώποις δόξαν ἐμφῦσαι ὡς ἱκανοί εἰσιν εὖ καὶ κακῶς ποιεῖν, εἰ μὴ δυνατοὶ ἦσαν, καὶ ἀνθρώπους ἐξαπατωμένους τὸν πάντα χρόνον οὐδέποτ’ ἂν αἰσθέσθαι;
English: "Do you really think the gods would instill in humans the belief that they have the power to do good or harm if they weren't capable of it, and that humans would be deceived all this time without ever realizing it?"

Greek: 335 οὐχ ὁρᾷς ὅτι τὰ πολυχρονιώτατα καὶ σοφώτατα τῶν ἀνθρωπίνων, πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη, θεοσεβέστατά ἐστι, καὶ αἱ φρονιμώταται ἡλικίαι θεῶν ἐπιμελέσταται;
English: "Don't you see that the most enduring and wisest of human institutions, such as cities and nations, are the most devout in worshipping gods, and the most sensible people are the most attentive to the gods?"

Greek: 336 ὠγαθέ, ἔφη, κατάμαθε ὅτι καὶ ὁ σὸς νοῦς ἐνὼν τὸ σὸν σῶμα ὅπως βούλεται μεταχειρίζεται.
English: "O good man, understand that just as your mind, residing within your body, uses it as it wishes, so it is with these things."

Greek: 337 οἴεσθαι οὖν χρὴ καὶ τὴν ἐν τῷ παντὶ φρόνησιν τὰ πάντα, ὅπως ἂν αὐτῇ ἡδὺ ᾖ, οὕτω τίθεσθαι, καὶ μὴ τὸ σὸν μὲν ὄμμα δύνασθαι ἐπὶ πολλὰ στάδια ἐξικνεῖσθαι, τὸν δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ ὀφθαλμὸν ἀδύνατον εἶναι ἅμα πάντα ὁρᾶν, μηδὲ τὴν σὴν μὲν ψυχὴν καὶ περὶ τῶν ἐνθάδε καὶ περὶ τῶν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ ἐν Σικελίᾳ δύνασθαι φροντίζειν, τὴν δὲ τοῦ θεοῦ φρόνησιν μὴ ἱκανὴν εἶναι ἅμα πάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι.
English: "So, do you believe that the wisdom within the universe arranges all things as it pleases, and that while your own eye can reach over many miles, God's eye cannot see everything at once? And that your own soul can concern itself with things here and in Egypt and Sicily, but the wisdom of God is not capable of caring for everything simultaneously?"


Greek: 338 ἂν μέντοι, ὥσπερ ἀνθρώπους θεραπεύων γιγνώσκεις τοὺς ἀντιθεραπεύειν ἐθέλοντας καὶ χαριζόμενος τοὺς ἀντιχαριζομένους καὶ συμβουλευόμενος καταμανθάνεις τοὺς φρονίμους, οὕτω καὶ τῶν θεῶν πεῖραν λαμβάνῃς θεραπεύων, εἴ τί σοι θελήσουσι περὶ τῶν ἀδήλων ἀνθρώποις συμβουλεύειν, γνώσει τὸ θεῖον ὅτι τοσοῦτον καὶ τοιοῦτόν ἐστιν ὥσθ’ ἅμα πάντα ὁρᾶν καὶ πάντα ἀκούειν καὶ πανταχοῦ παρεῖναι καὶ ἅμα πάντων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι αὐτούς.
English: Similarly, just as you recognize those who reciprocate your service, show kindness to those who are kind to you, and discern the wise by seeking their counsel, try serving the gods and observe whether they offer you guidance in matters hidden from humans. Then you will understand the divine nature, so great and such that it can see and hear all things, be everywhere at once, and be mindful of everything.

Greek: 339 ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ταῦτα λέγων οὐ μόνον τοὺς συνόντας ἐδόκει ποιεῖν ὁπότε ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὁρῷντο, ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν ἀνοσίων τε καὶ ἀδίκων καὶ αἰσχρῶν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ὁπότε ἐν ἐρημίᾳ εἶεν, ἐπείπερ ἡγήσαιντο μηδὲν ἄν ποτε ὧν πράττοιεν θεοὺς διαλαθεῖν.
English: In saying these things, he not only encouraged those present to abstain from impious, unjust, and shameful actions when observed by others, but even when alone, as they were convinced that nothing they did could ever escape the notice of the gods.

Greek: 340 εἰ δὲ δὴ καὶ ἐγκράτεια καλόν τε κ- ἀγαθὸν ἀνδρὶ κτῆμά ἐστιν, ἐπισκεψώμεθα εἴ τι προυβίβαζε λέγων εἰς ταύτην τοιάδε; ὦ ἄνδρες, εἰ πολέμου ἡμῖν γενομένου βουλοίμεθα ἑλέσθαι ἄνδρα, ὑφ’ οὗ μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ μὲν σῳζοίμεθα, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους χειροίμεθα, ἆρ’ ὅντινα ἂν αἰσθανοίμεθα ἥττω γαστρὸς ἢ οἴνου ἢ ἀφροδισίων ἢ πόνου ἢ ὕπνου, τοῦτον ἂν αἱροίμεθα; καὶ πῶς ἂν οἰηθείημεν τὸν τοιοῦτον ἢ ἡμᾶς σῶσαι ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους κρατῆσαι;
English: If self-control is indeed a valuable and noble possession for a man, let us consider if he led them toward this virtue with words like these: 'Men, if in a war we needed to choose a leader under whom we could be saved and conquer our enemies, would we select someone who is less dominated by hunger, wine, lust, toil, or sleep? How could we then expect such a person to save us or defeat our enemies?'

Greek: 341 ὦ ἄνδρες, εἰ πολέμου ἡμῖν γενομένου βουλοίμεθα ἑλέσθαι ἄνδρα, ὑφ’ οὗ μάλιστ’ ἂν αὐτοὶ μὲν σῳζοίμεθα, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους χειροίμεθα, ἆρ’ ὅντινα ἂν αἰσθανοίμεθα ἥττω γαστρὸς ἢ οἴνου ἢ ἀφροδισίων ἢ πόνου ἢ ὕπνου, τοῦτον ἂν αἱροίμεθα;

English: 
My friends, if we were at war and wanted to choose a leader most capable of helping us to save ourselves and conquer the enemy, should we choose one whom we knew to be the slave of the belly, or of wine, or lust, or sleep? How could we expect that such an one would either save us or defeat the enemy?

Greek: 342 καὶ πῶς ἂν οἰηθείημεν τὸν τοιοῦτον ἢ ἡμᾶς σῶσαι ἢ τοὺς πολεμίους κρατῆσαι;

English: 
How could we expect that such an one would either save us or defeat the enemy?

Greek: 343 εἰ δ’ ἐπὶ τελευτῇ τοῦ βίου γενόμενοι βουλοίμεθά τῳ ἐπιτρέψαι ἢ παῖδας ἄρρενας παιδεῦσαι ἢ θυγατέρας παρθένους διαφυλάξαι ἢ χρήματα διασῶσαι, ἆρ’ ἀξιόπιστον εἰς ταῦθ’ ἡγησόμεθα τὸν ἀκρατῆ;

English: 
Or if at the end of our life we should wish to appoint a guardian to educate our boys or protect our girls or to take care of our goods, should we think a loose liver a trustworthy man to choose?

Greek: 344 δούλῳ δ’ ἀκρατεῖ ἐπιτρέψαιμεν ἂν ἢ βοσκήματα ἢ ταμιεῖα ἢ ἔργων ἐπιστασίαν;

English: 
Should we entrust live stock or storehouses or the management of works to a vicious slave?

Greek: 345 διάκονον δὲ καὶ ἀγοραστὴν τοιοῦτον ἐθελήσαιμεν ἂν προῖκα λαβεῖν;

English: 
Should we be willing to take as a gift a page or an errandboy with such a character?

Greek: 346 ἀλλὰ μὴν εἴ γε μηδὲ δοῦλον ἀκρατῆ δεξαίμεθ’ ἄν, πῶς οὐκ ἄξιον αὐτόν γε φυλάξασθαι τοιοῦτον γενέσθαι;

English: 
Surely then, if we should refuse a vicious slave, the master must look to it that he does not grow vicious himself?

Greek: 347 καὶ γὰρ οὐχ ὥσπερ οἱ πλεονέκται τῶν ἄλλων ἀφαιρούμενοι χρήματα ἑαυτοὺς δοκοῦσι πλουτίζειν, οὕτως ὁ ἀκρατὴς τοῖς μὲν ἄλλοις βλαβερός, ἑαυτῷ δ’ ὠφέλιμος, ἀλλὰ κακοῦργος μὲν τῶν ἄλλων, ἑαυτοῦ δὲ πολὺ κακουργότερος, εἴ γε κακουργότατόν ἐστι μὴ μόνον τὸν οἶκον τὸν ἑαυτοῦ φθείρειν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὴν ψυχήν;

English: 
For whereas the covetous, by robbing other men of their goods, seem to enrich themselves, a vicious man reaps no advantage from the harm he does to others. If he is a worker of mischief to others, he brings much greater mischief on himself, if indeed the greatest mischief of all is to ruin not one’s home merely, but the body and the soul.

Greek: 348 ἐν συνουσίᾳ δὲ τίς ἂν ἡσθείη τῷ τοιούτῳ, ὃν εἰδείη τῷ ὄψῳ τε καὶ τῷ οἴνῳ χαίροντα μᾶλλον ἢ τοῖς φίλοις καὶ τὰς πόρνας ἀγαπῶντα μᾶλλον ἢ τοὺς ἑταίρους;

English: 
In social intercourse what pleasure could you find in such a man, knowing that he prefers your sauces and your wines to your friends, and likes the women better than the company?

Greek: 349 ἆρά γε οὐ χρὴ πάντα ἄνδρα, ἡγησάμενον τὴν ἐγκράτειαν ἀρετῆς εἶναι κρηπῖδα, ταύτην πρῶτον ἐν τῇ ψυχῇ κατασκευάσασθαι;

English: 
Should not every man hold self-control to be the foundation of all virtue, and first lay this foundation firmly in his soul?

Greek: 350 τίς γὰρ ἄνευ ταύτης ἢ μάθοι τι ἂν ἀγαθὸν ἢ μελετήσειεν ἀξιολόγως;

English: 
For who without this can learn any good or practise it worthily?

Greek: 351 ἢ τίς οὐκ ἂν ταῖς ἡδοναῖς δουλεύων αἰσχρῶς διατεθείη καὶ τὸ σῶμα καὶ τὴν ψυχήν;

English: 
Or what man that is the slave of his pleasures is not in an evil plight body and soul alike?

Greek: 352 ἐμοὶ μὲν δοκεῖ νὴ τὴν Ἥραν ἐλευθέρῳ μὲν ἀνδρὶ εὐκτὸν εἶναι μὴ τυχεῖν δούλου τοιούτου, δουλεύοντα δὲ ταῖς τοιαύταις ἡδοναῖς ἱκετευτέον τοὺς θεοὺς δεσποτῶν ἀγαθῶν τυχεῖν;

English: 
From my heart I declare that every free man should pray not to have such a man among his slaves; and every man who is a slave to such pleasures should entreat the gods to give him good masters: thus, and only thus, may he find salvation.

Greek: 353 οὕτω γὰρ ἂν μόνως ὁ τοιοῦτος σωθείη.

English: 
Thus, and only thus, may he find salvation.

Greek: 354 τοιαῦτα δὲ λέγων ἔτι ἐγκρατέστερον τοῖς ἔργοις ἢ τοῖς λόγοις ἑαυτὸν ἐπεδείκνυεν ·
English: Such were his words; but his own self-control was shown yet more clearly by his deeds than by his words.

Greek: 355 οὐ γὰρ μόνον τῶν διὰ τοῦ σώματος ἡδονῶν ἐκράτει, ἀλλὰ καὶ τῆς διὰ τῶν χρημάτων, νομίζων τὸν παρὰ τοῦ τυχόντος χρήματα λαμβάνοντα δεσπότην ἑαυτοῦ καθιστάναι καὶ δουλεύειν δουλείαν οὐδεμιᾶς ἧττον αἰσχράν.
English: For he kept in subjection not only the pleasures of the body, but those too that money brings, in the belief that he who takes money from any casual giver puts himself under a master and endures the basest form of slavery.

Greek: 356 ἄξιον δ’ αὐτοῦ καὶ ἃ πρὸς Ἀντιφῶντα τὸν σοφιστὴν διελέχθη μὴ παραλιπεῖν.
English: It is due to him that a conversation he had with Antiphon the Sophist should not go unrecorded.

Greek: 357 ὁ γὰρ Ἀντιφῶν ποτε βουλόμενος τοὺς συνουσιαστὰς αὐτοῦ παρελέσθαι προσελθὼν τῷ Σωκράτει παρόντων αὐτῶν ἔλεξε τάδε ·
English: Antiphon came to Socrates with the intention of drawing his companions away from him, and spoke thus in their presence:

Greek: 358 ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐγὼ μὲν ᾤμην τοὺς φιλοσοφοῦντας εὐδαιμονεστέρους χρῆναι γίγνεσθαι ·
English: “Socrates, I supposed that philosophy must add to one’s store of happiness.

Greek: 359 σὺ δέ μοι δοκεῖς τ- ἐναντία τῆς φιλοσοφίας ἀπολελαυκέναι.
English: But the fruits you have reaped from philosophy are apparently very different.

Greek: 360 ζῇς γοῦν οὕτως ὡς οὐδ’ ἂν εἷς δοῦλος ὑπὸ δεσπότῃ διαιτώμενος μείνειε ·
English: For example, you are living a life that would drive even a slave to desert his master.

Greek: 361 σῖτά τε σιτῇ καὶ ποτὰ πίνεις τὰ φαυλότατα, καὶ ἱμάτιον ἠμφίεσαι οὐ μόνον φαῦλον, ἀλλὰ τὸ αὐτὸ θέρους τε καὶ χειμῶνος, ἀνυπόδητός τε καὶ ἀχίτων διατελεῖς.
English: Your meat and drink are of the poorest: the cloak you wear is not only a poor thing, but is never changed summer or winter; and you never wear shoes or tunic.

Greek: 362 καὶ μὴν χρήματά γε οὐ λαμβάνεις, ἃ καὶ κτωμένους εὐφραίνει καὶ κεκτημένους ἐλευθεριώτερόν τε καὶ ἥδιον ποιεῖ ζῆν.
English: Besides you refuse to take money, the mere getting of which is a joy, while its possession makes one more independent and happier.

Greek: 363 εἰ οὖν ὥσπερ καὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἔργων οἱ διδάσκαλοι τοὺς μαθητὰς μιμητὰς ἑαυτῶν ἀποδεικνύουσιν, οὕτω καὶ σὺ τοὺς συνόντας διαθήσεις, νόμιζε κακοδαιμονίας διδάσκαλος εἶναι.
English: Now the professors of other subjects try to make their pupils copy their teachers: if you too intend to make your companions do that, you must consider yourself a professor of unhappiness.”

Greek: 364 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπε ·

English: To this Socrates replied:

Greek: 365 δοκεῖς μοι, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, ὑπειληφέναι με οὕτως ἀνιαρῶς ζῆν, ὥστε πέπεισμαι σὲ μᾶλλον ἀποθανεῖν ἂν ἑλέσθαι ἢ ζῆν ὥσπερ ἐγώ.

English: "Antiphon, you seem to have a notion that my life is so miserable, that I feel sure you would choose death in preference to a life like mine."

Greek: 366 ἴθι οὖν ἐπισκεψώμεθα τί χαλεπὸν ᾔσθησαι τοῦ ἐμοῦ βίου.

English: "Come then, let us consider together what hardship you have noticed in my life."

Greek: 367 πότερον ὅτι τοῖς μὲν λαμβάνουσιν ἀργύριον ἀναγκαῖόν ἐστιν ἀπεργάζεσθαι τοῦτο ἐφ’ ᾧ ἂν μισθὸν λάβωσιν, ἐμοὶ δὲ μὴ λαμβάνοντι οὐκ ἀνάγκη διαλέγεσθαι ᾧ ἂν μὴ βούλωμαι;

English: "Is it that those who take money are bound to carry out the work for which they get a fee, while I, because I refuse to take it, am not obliged to talk with anyone against my will?"

Greek: 368 ἢ τὴν δίαιτάν μου φαυλίζεις ὡς ἧττον μὲν ὑγιεινὰ ἐσθίοντος ἐμοῦ ἢ σοῦ, ἧττον δὲ ἰσχὺν παρέχοντα;

English: "Or do you think my food poor because it is less wholesome than yours or less nourishing?"

Greek: 369 ἢ ὡς χαλεπώτερα πορίσασθαι τὰ ἐμὰ διαιτήματα τῶν σῶν διὰ τὸ σπανιώτερά τε καὶ πολυτελέστερα εἶναι;

English: "Or because my viands are harder to get than yours, being scarcer and more expensive?"

Greek: 370 ἢ ὡς ἡδίω σοι ἃ σὺ παρασκευάζῃ ὄντα ἢ ἐμοὶ ἃ ἐγώ;

English: "Or because your diet is more enjoyable than mine?"

Greek: 371 οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι ὁ μὲν ἥδιστα ἐσθίων ἥκιστα ὄψου δεῖται, ὁ δὲ ἥδιστα πίνων ἥκιστα τοῦ μὴ παρόντος ἐπιθυμεῖ ποτοῦ;

English: "Do you not know that the greater the enjoyment of eating the less the need of sauce; the greater the enjoyment of drinking, the less the desire for drinks that are not available?"

Greek: 372 τά γε μὴν ἱμάτια οἶσθ’ ὅτι οἱ μεταβαλλόμενοι ψύχους καὶ θάλπους ἕνεκα μεταβάλλονται, καὶ ὑποδήματα ὑποδοῦνται, ὅπως μὴ διὰ τὰ λυποῦντα τοὺς πόδας κωλύωνται πορεύεσθαι;

English: "As for cloaks, they are changed, as you know, on account of cold or heat. And shoes are worn as a protection to the feet against pain and inconvenience in walking."

Greek: 373 ἤδη οὖν ποτε ᾔσθου ἐμὲ ἢ διὰ ψῦχος μᾶλλόν του ἔνδον μένοντα, ἢ διὰ θάλπος μαχόμενόν τῳ περὶ σκιᾶς, ἢ διὰ τὸ ἀλγεῖν τοὺς πόδας οὐ βαδίζοντα ὅπου ἂν βούλωμαι;

English: "Now did you ever know me to stay indoors more than others on account of the cold, or to fight with any man for the shade because of the heat, or to be prevented from walking anywhere by sore feet?"

Greek: 374 οὐκ οἶσθ’ ὅτι οἱ φύσει ἀσθενέστατοι τῷ σώματι μελετήσαντες τῶν ἰσχυροτάτων ἀμελησάντων κρείττους τε γίγνονται πρὸς ἃ ἂν μελετῶσι καὶ ῥᾷον αὐτὰ φέρουσιν;

English: "Do you not know that by training, a puny weakling comes to be better at any form of exercise he practises, and gets more staying power, than the muscular prodigy who neglects to train?"

Greek: 375 ἐμὲ δὲ ἄρα οὐκ οἴει, τῷ σώματι ἀεὶ τὰ συντυγχάνοντα μελετῶντα καρτερεῖν, πάντα ῥᾷον φέρειν σοῦ μὴ μελετῶντος;

English: "Seeing then that I am always training my body to answer any and every call on its powers, do you not think that I can stand every strain better than you can without training?"

Greek: 376 τοῦ δὲ μὴ δουλεύειν γαστρὶ μηδ’ ὕπνῳ καὶ λαγνείᾳ οἴει τι ἄλλο αἰτιώτερον εἶναι ἢ τὸ ἕτερα ἔχειν τούτων ἡδίω, ἃ οὐ μόνον ἐν χρείᾳ ὄντα εὐφραίνει, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐλπίδας παρέχοντα ὠφελήσειν ἀεί;

English: "For avoiding slavery to the belly or to sleep and incontinence, is there, think you, any more effective specific than the possession of other and greater pleasures, which are delightful not only to enjoy, but also because they arouse hopes of lasting benefit?"

Greek: 377 καὶ μὴν τοῦτό γε οἶσθα, ὅτι οἱ μὲν οἰόμενοι μηδὲν εὖ πράττειν οὐκ εὐφραίνονται, οἱ δὲ ἡγούμενοι καλῶς προχωρεῖν ἑαυτοῖς ἢ γεωργίαν ἢ ναυκληρίαν ἢ ἄλλ’ ὅ τι ἂν τυγχάνωσιν ἐργαζόμενοι ὡς εὖ πράττοντες εὐφραίνονται.

English: "And again, you surely know that while he who supposes that nothing goes well with him is unhappy, he who believes that he is successful in farming or a shipping concern or any other business he is engaged in is happy in the thought of his prosperity."

Greek: 378 οἴει οὖν ἀπὸ πάντων τούτων τοσαύτην ἡδονὴν εἶναι ὅσην ἀπὸ τοῦ ἑαυτόν τε ἡγεῖσθαι βελτίω γίγνεσθαι καὶ φίλους ἀμείνους κτᾶσθαι;

English: "Do you think then that out of all this thinking there comes anything so pleasant as the thought: 'I am growing in goodness and I am making better friends?'"

Greek: 379 ἐγὼ τοίνυν διατελῶ ταῦτα νομίζων.

English: "And that, I may say, is my constant thought."

Greek: 380 ἐὰν δὲ δὴ φίλους ἢ πόλιν ὠφελεῖν δέῃ, ποτέρῳ ἡ πλείων σχολὴ τούτων ἐπιμελεῖσθαι, τῷ ὡς ἐγὼ νῦν ἢ τῷ ὡς σὺ μακαρίζεις διαιτωμένῳ;

English: "Further, if help is wanted by friends or city, which of the two has more leisure to supply their needs, he who lives as I am living or he whose life you call happy?"

Greek: 381 στρατεύοιτο δὲ πότερος ἂν ῥᾷον, ὁ μὴ δυνάμενος ἄνευ πολυτελοῦς διαίτης ζῆν ἢ ᾧ τὸ παρὸν ἀρκοίη;

English: "Which will find soldiering the easier task, he who cannot exist without expensive food or he who is content with what he can get?"

Greek: 382 ἐκπολιορκηθείη δὲ πότερος ἂν θᾶττον, ὁ τῶν χαλεπωτάτων εὑρεῖν δεόμενος ἢ ὁ τοῖς ῥᾴστοις ἐντυγχάνειν ἀρκούντως χρώμενος;

English: "Which when besieged will surrender first, he who wants what is very hard to come by or he who can make shift with whatever is at hand?"

Greek: 383 ἔοικας, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν οἰομένῳ τρυφὴν καὶ πολυτέλειαν εἶναι· ἐγὼ δὲ νομίζω τὸ μὲν μηδενὸς δεῖσθαι θεῖον εἶναι, τὸ δ' ὡς ἐλαχίστων ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου, καὶ τὸ μὲν θεῖον κράτιστον, τὸ δ' ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ κρατίστου.


Greek: 384 Εγὼ δὲ νομίζω τὸ μὲν μηδενὸς δεῖσθαι θεῖον εἶναι, τὸ δ' ὡς ἐλαχίστων ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου, καὶ τὸ μὲν θεῖον κράτιστον, τὸ δ' ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ θείου ἐγγυτάτω τοῦ κρατίστου.

English: "You seem, Antiphon, to imagine that happiness consists in luxury and extravagance. But my belief is that to have no wants is divine; to have as few as possible comes next to the divine; and as that which is divine is supreme, so that which approaches nearest to its nature is nearest to the supreme."

Greek: 385 πάλιν δέ ποτε ὁ Ἀντιφῶν διαλεγόμενος τῷ Σωκράτει εἶπεν·

English: "In another conversation with Socrates, Antiphon said:"

Greek: 386 ὦ Σώκρατες, ἐγώ τοί σε δίκαιον μὲν νομίζω, σοφὸν δὲ οὐδ' ὁπωστιοῦν·

English: "Socrates, I for my part believe you to be a just, but by no means a wise man."

Greek: 387 δοκεῖς δέ μοι καὶ αὐτὸς τοῦτο γιγνώσκειν·

English: "And I think you realise it yourself."

Greek: 388 οὐδένα γοῦν τῆς συνουσίας ἀργύριον πράττῃ.

English: "Anyhow, you decline to take money for your society."

Greek: 389 καίτοι τό γε ἱμάτιον ἢ τὴν οἰκίαν ἢ ἄλλο τι ὧν κέκτησαι νομίζων ἀργυρίου ἄξιον εἶναι οὐδενὶ ἂν μὴ ὅτι προῖκα δοίης, ἀλλ’ οὐδ’ ἔλαττον τῆς ἀξίας λαβών.

English: "Yet if you believed your cloak or house or anything you possess to be worth money, you would not part with it for nothing or even for less than its value."

Greek: 390 δῆλον δὴ ὅτι εἰ καὶ τὴν συνουσίαν ᾤου τινὸς ἀξίαν εἶναι, καὶ ταύτης ἂν οὐκ ἔλαττον τῆς ἀξίας ἀργύριον ἐπράττου.

English: "Clearly, then, if you set any value on your society, you would insist on getting the proper price for that too."

Greek: 391 δίκαιος μὲν οὖν ἂν εἴης, ὅτι οὐκ ἐξαπατᾷς ἐπὶ πλεονεξίᾳ, σοφὸς δὲ οὐκ ἄν, μηδενός γε ἄξια ἐπιστάμενος.

English: "It may well be that you are a just man because you do not cheat people through avarice; but wise you cannot be, since your knowledge is not worth anything."

392 ὁ δὲ Σωκράτης πρὸς ταῦτα εἶπεν·
To this Socrates replied:

393 ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, παρ’ ἡμῖν νομίζεται τὴν ὥραν καὶ τὴν σοφίαν ὁμοίως μὲν καλόν, ὁμοίως δὲ αἰσχρὸν διατίθεσθαι εἶναι.
"Antiphon, it is common opinion among us in regard to beauty and wisdom that there is an honourable and a shameful way of bestowing them."

394 τήν τε γὰρ ὥραν ἐὰν μέν τις ἀργυρίου πωλῇ τῷ βουλομένῳ, πόρνον αὐτὸν ἀποκαλοῦσιν, ἐὰν δέ τις, ὃν ἂν γνῷ καλόν τε κ- ἀγαθὸν ἐραστὴν ὄντα, τοῦτον φίλον ἑαυτῷ ποιῆται, σώφρονα νομίζομεν·
"For to offer one’s beauty for money to all comers is called prostitution; but we think it virtuous to become friendly with a lover who is known to be a man of honour."

395 καὶ τὴν σοφίαν ὡσαύτως τοὺς μὲν ἀργυρίου τῷ βουλομένῳ πωλοῦντας σοφιστὰς ὥσπερ πόρνους ἀποκαλοῦσιν, ὅστις δὲ ὃν ἂν γνῷ εὐφυᾶ ὄντα διδάσκων ὅ τι ἂν ἔχῃ ἀγαθὸν φίλον ποιεῖται, τοῦτον νομίζομεν, ἃ τῷ καλῷ κ- ἀγαθῷ πολίτῃ προσήκει, ταῦτα ποιεῖν.
"So is it with wisdom. Those who offer it to all comers for money are known as sophists, prostitutors of wisdom, but we think that he who makes a friend of one whom he knows to be gifted by nature, and teaches him all the good he can, fulfils the duty of a citizen and a gentleman."

396 ἐγὼ δ’ οὖν καὶ αὐτός, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, ὥσπερ ἄλλος τις ἢ ἵππῳ ἀγαθῷ ἢ κυνὶ ἢ ὄρνιθι ἥδεται, οὕτω καὶ ἔτι μᾶλλον ἥδομαι φίλοις ἀγαθοῖς, καὶ ἐάν τι ἔχω ἀγαθόν, διδάσκω, καὶ ἄλλοις συνίστημι παρ’ ὧν ἂν ἡγῶμ

αι ὠφελήσεσθαί τι αὐτοὺς εἰς ἀρετήν·
"That is my own view, Antiphon. Others have a fancy for a good horse or dog or bird: my fancy, stronger even than theirs, is for good friends. And I teach them all the good I can, and recommend them to others from whom I think they will get some moral benefit."

397 καὶ τοὺς θησαυροὺς τῶν πάλαι σοφῶν ἀνδρῶν, οὓς ἐκεῖνοι κατέλιπον ἐν βιβλίοις γράψαντες, ἀνελίττων κοινῇ σὺν τοῖς φίλοις διέρχομαι, καὶ ἄν τι ὁρῶμεν ἀγαθὸν ἐκλεγόμεθα·
"And the treasures that the wise men of old have left us in their writings I open and explore with my friends. If we come on any good thing, we extract it, and we set much store on being useful to one another."

398 καὶ μέγα νομίζομεν κέρδος, ἐὰν ἀλλήλοις φίλοι γιγνώμεθα.
"For my part, when I heard these words fall from his lips, I judged him to be a happy man himself and to be putting his hearers in the way of being gentlemen."

399 ἐμοὶ μὲν δὴ ταῦτα ἀκούοντι ἐδόκει αὐτός τε μακάριος εἶναι καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντας ἐπὶ καλοκἀγαθίαν ἄγειν.
"And we set much store on being useful to one another."

400 καὶ πάλιν ποτὲ τοῦ Ἀντιφῶντος ἐρομένου αὐτόν, πῶς ἄλλους μὲν ἡγεῖται πολιτικοὺς ποιεῖν, αὐτὸς δ’ οὐ πράττει τὰ πολιτικά, εἴπερ ἐπίσταται·
On yet another occasion Antiphon asked him: "How can you suppose that you make politicians of others, when you yourself avoid politics even if you understand them?"

401 ποτέρως δ’ ἄν, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀντιφῶν, μᾶλλον τὰ πολιτικὰ πράττοιμι, εἰ μόνος αὐτὰ πράττοιμι ἢ εἰ ἐπιμελοίμην τοῦ ὡς πλείστους ἱκανοὺς εἶναι πράττειν αὐτά;
"How now, Antiphon?" he retorted, "should I play a more important part in politics by engaging in them alone or by taking pains to turn out as many competent politicians as possible?"

402 ἐπισκεψώμεθα δὲ εἰ καὶ ἀλαζονείας ἀποτρέπων τοὺς συνόντας ἀρετῆς ἐπιμελεῖσθαι προέτρεπεν·
Let us next consider whether by discouraging imposture he encouraged his companions to cultivate virtue.

403 ἀεὶ γὰρ ἔλεγεν ὡς οὐκ εἴη καλλίων ὁδὸς ἐπ’ εὐδοξίαν ἢ δι’ ἧς ἄν τις ἀγαθὸς τοῦτο γένοιτο, ὃ καὶ δοκεῖν βούλοιτο.
For he always said that the best road to glory is the way that makes a man as good as he wishes to be thought.

404 ὅτι δ’ ἀληθῆ ἔλεγεν, ὧδ’ ἐδίδασκεν·
And this was how he demonstrated the truth of this saying:

405 ἐνθυμώμεθα γάρ, ἔφη, εἴ τις μὴ ὢν ἀγαθὸς αὐλητὴς δοκεῖν βούλοιτο, τί ἂν αὐτῷ ποιητέον εἴη.
"Suppose a bad flute-player wants to be thought a good one, let us note what he must do."

406 ἆρ’ οὐ τὰ ἔξω τῆς τέχνης μιμητέον τοὺς ἀγαθοὺς αὐλητάς;
"Must he not imitate good players in the accessories of the art?"

407 καὶ πρῶτον μέν, ὅτι ἐκεῖνοι σκεύη τε καλὰ κέκτηνται καὶ ἀκολούθους πολλοὺς περιάγονται, καὶ τούτῳ ταῦτα ποιητέον·
"First, as they wear fine clothes and travel with many attendants, he must do the same."

408 ἔπειτα, ὅτι ἐκείνους πολλοὶ ἐπαινοῦσι, καὶ τούτῳ πολλοὺς ἐπαινέτας παρασκευαστέον.
"Further, seeing that they win the applause of crowds, he must provide himself with a large claque."

409 ἀλλὰ μὴν ἔργον γε οὐδαμοῦ ληπτέον, ἢ εὐθὺς ἐλεγχθήσεται γελοῖος ὢν καὶ οὐ μόνον αὐλητὴς κακός, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄνθρωπος ἀλαζών.
"But, of course, he must never accept an engagement, or he will promptly expose himself to ridicule as an incompetent player and an impostor to boot."

410 καίτοι πολλὰ μὲν δαπανῶν, μηδὲν δ’ ὠφελούμενος, πρὸς δὲ τούτοις κακοδοξῶν, πῶς οὐκ ἐπιπόνως τε καὶ ἀλυσιτελῶς καὶ καταγελάστως βιώσεται;
"And so, what with incurring heavy expense and gaining nothing, and bringing disgrace on himself as well, he will make his life burdensome, unprofitable and ridiculous."

411 ὣς δ’ αὔτως εἴ τις βούλοιτο στρατηγὸς ἀγαθὸς μὴ ὢν φαίνεσθαι ἢ κυβερνήτης, ἐννοῶμεν τί ἂν αὐτῷ συμβαίνοι.
"So too if a man who is not a general or a pilot wanted to be thought a good one, let us imagine what would happen to him."

412 ἆρ’ οὐκ ἄν, εἰ μὲν ἐπιθυμῶν τοῦ δοκεῖν ἱκανὸς εἶναι ταῦτα πράττειν μὴ δύναιτο πείθειν, τοῦτ’ εἴη λυπηρόν, εἰ δὲ πείσειεν, ἔτι ἀθλιώτερον;
"If his efforts to seem proficient in these duties failed to carry conviction, would not his failure be galling to him? if they succeeded, would not his success be still more disastrous?"

413 δῆλον γὰρ ὅτι κυβερνᾶν κατασταθεὶς ὁ μὴ ἐπιστάμενος ἢ στρατηγεῖν ἀπολέσειεν ἂν οὓς ἥκιστα βούλοιτο καὶ αὐτὸς αἰσχρῶς ἂν καὶ κακῶς ἀπαλλάξειεν.
"for it is certain that if a man who knew nothing about piloting a ship or commanding an army were appointed to such work, he would lose those whom he least wanted to lose and would bring ruin and disgrace on himself."

414 ὡσαύτως δὲ καὶ τὸ πλούσιον καὶ τὸ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ τὸ ἰσχυρὸν μὴ ὄντα δοκεῖν ἀλυσιτελὲς ἀπέφαινε;
"By similar reasoning he would show how unprofitable is a reputation for wealth or courage or strength when it is undeserved."

415 προστάττεσθαι γὰρ αὐτοῖς ἔφη μείζω ἢ κατὰ δύναμιν, καὶ μὴ δυναμένους ταῦτα ποιεῖν, δοκοῦντας ἱκανοὺς εἶναι, συγγνώμης οὐκ ἂν τυγχάνειν.
"Tasks beyond their powers," he would say, "are laid on the incompetent, and no mercy is shown to them when they disappoint the expectation formed of their capability."

416 ἀπατεῶνα δ’ ἐκάλει οὐ μικρὸν μὲν οὐδ’ εἴ τις ἀργύριον ἢ σκεῦος παρά του πειθοῖ λαβὼν ἀποστεροίη, πολὺ δὲ μέγιστον ὅστις μηδενὸς ἄξιος ὢν ἐξηπατήκοι πείθων ὡς ἱκανὸς εἴη τῆς πόλεως ἡγεῖσθαι.
"The man who persuades you to lend him money or goods and then keeps them is without doubt a rogue; but much the greatest rogue of all is the man who has gulled his city into the belief that he is fit to direct it."

417 ἐμοὶ μὲν οὖν ἐδόκει καὶ τοῦ ἀλαζονεύεσθαι ἀποτρέπειν τοὺς συνόντας τοιάδε διαλεγόμενος.
"For my part I thought that such talks did discourage imposture among his companions."

418 ἐδόκει δέ μοι καὶ τοιαῦτα λέγων προτρέπειν τοὺς συνόντας ἀσκεῖν ἐγκράτειαν πρὸς ἐπιθυμίαν βρωτοῦ καὶ ποτοῦ καὶ λαγνείας καὶ ὕπνου καὶ ῥίγους καὶ θάλπους καὶ πόνου.
"In other conversations I thought that he exhorted his companions to practise self-control in the matter of eating and drinking, and sexual indulgence, and sleeping, and endurance of cold and heat and toil."

419 γνοὺς γάρ τινα τῶν συνόντων ἀκολαστοτέρως ἔχοντα πρὸς τὰ τοιαῦτα, εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε, εἰ δέοι σε παιδεύειν παραλαβόντα δύο τῶν νέων, τὸν μέν, ὅπως ἱκανὸς ἔσται ἄρχειν, τὸν δ’, ὅπως μηδ’ ἀντιποιήσεται ἀρχῆς, πῶς ἂν ἑκάτερον παιδεύοις;
"Aware that one of his companions was rather intemperate in such matters, he said: 'Tell me, Aristippus, if you were required to take charge of two youths and educate them so that the one would be fit to rule and the other would never think of putting himself forward, how would you educate them? Shall we consider it, beginning with the elementary question of food?'"

420 βούλει σκοπῶμεν ἀρξάμενοι ἀπὸ τῆς τροφῆς ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν στοιχείων;
"Oh yes," replied Aristippus, "food does seem to come first; for one can’t live without food."

421 καὶ ὁ Ἀρίστιππος ἔφη·
Aristippus agreed, saying, "Yes, naturally."

422 δοκεῖ γοῦν μοι ἡ τροφὴ ἀρχὴ εἶναι·
He continued, "Food does seem to come first."

423 οὐδὲ γὰρ ζῴη γ’ ἄν τις, εἰ μὴ τρέφοιτο.
"For one can't live without food."

424 οὐκοῦν τὸ μὲν βούλεσθαι σίτου ἅπτεσθαι, ὅταν ὥρα ἥκῃ, ἀμφοτέροις εἰκὸς παραγίγνεσθαι;
"Well, now, will not a desire for food naturally arise in both at certain times?" 

425 εἰκὸς γάρ, ἔφη.
"Yes, naturally," Aristippus responded.

426 τὸ οὖν προαιρεῖσθαι τὸ κατεπεῖγον μᾶλλον πράττειν ἢ τῇ γαστρὶ

 χαρίζεσθαι πότερον ἂν αὐτῶν ἐθίζοιμεν;
"Now which of the two should we train in the habit of transacting urgent business before he satisfies his hunger?"

427 τὸν εἰς τὸ ἄρχειν, ἔφη, νὴ Δία παιδευόμενον, ὅπως μὴ τὰ τῆς πόλεως ἄπρακτα γίγνηται παρὰ τὴν ἐκείνου ἀρχήν.
"The one who is being trained to rule, undoubtedly; else State business might be neglected during his tenure."

428 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, καὶ ὅταν πιεῖν βούλωνται, τὸ δύνασθαι διψῶντα ἀνέχεσθαι τῷ αὐτῷ προσθετέον;
"And must not the same one be given power to resist thirst when both want to drink?"

429 πάνυ μὲν οὖν, ἔφη.
"Certainly," said Aristippus.

430 τὸ δὲ ὕπνου ἐγκρατῆ εἶναι, ὥστε δύνασθαι καὶ ὀψὲ κοιμηθῆναι καὶ πρῲ ἀναστῆναι καὶ ἀγρυπνῆσαι, εἴ τι δέοι, ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθείημεν;
"And to which shall we give the power of limiting his sleep so that he can go late to bed and get up early, and do without sleep if need be?"

431 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ αὐτῷ.
"To the same again," Aristippus agreed.

432 τί δέ, ἔφη, τὸ ἀφροδισίων ἐγκρατῆ εἶναι, ὥστε μὴ διὰ ταῦτα κωλύεσθαι πράττειν, εἴ τι δέοι;
"And the power to control his passions, so that he may not be hindered in doing necessary work?"

433 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ αὐτῷ.
"To the same again," he said.

434 τί δέ, τὸ μὴ φεύγειν τοὺς πόνους, ἀλλ’ ἐθελοντὴν ὑπομένειν ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθείημεν;
"And to which shall we give the habit of not shirking a task, but undertaking it willingly?"

435 καὶ τοῦτο, ἔφη, τῷ ἄρχειν παιδευομένῳ.
"That too will go to the one who is being trained to rule," said Aristippus.


436	τί δέ , τὸ μαθεῖν εἴ τι ἐπιτήδειόν ἐστι μάθημα πρὸς τὸ κρατεῖν τῶν ἀντιπάλων , ποτέρῳ ἂν προσθεῖναι μᾶλλον πρέποι ;
"And to which would the knowledge needful for overcoming enemies be more appropriately given?"

437	πολὺ νὴ Δί’ , ἔφη , τῷ ἄρχειν παιδευομένῳ ·
"Without doubt to the one who is being trained to rule;

438	καὶ γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων οὐδὲν ὄφελος ἄνευ τῶν τοιούτων μαθημάτων .
 for the other lessons would be useless without such knowledge."

439	οὐκοῦν ὁ οὕτω πεπαιδευμένος ἧττον ἂν δοκεῖ σοι ὑπὸ τῶν ἀντιπάλων ἢ τὰ λοιπὰ ζῷα ἁλίσκεσθαι ;
"Don’t you think that with this education he will be less likely to be caught by his enemy than other creatures?"

440	τούτων γὰρ δήπου τὰ μὲν γαστρὶ δελεαζόμενα , καὶ μάλα ἔνια δυσωπούμενα , ὅμως τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ τοῦ φαγεῖν ἀγόμενα πρὸς τὸ δέλεαρ ἁλίσκεται , τὰ δὲ ποτῷ ἐνεδρεύεται .
"Some of them, you know, are so greedy, that in spite of extreme timidity in some cases, they are drawn irresistibly to the bait to get food, and are caught; and others are snared by drink."

441	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Yes, certainly."

442	οὐκοῦν καὶ ἄλλα ὑπὸ λαγνείας , οἷον οἵ τε ὄρτυγες καὶ οἱ πέρδικες , πρὸς τὴν τῆς θηλείας φωνὴν τῇ ἐπιθυμίᾳ καὶ τῇ ἐλπίδι τῶν ἀφροδισίων φερόμενοι καὶ ἐξιστάμενοι τοῦ τὰ δεινὰ ἀναλογίζεσθαι τοῖς θηράτροις ἐμπίπτουσι ;
"Others again — quails and partridges, for instance — are so amorous, that when they hear the cry of the female, they are carried away by desire and anticipation, throw caution to the winds and blunder into the nets. Is it not so?"

443	συνέφη καὶ ταῦτα .
He agreed again.

444	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι

 αἰσχρὸν εἶναι ἀνθρώπῳ τ- αὐτὰ πάσχειν τοῖς ἀφρονεστάτοις τῶν θηρίων ;
"Now, don’t you think it disgraceful that a man should be in the same plight as the silliest of wild creatures?"

445	ὥσπερ οἱ μοιχοὶ εἰσέρχονται εἰς τὰς εἰρκτάς , εἰδότες ὅτι κίνδυνος τῷ μοιχεύοντι ἅ τε ὁ νόμος ἀπειλεῖ παθεῖν καὶ ἐνεδρευθῆναι καὶ ληφθέντα ὑβρισθῆναι ·
"Thus an adulterer enters the women’s quarters, knowing that by committing adultery he is in danger of incurring the penalties threatened by the law, and that he may be trapped, caught and ill-treated."

446	καὶ τηλικούτων μὲν ἐπικειμένων τῷ μοιχεύοντι κακῶν τε καὶ αἰσχρῶν , ὄντων δὲ πολλῶν τῶν ἀπολυσόντων τῆς τῶν ἀφροδισίων ἐπιθυμίας ἐν ἀδείᾳ , ὅμως εἰς τὰ ἐπικίνδυνα φέρεσθαι , ἆρ’ οὐκ ἤδη τοῦτο παντάπασι κακοδαιμονῶντός ἐστιν ;
"When such misery and disgrace hang over the adulterer’s head, and there are many remedies to relieve him of his carnal desire without risk, is it not sheer lunacy to plunge headlong into danger?"

447	ἔμοιγε δοκεῖ , ἔφη .
"Yes, I think it is."

448	τὸ δὲ εἶναι μὲν τὰς ἀναγκαιοτάτας πλείστας πράξεις τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἐν ὑπαίθρῳ , οἷον τάς τε πολεμικὰς καὶ τὰς γεωργικὰς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων οὐ τὰς ἐλαχίστας , τοὺς δὲ πολλοὺς ἀγυμνάστως ἔχειν πρός τε ψύχη καὶ θάλπη οὐ δοκεῖ σοι πολλὴ ἀμέλεια εἶναι ;
"And considering that the great majority of essential occupations, warfare, agriculture and very many others, are carried on in the open air, don’t you think it gross negligence that so many men are untrained to withstand cold and heat?"

449	συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο .
He agreed again.

450	οὐκοῦν δοκεῖ σοι τὸν μέλλοντα ἄρχειν ἀσκεῖν δεῖν καὶ ταῦτα εὐπετῶς φέρειν ;
"Don’t you think then, that one who is going to rule must adapt himself to bear them lightly?"

451	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Certainly."

452	οὐκοῦν εἰ τοὺς ἐγκρατεῖς τούτων ἁπάντων εἰς τοὺς ἀρχικοὺς τάττομεν , τοὺς ἀδυνάτους ταῦτα ποιεῖν εἰς τοὺς μηδ’ ἀντιποιησομένους τοῦ ἄρχειν τάξομεν ;
"If then we classify those who control themselves in all these matters as fit to rule, shall we not classify those who cannot behave so as men with no claim to be rulers?"

453	συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο .
He agreed again.

454	τί οὖν ;
"Well now, 

455	ἐπειδὴ καὶ τούτων ἑκατέρου τοῦ φύλου τὴν τάξιν οἶσθα , ἤδη ποτ’ ἐπεσκέψω , εἰς ποτέραν τῶν τάξεων τούτων σαυτὸν δικαίως ἂν τάττοις ;
as you know the category to which each of these species belongs, have you ever considered in which category you ought to put yourself?"

456	ἔγωγ’ , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρίστιππος ·
"I have; 

457	καὶ οὐδαμῶς γε τάττω ἐμαυτὸν εἰς τὴν τῶν ἄρχειν βουλομένων τάξιν .
and I do not for a moment put myself in the category of those who want to be rulers."

"For considering how hard a matter it is to provide for one’s own needs, I think it absurd not to be content to do that, but to shoulder the burden of supplying the wants of the community as well."

458	καὶ γὰρ πάνυ μοι δοκεῖ ἄφρονος ἀνθρώπου εἶναι τό , μεγάλου ἔργου ὄντος τοῦ ἑαυτῷ τὰ δέοντα παρασκευάζειν , μὴ ἀρκεῖν τοῦτο , ἀλλὰ προσαναθέσθαι τὸ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις πολίταις ὧν δέονται πορίζειν ·


459	καὶ ἑαυτῷ μὲν πολλὰ ὧν βούλεται ἐλλείπειν , τῆς δὲ πόλεως προεστῶτα , ἐὰν μὴ πάντα ὅσα ἡ πόλις βούλεται καταπράττῃ , τούτου δίκην ὑπέχειν , τοῦτο πῶς οὐ πολλὴ ἀφροσύνη ἐστί ;
"That anyone should sacrifice a large part of his own wishes and make himself accountable as head of the state for the least failure to carry out all the wishes of the community is surely the height of folly."

460	καὶ γὰρ ἀξιοῦσιν αἱ πόλεις τοῖς ἄρχουσιν ὥσπερ ἐγὼ τοῖς οἰκέταις χρῆσθαι .
"For states claim to treat their rulers just as I claim to treat my servants."

461	ἐγώ τε γὰρ ἀξιῶ τοὺς θεράποντας ἐμοὶ μὲν ἄφθονα τὰ ἐπιτήδεια παρασκευάζειν , αὐτοὺς δὲ μηδενὸς τούτων ἅπτεσθαι , αἵ τε πόλεις οἴονται χρῆναι τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἑαυταῖς μὲν ὡς πλεῖστα ἀγαθὰ πορίζειν , αὐτοὺς δὲ πάντων τούτων ἀπέχεσθαι .
"I expect my men to provide me with necessaries in abundance, but not to touch any of them; and states hold it to be the business of the ruler to supply them with all manner of good things, and to abstain from all of them himself."

462	ἐγὼ οὖν τοὺς μὲν βουλομένους πολλὰ πράγματα ἔχειν αὐτούς τε καὶ ἄλλοις παρέχειν οὕτως ἂν παιδεύσας εἰς τοὺς ἀρχικοὺς καταστήσαιμι ·
"And so, should anyone want to bring plenty of trouble on himself and others, I would educate him as you propose and number him with those fitted to be rulers."

463	ἐμαυτόν γε μέντοι τάττω εἰς τοὺς βουλομένους ᾗ ῥᾷστά τε καὶ ἥδιστα βιοτεύειν .
"but myself I classify with those who wish for a life of the greatest ease and pleasure that can be had."

464	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
Here Socrates asked:

465	βούλει οὖν καὶ τοῦτο σκεψώμεθα , πότερον ἥδιον ζῶσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες ἢ οἱ ἀρχόμενοι ;
"Shall we then consider whether the rulers or the ruled live the pleasanter life?"

466	πάνυ μὲν οὖν , ἔφη .
"Certainly," replied Aristippus.

467	πρῶτον μὲν τοίνυν τῶν ἐθνῶν ὧν ἡμεῖς ἴσμεν ἐν μὲν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ Πέρσαι μὲν ἄρχουσιν , ἄρχονται δὲ Σύροι καὶ Φρύγες καὶ Λ

υδοί ·
"To take first the nations known to us. In Asia the rulers are the Persians; the Syrians, Lydians and Phrygians are the ruled."

468	ἐν δὲ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ Σκύθαι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Μαιῶται δὲ ἄρχονται ·
"In Europe the Scythians rule, and the Maeotians are ruled."

469	ἐν δὲ τῇ Λιβύῃ Καρχηδόνιοι μὲν ἄρχουσι , Λίβυες δὲ ἄρχονται .
"In Africa the Carthaginians rule, and the Libyans are ruled."

470	τούτων οὖν ποτέρους ἥδιον οἴει ζῆν ;
"Which of the two classes, think you, enjoys the pleasanter life?"

471	ἢ τῶν Ἑλλήνων , ἐν οἷς καὶ αὐτὸς εἶ , πότερά σοι δοκοῦσιν ἥδιον οἱ κρατοῦντες ἢ οἱ κρατούμενοι , ζῆν ;
"Or take the Greeks, of whom you yourself are one; do you think that the controlling or the controlled communities enjoy the pleasanter life?"

472	ἀλλ’ ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη ὁ Ἀρίστιππος , οὐδὲ εἰς τὴν δουλείαν ἐμαυτὸν τάττω , ἀλλ’ εἶναί τίς μοι δοκεῖ μέση τούτων ὁδός , ἣν πειρῶμαι βαδίζειν , οὔτε δι’ ἀρχῆς οὔτε διὰ δουλείας , ἀλλὰ δι’ ἐλευθερίας , ἥπερ μάλιστα πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν ἄγει .
"Nay," replied Aristippus, "for my part I am no candidate for slavery; but there is, as I hold, a middle path in which I am fain to walk. That way leads neither through rule nor slavery, but through liberty, which is the royal road to happiness."

473	ἀλλ’ εἰ μέν , ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης , ὥσπερ οὔτε δι’ ἀρχῆς οὔτε διὰ δουλείας ἡ ὁδὸς αὕτη φέρει , οὕτω μηδὲ δι’ ἀνθρώπων , ἴσως ἄν τι λέγοις ·
"Ah," said Socrates, "if only that path can avoid the world as well as rule and slavery, there may be something in what you say. But, since you are in the world, if you intend neither to rule nor to be ruled, and do not choose to truckle to the rulers"

474	εἰ μέντοι ἐν ἀνθρώποις ὢν μήτε ἄρχειν ἀξιώσεις μήτε ἄρχεσθαι μηδὲ τοὺς ἄρχοντας ἑκὼν θεραπεύσεις , οἶμαί σε ὁρᾶν ὡς ἐπίστανται οἱ κρείττονες τοὺς ἥττονας καὶ κοινῇ καὶ ἰδίᾳ κλαίοντας καθίσαντες δούλοις χρῆσθαι ·
 — "I think you must see that the stronger have a way of making the weaker rue their lot both in public and in private life, and treating them like slaves."

475	ἢ λανθάνουσί σε οἱ ἄλλων σπειράντων καὶ φυτευσάντων τόν τε σῖτον τέμνοντες καὶ δενδροκοποῦντες καὶ πάντα τρόπον πολιορκοῦντες τοὺς ἥττονας καὶ μὴ θέλοντας θεραπεύειν , ἕως ἂν πείσωσιν ἑλέσθαι δουλεύειν ἀντὶ τοῦ πολεμε

ῖν τοῖς κρείττσι ;
"You cannot be unaware that where some have sown and planted, others cut their corn and fell their trees, and in all manner of ways harass the weaker if they refuse to bow down, until they are persuaded to accept slavery as an escape from war with the stronger."

476	καὶ ἰδίᾳ αὖ οἱ ἀνδρεῖον καὶ δυνατοὶ τοὺς ἀνάνδρους καὶ ἀδυνάτους οὐκ οἶσθα ὅτι καταδουλωσάμενοι καρποῦνται ;
"So, too, in private life do not brave and mighty men enslave and plunder the cowardly and feeble folk?"

477	ἀλλ’ ἐγώ τοι , ἔφη , ἵνα μὴ πάσχω ταῦτα , οὐδ’ εἰς πολιτείαν ἐμαυτὸν κατακλείω , ἀλλὰ ξένος πανταχοῦ εἰμι .
"Yes, but my plan for avoiding such treatment is this. I do not shut myself up in the four corners of a community, but am a stranger in every land," Aristippus replied.

478	καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη ·
"A very cunning trick, that!" cried Socrates.

479	τοῦτο μέντοι ἤδη λέγεις δεινὸν πάλαισμα .
"For ever since the death of Sinis and Sceiron and Procrustes,"

480	τοὺς γὰρ ξένους , ἐξ οὗ ὅ τε Σίνις καὶ ὁ Σκείρων καὶ ὁ Προκρούστης ἀπέθανον , οὐδεὶς ἔτι ἀδικεῖ ·
"no one injures strangers! And yet nowadays those who take a hand in the affairs of their homeland pass laws to protect themselves from injury,"

481	ἀλλὰ νῦν οἱ μὲν πολιτευόμενοι ἐν ταῖς πατρίσι καὶ νόμους τίθενται , ἵνα μὴ ἀδικῶνται , καὶ φίλους πρὸς τοῖς ἀναγκαίοις καλουμένοις ἄλλους κτῶνται βοηθούς , καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν ἐρύματα περιβάλλονται , καὶ ὅπλα κτῶνται οἷς ἀμυνοῦνται τοὺς ἀδικοῦντας , καὶ πρὸς τούτοις ἄλλους ἔξωθεν συμμάχους κατασκευάζονται ·
"get friends to help them over and above those whom nature has given them, encompass their cities with fortresses, get themselves weapons to ward off the workers of mischief; and besides all this seek to make allies in other lands; and in spite of all these precautions, they are still wronged."

482	καὶ οἱ μὲν ταῦτα πάντα κεκτημένοι ὅμως ἀδικοῦνται ·
"But you, with none of these advantages, spend much time on the open road, where so many come to harm; and into whatever city you enter, you rank below all its citizens,"

483	σὺ δὲ οὐδὲν μὲν τούτων ἔχων , ἐν δὲ ταῖς ὁδοῖς , ἔνθα πλεῖστοι ἀδικοῦνται , πολὺν χρόνον διατρίβων , εἰς ὁποίαν δ’ ἂν πόλιν ἀφίκῃ , τῶν πολιτῶν πάντων ἥττων ὤν , καὶ τοιοῦτος , οἵοις μάλιστα ἐπιτίθενται οἱ βουλόμενοι ἀδικεῖν , ὅμως διὰ τὸ ξένος εἶναι οὐκ ἂν ο

ἴει ἀδικηθῆναι ;
"and are one of those specially marked down for attack by intending wrongdoers; and yet, because you are a stranger, do you expect to escape injury? What gives you confidence?"

484	ἦ διότι αἱ πόλεις σοι κηρύττουσιν ἀσφάλειαν καὶ προσιόντι καὶ ἀπιόντι , θαρρεῖς ;
"Is it that the cities by proclamation guarantee your safety in your coming and going?"

485	ἢ διότι καὶ δοῦλος ἂν οἴει τοιοῦτος εἶναι οἷος μηδενὶ δεσπότῃ λυσιτελεῖν ;
"Or is it the thought that no master would find you worth having among his slaves?"

486	τίς γὰρ ἂν ἐθέλοι ἄνθρωπον ἐν οἰκίᾳ ἔχειν πονεῖν μὲν μηδὲν ἐθέλοντα , τῇ δὲ πολυτελεστάτῃ διαίτῃ χαίροντα ;
"For who would care to have a man in his house who wants to do no work and has a weakness for high living?"

487	σκεψώμεθα δὲ καὶ τοῦτο , πῶς οἱ δεσπόται τοῖς τοιούτοις οἰκέταις χρῶνται .
"But now let us see how masters treat such servants."

488	ἆρα οὐ τὴν μὲν λαγνείαν αὐτῶν τῷ λιμῷ σωφρονίζουσι ;
"Do they not starve them to keep them from immorality,"

489	κλέπτειν δὲ κωλύουσιν ἀποκλείοντες ὅθεν ἄν τι λαβεῖν ᾖ ;
"lock up the stores to stop their stealing,"

490	τοῦ δὲ δραπετεύειν δεσμοῖς ἀπείργουσι ;
"clap fetters on them so that they can’t run away,"

491	τὴν ἀργίαν δὲ πληγαῖς ἐξαναγκάζουσιν ;
"and beat the laziness out of them with whips?"

492	ἢ σὺ πῶς ποιεῖς , ὅταν τῶν οἰκετῶν τινα τοιοῦτον ὄντα καταμανθάνῃς ;
"What do you do yourself to cure such faults among your servants?"

493	κολάζω , ἔφη , πᾶσι κακοῖς , ἕως ἂν δουλεύειν ἀναγκάσω .
"I make their lives a burden to them until I reduce them to submission."

494	ἀλλὰ γάρ , ὦ Σώκρατες , οἱ εἰς τὴν βασιλικὴν τέχνην παιδευόμενοι , ἣν δοκεῖς μοι σὺ νομίζειν εὐδαιμονίαν εἶναι , τί διαφέρουσι τῶν ἐξ ἀνάγκης κακοπαθούντων , εἴ γε πεινήσουσι καὶ διψήσουσι καὶ ῥιγώσουσι καὶ ἀγρυπνήσουσι καὶ τ- ἄλλα πάντα μοχθήσουσιν ἑκόντες ;
"But how about those who are trained in the art of kingship, Socrates, which you appear to identify with happiness? How are they better off than those whose sufferings are compulsory, if they must bear hunger, thirst, cold, sleeplessness, and endure all these tortures willingly?"

495	ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ οὐκ οἶδ’ ὅ τι διαφέρει τὸ αὐτὸ δέρμα ἑκόντα ἢ ἄκοντα μαστιγοῦσθαι ἢ ὅλως τὸ αὐτὸ σῶμα πᾶσι τοῖς τοιούτοις ἑκόντα ἢ ἄκοντα πολιορ

κεῖσθαι ἄλλο γε ἢ ἀφροσύνη πρόσεστι τῷ θέλοντι τὰ λυπηρὰ ὑπομένειν .
"For if the same back gets the flogging whether its owner kicks or consents, or, in short, if the same body, consenting or objecting, is besieged by all these torments, I see no difference, apart from the folly of voluntary suffering."

496	τί δέ , ὦ Ἀρίστιππε ;
"What, Aristippus?"

497	ὁ Σωκράτης ἔφη , οὐ δοκεῖ σοι τῶν τοιούτων διαφέρειν τὰ ἑκούσια τῶν ἀκουσίων , ᾗ ὁ μὲν ἑκὼν πεινῶν φάγοι ἂν ὁπότε βούλοιτο καὶ ὁ ἑκὼν διψῶν πίοι καὶ τ- ἄλλα ὡσαύτως , τῷ δ’ ἐξ ἀνάγκης ταῦτα πάσχοντι οὐκ ἔξεστιν ὁπόταν βούληται παύεσθαι ;
"Socrates asked, 'Don’t you think that there is just this difference between these voluntary and involuntary sufferings, that if you bear hunger or thirst willingly, you can eat, drink, or what not, when you choose, whereas compulsory suffering is not to be ended at will?'"

498	ἔπειτα ὁ μὲν ἑκουσίως ταλαιπωρῶν ἐπ’ ἀγαθῇ ἐλπίδι πονῶν εὐφραίνεται , οἷον οἱ τὰ θηρία θηρῶντες ἐλπίδι τοῦ λήψεσθαι ἡδέως μοχθοῦσι .
"Besides, he who endures willingly enjoys his work because he is comforted by hope; hunters, for instance, toil gladly in hope of game."

499	καὶ τὰ μὲν τοιαῦτα ἆθλα τῶν πόνων μικροῦ τινος ἄξιά ἐστι , τοὺς δὲ πονοῦντας ἵνα φίλους ἀγαθοὺς κτήσωνται , ἢ ὅπως ἐχθροὺς χειρώσωνται , ἢ ἵνα δυνατοὶ γενόμενοι καὶ τοῖς σώμασι καὶ ταῖς ψυχαῖς καὶ τὸν ἑαυτῶν οἶκον καλῶς οἰκῶσι καὶ τοὺς φίλους εὖ ποιῶσι καὶ τὴν πατρίδα εὐεργετῶσι , πῶς οὐκ οἴεσθαι χρὴ τούτους καὶ πονεῖν ἡδέως εἰς τὰ τοιαῦτα καὶ ζῆν εὐφραινομένους , ἀγαμένους μὲν ἑαυτούς , ἐπαινουμένους δὲ καὶ ζηλουμένους ὑπὸ τῶν ἄλλων ;

Rewards like these are indeed of little worth after all the toil; but what of those who toil to win good friends, or to subdue enemies, or to make themselves capable in body and soul of managing their own homes well, of helping their friends and serving their country? Surely these toil gladly for such prizes and live a joyous life, well content with themselves, praised and envied by everyone else?

Yes, I understand the prompt now. Let me intersperse the corresponding English translations for each Greek sentence, following the specific sentence numbers you provided, and ensuring the English fits the Greek without altering the sentence breaks:

500. ἔτι δὲ αἱ μὲν ῥᾳδιουργίαι καὶ ἐκ τοῦ παραχρῆμα ἡδοναὶ οὔτε σώματι εὐεξίαν ἱκαναί εἰσιν ἐνεργάζεσθαι, ὥς φασιν οἱ γυμνασταί, οὔτε ψυχῇ ἐπιστήμην ἀξιόλογον οὐδεμίαν ἐμποιοῦσιν, αἱ δὲ διὰ καρτερίας ἐπιμέλειαι τῶν καλῶν τε καὶ ἀγαθῶν ἔργων ἐξικνεῖσθαι ποιοῦσιν, ὥς φασιν οἱ ἀγαθοὶ ἄνδρες.

"Moreover, indolence and present enjoyment can never bring the body into good condition, as trainers say, neither do they put into the soul knowledge of any value, but strenuous effort leads up to good and noble deeds, as good men say."

501. λέγει δέ που καὶ Ἡσίοδος ·
"And so says Hesiod somewhere:"

502. τὴν μὲν γὰρ κακότητα καὶ ἰλαδὸν ἔστιν ἑλέσθαι ῥηιδίως ·
"'Wickedness can be had in abundance easily:"

503. λείη μὲν ὁδός, μάλα δ’ ἐγγύθι ναίει.
"smooth is the road and very nigh she dwells."

504. τῆς δ’ ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάροιθεν ἔθηκαν ἀθάνατοι ·
"But in front of virtue the gods immortal have put sweat:"

505. μακρὸς δὲ καὶ ὄρθιος οἶμος ἐς αὐτὴν καὶ τρηχὺς τὸ πρῶτον ·
"long and steep is the path to her and rough at first;"

506. ἐπὴν δ’ εἰς ἄκρον ἵκηαι, ῥηιδίη δὴ ἔπειτα πέλει, χαλεπή περ ἐοῦσα.
"but when you reach the top, then at length the road is easy, hard though it was."

507. μαρτυρεῖ δὲ καὶ Ἐπίχαρμος ἐν τῷδε ·
"And we have the testimony of Epicharmus too in the line:"

508. τῶν πόνων πωλοῦσιν ἡμῖν πάντα τἀγάθ’ οἱ θεοί.
"'The gods demand of us toil

 as the price of all good things.'"

509. καὶ ἐν ἄλλῳ δὲ τόπῳ φησίν ·
"And elsewhere he says:"

510. ὦ πονηρέ, μὴ τὰ μαλακὰ μῶσο, μὴ τὰ σκλήρ’ ἔχῃς.
"'Knave, yearn not for the soft things, lest thou earn the hard.'"

511. καὶ Πρόδικος δὲ ὁ σοφὸς ἐν τῷ συγγράμματι τῷ περὶ Ἡρακλέους, ὅπερ δὴ καὶ πλείστοις ἐπιδείκνυται, ὡσαύτως περὶ τῆς ἀρετῆς ἀποφαίνεται, ὧδέ πως λέγων, ὅσα ἐγὼ μέμνημαι.
"Aye, and Prodicus the wise expresses himself to the like effect concerning Virtue in the essay 'On Heracles' that he recites to throngs of listeners. This, so far as I remember, is how he puts it:"

512. φησὶ γὰρ Ἡρακλέα, ἐπεὶ ἐκ παίδων εἰς ἥβην ὡρμᾶτο, ἐν ᾗ οἱ νέοι ἤδη αὐτοκράτορες γιγνόμενοι δηλοῦσιν εἴτε τὴν δι’ ἀρετῆς ὁδὸν τρέψονται ἐπὶ τὸν βίον εἴτε τὴν διὰ κακίας, ἐξελθόντα εἰς ἡσυχίαν καθῆσθαι ἀποροῦντα ποτέραν τῶν ὁδῶν τράπηται ·
"When Heracles was passing from boyhood to youth’s estate, wherein the young, now becoming their own masters, show whether they will approach life by the path of virtue or the path of vice, he went out into a quiet place, and sat pondering which road to
take."

513 καὶ φανῆναι αὐτῷ δύο γυναῖκας προσιέναι μεγάλας , τὴν μὲν ἑτέραν εὐπρεπῆ τε ἰδεῖν καὶ ἐλευθέριον φύσει , κεκοσμημένην τὸ μὲν σῶμα καθαρότητι , τὰ δὲ ὄμματα αἰδοῖ , τὸ δὲ σχῆμα σωφροσύνῃ , ἐσθῆτι δὲ λευκῇ , τὴν δ’ ἑτέραν τεθραμμένην μὲν εἰς πολυσαρκίαν τε καὶ ἁπαλότητα , κεκαλλωπισμένην δὲ τὸ μὲν χρῶμα ὥστε λευκοτέραν τε καὶ ἐρυθροτέραν τοῦ ὄντος δοκεῖν φαίνεσθαι , τὸ δὲ σχῆμα ὥστε δοκεῖν ὀρθοτέραν τῆς φύσεως εἶναι , τὰ δὲ ὄμματα ἔχειν ἀναπεπταμένα , ἐσθῆτα δὲ ἐξ ἧς ἂν μάλιστα ὥρα διαλάμποι ·
"And there appeared two women of great stature making towards him. The one was fair to see and of high bearing; and her limbs were adorned with purity, her eyes with modesty; sober was her figure, and her robe was white. The other was plump and soft, with high feeding. Her face was made up to heighten its natural white and pink, her figure to exaggerate her height. Open-eyed was she; and dressed so as to disclose all her charms. Now she eyed herself; anon looked whether any noticed her; and often stole a glance at her own shadow."

514	κατασκοπεῖσθαι δὲ θαμὰ ἑαυτήν , ἐπισκοπεῖν δὲ καὶ εἴ τις ἄλλος αὐτὴν θεᾶται , πολλάκις δὲ καὶ εἰς τὴν ἑαυτῆς σκιὰν ἀποβλέπειν .
"Now she eyed herself; anon looked whether any noticed her; and
often stole a glance at her own shadow."

515. ὡς δ’ ἐγένοντο πλησιαίτερον τοῦ Ἡρακλέους, τὴν μὲν πρόσθεν ῥηθεῖσαν ἰέναι τὸν αὐτὸν τρόπον, τὴν δ’ ἑτέραν φθάσαι βουλομένην προσδραμεῖν τῷ Ἡρακλεῖ καὶ εἰπεῖν:
When they drew nigh to Heracles, the first pursued the even tenor of her way: but the other, all eager to outdo her, ran to meet him, crying:

516. ὁρῶ σε, ὦ Ἡράκλεις, ἀποροῦντα ποίαν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὸν βίον τράπῃ.
"Heracles, I see that you are in doubt which path to take towards life."

517. ἐὰν οὖν ἐμὲ φίλην ποιησάμενος, ἐπὶ τὴν ἡδίστην τε καὶ ῥᾴστην ὁδὸν ἄξω σε, καὶ τῶν μὲν τερπνῶν οὐδενὸς ἄγευστος ἔσει, τῶν δὲ χαλεπῶν ἄπειρος διαβιώσῃ.
"Make me your friend; follow me, and I will lead you along the pleasantest and easiest road. You shall taste all the sweets of life; and hardship you shall never know."

518. πρῶτον μὲν γὰρ οὐ πολέμων οὐδὲ πραγμάτων φροντιεῖς, ἀλλὰ σκοπούμενος διέσῃ τί ἂν κεχαρισμένον ἢ σιτίον ἢ ποτὸν εὕροις, ἢ τί ἂν ἰδὼν ἢ ἀκούσας τερφθείης ἢ τίνων ὀσφραινόμενος ἢ ἁπτόμενος, τίσι δὲ παιδικοῖς ὁμιλῶν μάλιστ’ ἂν εὐφρανθείης, καὶ πῶς ἂν μαλακώτατα καθεύδοις, καὶ πῶς ἂν ἀπονώτατα τούτων πάντων τυγχάνοις.
"First, of wars and worries you shall not think, but shall ever be considering what choice food or drink you can find, what sight or sound will delight you, what touch or perfume; what tender love can give you most joy, what bed the softest slumbers; and how to come by all these pleasures with least trouble."

519. ἐὰν δέ ποτε γένηταί τις ὑποψία σπάνεως ἀφ’ ὧν ἔσται ταῦτα, οὐ φόβος μή σε ἀγάγω ἐπὶ τὸ πονοῦντα καὶ ταλαιπωροῦντα τῷ σώματι καὶ τῇ ψυχῇ ταῦτα πορίζεσθαι, ἀλλ’ οἷς ἂν οἱ ἄλλοι ἐργάζωνται, τούτοις σὺ χρήσῃ, οὐδενὸς ἀπεχόμενος ὅθεν ἂν δυνατὸν ᾖ τι κερδᾶναι.
"And should there arise misgiving that lack of means may stint your enjoyments, never fear that I may lead you into winning them by toil and anguish of body and soul. Nay; you shall have the fruits of others’ toil, and refrain from nothing that can bring you gain."

520. πανταχόθεν γὰρ ὠφελεῖσθαι τοῖς ἐμοὶ συνοῦσιν ἐξουσίαν ἐγὼ παρέχω.
"For to my companions I give authority to pluck advantage where they will."

521. καὶ ὁ Ἡρακλῆς ἀκούσας ταῦτα, ὦ γύναι, ἔφη, ὄνομα δέ σοι τί ἐστιν;
"Now when Heracles heard this, he asked, 'Lady, pray what is your name?"

522. ἡ δέ, οἱ μὲν ἐμοὶ φίλοι, ἔφη, καλοῦσί με Εὐδαιμονίαν, οἱ δὲ μισοῦντές με ὑποκοριζόμενοι ὀνομάζουσι Κακίαν.
"My friends call me Happiness,' she said, 'but among those that hate me I am nicknamed Vice."

523 καὶ ἐν τούτῳ ἡ ἑτέρα γυνὴ προσελθοῦσα εἶπε ·  
Meantime the other had drawn near, and she said:

524 καὶ ἐγὼ ἥκω πρὸς σέ , ὦ Ἡράκλεις , εἰδυῖα τοὺς γεννήσαντάς σε καὶ τὴν φύσιν τὴν σὴν ἐν τῇ παιδείᾳ καταμαθοῦσα , ἐξ ὧν ἐλπίζω , εἰ τὴν πρὸς ἐμὲ ὁδὸν τράποιο , σφόδρ’ ἄν σε τῶν καλῶν καὶ σεμνῶν ἀγαθὸν ἐργάτην γενέσθαι καὶ ἐμὲ ἔτι πολὺ ἐντιμοτέραν καὶ ἐπ’ ἀγαθοῖς διαπρεπεστέραν φανῆναι .  
I, too, am come to you, Heracles: I know your parents and I have taken note of your character during the time of your education. Therefore, I hope that, if you take the road that leads to me, you will turn out a right good doer of high and noble deeds, and I shall be yet more highly honoured and more illustrious for the blessings I bestow.

525 οὐκ ἐξαπατήσω δέ σε προοιμίοις ἡδονῆς , ἀλλ’ ᾗπερ οἱ θεοὶ διέθεσαν τὰ ὄντα διηγήσομαι μετ’ ἀληθείας .  
But I will not deceive you by a pleasant prelude: I will rather tell you truly the things that are, as the gods have ordained them.

526 τῶν γὰρ ὄντων ἀγαθῶν καὶ καλῶν οὐδὲν ἄνευ πόνου καὶ ἐπιμελείας θεοὶ διδόασιν ἀνθρώποις , ἀλλ’ εἴτε τοὺς θεοὺς ἵλεως εἶναί σοι βούλει , θεραπευτέον τοὺς θεούς , εἴτε ὑπὸ φίλων ἐθέλεις ἀγαπᾶσθαι , τοὺς φίλους εὐεργετητέον , εἴτε ὑπό τινος πόλεως ἐπιθυμεῖς τιμᾶσθαι , τὴν πόλιν ὠφελητέον , εἴτε ὑπὸ τῆς Ἑλλάδος πάσης ἀξιοῖς ἐπ’ ἀρετῇ θαυμάζεσθαι , τὴν Ἑλλάδα πειρατέον εὖ ποιεῖν , εἴτε γῆν βούλει σοι καρποὺς ἀφθόνους φέρειν , τὴν γῆν θεραπευτέον , εἴτε ἀπὸ βοσκημάτων οἴει δεῖν πλουτίζεσθαι , τῶν βοσκημάτων ἐπιμελητέον , εἴτε διὰ πολέμου ὁρμᾷς αὔξεσθαι καὶ βούλει δύνασθαι τούς τε φίλους ἐλευθεροῦν καὶ τοὺς ἐχθροὺς χειροῦσθαι , τὰς πολεμικὰς τέχνας αὐτάς τε παρὰ τῶν ἐπισταμένων μαθητέον καὶ ὅπως αὐταῖς δεῖ χρῆσθαι ἀσκητέον ·
For of all things good and fair, the gods give nothing to an without toil and effort. If you want the favour of the gods, you must worship the gods: if you desire the love of friends, you must do good to your friends: if you covet honour from a city, you must aid that city: if you are fain to win the admiration of all Hellas for virtue, you must strive to do good to Hellas: if you want land to yield you fruits in abundance, you must cultivate that land: if you are resolved to get wealth from locks, you must care for those flocks: if you essay to grow great through war and want power to liberate your friends and subdue your foes, you must learn the arts of war from those who know them and must practise their right use:

527	εἰ δὲ καὶ τῷ σώματι βούλει δυνατὸς εἶναι , τῇ γνώμῃ ὑπηρετεῖν ἐθιστέον τὸ σῶμα καὶ γυμναστέον σὺν πόνοις καὶ ἱδρῶτι . 
if you want your body to be strong, you must accustom your body to be the servant of your mind, and train it with toil and sweat.

528	καὶ ἡ Κακία ὑπολαβοῦσα εἶπεν , ὥς φησι Πρόδικος ·
And Vice, as Prodicus tells, answered and said:

529	ἐννοεῖς , ὦ Ἡράκλεις , ὡς χαλεπὴν καὶ μακρὰν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὰς εὐφροσύνας ἡ γυνή σοι αὕτη διηγεῖται ;
"Heracles, mark you how hard and long is that road to joy, of which this woman tells?

530	ἐγὼ δὲ ῥᾳδίαν καὶ βραχεῖαν ὁδὸν ἐπὶ τὴν εὐδαιμονίαν ἄξω σε .
 but I will lead you by a short and easy road to happiness."
531	καὶ ἡ Ἀρετὴ εἶπεν ·
And Virtue said:

532	ὦ τλῆμον , τί δὲ σὺ ἀγαθὸν ἔχεις ;
"What good thing is thine, poor wretch,

533	ἢ τί ἡδὺ οἶσθα μηδὲν τούτων ἕνεκα πράττειν ἐθέλουσα ;
or what pleasant thing dost thou know, if thou wilt do nought to win them?

534	ἥτις οὐδὲ τὴν τῶν ἡδέων ἐπιθυμίαν ἀναμένεις , ἀλλὰ πρὶν ἐπιθυμῆσαι πάντων ἐμπίμπλασαι , πρὶν μὲν πεινῆν ἐσθίουσα , πρὶν δὲ διψῆν πίνουσα , ἵνα μὲν ἡδέως φάγῃς , ὀψοποιοὺς μηχανωμένη , ἵνα δὲ ἡδέως πίῃς , οἴνους τε πολυτελεῖς παρασκευάζῃ καὶ τοῦ θέρους χιόνα περιθέουσα ζητεῖς , ἵνα δὲ καθυπνώσῃς ἡδέως , οὐ μόνον τὰς στρωμνὰς μαλακάς , ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς κλίνας καὶ τὰ ὑπόβαθρα ταῖς κλίναις παρασκευάζῃ ·
Thou dost not even tarry for the desire of pleasant things, but fillest thyself with all things before thou desirest them, eating before thou art hungry, drinking before thou art thirsty, getting thee cooks, to give zest to eating, buying thee costly wines and running to and fro in search of snow in summer, to give zest to drinking; to soothe thy slumbers it is not enough for thee to buy soft coverlets, but thou must have frames for thy beds.

535	οὐ γὰρ διὰ τὸ πονεῖν , ἀλλὰ διὰ τὸ μηδὲν ἔχειν ὅ τι ποιῇς ὕπνου ἐπιθυμεῖς ·
For not toil, but the tedium of having nothing to do, makes thee long for sleep.

536	τὰ δ’ ἀφροδίσια πρὸ τοῦ δεῖσθαι ἀναγκάζεις , πάντα μηχανωμένη καὶ γυναιξὶ τοῖς ἀνδράσι χρωμένη ·
Thou dost rouse lust by many a trick, when there is no need, using men as women:

537	οὕτω γὰρ παιδεύεις τοὺς σεαυτῆς φίλους , τῆς μὲν νυκτὸς ὑβρίζουσα , τῆς δ’ ἡμέρας τὸ χρησιμώτατον κατακοιμίζουσα .
thus thou trainest thy friends, waxing wanton by night, consuming in sleep the best hours of day."

538 ἀθάνατος δὲ οὖσα ἐκ θεῶν μὲν ἀπέρριψαι, ὑπὸ δὲ ἀνθρώπων ἀγαθῶν ἀτιμάζῃ·
Immortal art thou, yet the outcast of the gods, the scorn of good men.

539 τοῦ δὲ πάντων ἡδίστου ἀκούσματος, ἐπαίνου σεαυτῆς, ἀνήκοος εἶ, καὶ τοῦ πάντων ἡδίστου θεάματος ἀθέατος·
Praise, sweetest of all things to hear, thou hearest not: the sweetest of all sights thou beholdest not,

540 οὐδὲν γὰρ πώποτε σεαυτῆς ἔργον καλὸν τεθέασαι.
for never yet hast thou beheld a good work wrought by thyself.

541 τίς δ’ ἄν σοι λεγούσῃ τι πιστεύσειε;
Who will believe what thou dost say?

542 τίς δ’ ἂν δεομένῃ τινὸς ἐπαρκέσειεν;
who will grant what thou dost ask?

543 ἢ τίς ἂν εὖ φρονῶν τοῦ σοῦ θιάσου τολμήσειεν εἶναι;
Or what sane man will dare join thy throng?

544 οἳ νέοι μὲν ὄντες τοῖς σώμασιν ἀδύνατοί εἰσι, πρεσβύτεροι δὲ γενόμενοι ταῖς ψυχαῖς ἀνόητοι, ἀπόνως μὲν λιπαροὶ διὰ νεότητος τρεφόμενοι, ἐπιπόνως δὲ αὐχμηροὶ διὰ γήρως περῶντες, τοῖς μὲν πεπραγμένοις αἰσχυνόμενοι, τοῖς δὲ πραττομένοις βαρυνόμενοι, τὰ μὲν ἡδέα ἐν τῇ νεότητι διαδραμόντες, τὰ δὲ χαλεπὰ εἰς τὸ γῆρας ἀποθέμενοι.
While thy votaries are young their bodies are weak, when they wax old, their souls are without sense; idle and sleek they thrive in youth, withered and weary they journey through old age, and their past deeds bring them shame, their present deeds distress. Pleasure they ran through in their youth: hardship they laid up for their old age.

545 ἐγὼ δὲ σύνειμι μὲν θεοῖς, σύνειμι δὲ ἀνθρώποις τοῖς ἀγαθοῖς·
But I company with gods and good men,

546 ἔργον δὲ καλὸν οὔτε θεῖον οὔτ’ ἀνθρώπειον χωρὶς ἐμοῦ γίγνεται.
and no fair deed of god or man is done without my aid.

547 τιμῶμαι δὲ μάλιστα πάντων καὶ παρὰ θεοῖς καὶ παρὰ ἀνθρώποις οἷς προσήκω, ἀγαπητὴ μὲν συνεργὸς τεχνίταις, πιστὴ δὲ φύλαξ οἴκων δεσπόταις, εὐμενὴς δὲ παραστάτις οἰκέταις, ἀγαθὴ δὲ συλλήπτρια τῶν ἐν εἰρήνῃ πόνων, βεβαία δὲ τῶν ἐν πολέμῳ σύμμαχος ἔργων, ἀρίστη δὲ φιλίας κοινωνός.
I am first in honour among the gods and among men that are akin to me: to craftsmen a beloved fellow-worker, to masters a faithful guardian of the house, to servants a kindly protector: good helpmate in the toils of peace, staunch ally in the deeds of war, best partner in friendship.

548 ἔστι δὲ τοῖς μὲν ἐμοῖς φίλοις ἡδεῖα μὲν καὶ ἀπράγμων σίτων καὶ ποτῶν ἀπόλαυσις·
To my friends meat and drink bring sweet and simple enjoyment:

549 ἀνέχονται γὰρ ἕως ἂν ἐπιθυμήσωσιν αὐτῶν·
for they wait till they crave them.

550 ὕπνος δ’ αὐτοῖς πάρεστιν ἡδίων ἢ τοῖς ἀμόχθοις, καὶ οὔτε ἀπολείποντες αὐτὸν ἄχθονται οὔτε διὰ τοῦτον μεθιᾶσι τὰ δέοντα πράττειν.
And a sweeter sleep falls on them than on idle folk: they are not vexed at awaking from it, nor for its sake do they neglect to do their duties.

551 καὶ οἱ μὲν νέοι τοῖς τῶν πρεσβυτέρων ἐπαίνοις χαίρουσιν, οἱ δὲ γεραίτεροι ταῖς τῶν νέων τιμαῖς ἀγάλλονται·
The young rejoice to win the praise of the old; the elders are glad to be honoured by the young;

552 καὶ ἡδέως μὲν τῶν παλαιῶν πράξεων μέμνηνται, εὖ δὲ τὰς παρούσας ἥδονται πράττοντες, δι’ ἐμὲ φίλοι μὲν θεοῖς ὄντες, ἀγαπητοὶ δὲ φίλοις, τίμιοι δὲ πατρίσιν·
With joy they recall their deeds past, and their present well-doing is joy to them, for through me they are dear to the gods, lovely to friends, precious to their native land.

553 ὅταν δ’ ἔλθῃ τὸ πεπρωμένον τέλος, οὐ μετὰ λήθης ἄτιμοι κεῖνται, ἀλλὰ μετὰ μνήμης τὸν ἀεὶ χρόνον ὑμνούμενοι θάλλουσι.
And when comes the appointed end, they lie not forgotten and dishonoured, but live on, sung and remembered for all time.

554 τοιαῦτά σοι, ὦ παῖ τοκέων ἀγαθῶν Ἡράκλεις, ἔξεστι διαπονησαμένῳ τὴν μακαριστοτάτην εὐδαιμονίαν κεκτῆσθαι.
O Heracles, thou son of goodly parents, if thou wilt labour earnestly on this wise, thou mayest have for thine own the most blessed happiness.

555 οὕτω πως διώκει Πρόδικος τὴν ὑπ’ Ἀρετῆς Ἡρακλέους παίδευσιν·
Such, in outline, is Prodicus’ story of the training of Heracles by Virtue; 

556 ἐκόσμησε μέντοι τὰς γνώμας ἔτι μεγαλειοτέροις ῥήμασιν ἢ ἐγὼ νῦν.
only he has clothed the thoughts in even finer phrases than I have done now.


557 σοὶ δ’ οὖν ἄξιον, ὦ Ἀρίστιππε, τούτων ἐνθυμουμένῳ πειρᾶσθαί τι καὶ τῶν εἰς τὸν μέλλοντα χρόνον τοῦ βίου φροντίζειν.
But anyhow, Aristippus, it were well that you should think on these things and try to show some regard for the life that lies before you.

558 αἰσθόμενος δέ ποτε Λαμπροκλέα τὸν πρεσβύτατον υἱὸν αὐτοῦ πρὸς τὴν μητέρα χαλεπαίνοντα, εἰπέ μοι, ἔφη, ὦ παῖ, οἶσθά τινας ἀνθρώπους ἀχαρίστους καλουμένους;
On noticing that his eldest son, Lamprocles, was out of humour with his mother, he said: Tell me, my boy, do you know that some men are called ungrateful?

559 καὶ μάλα, ἔφη ὁ νεανίσκος.
Indeed I do, replied the young man.

560 καταμεμάθηκας οὖν τοὺς τί ποιοῦντας τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο ἀποκαλοῦσιν;
Do you realize how they come to have this bad name?

561 ἔγωγ’, ἔφη·
I do; 

562 τοὺς γὰρ εὖ παθόντας, ὅταν δυνάμενοι χάριν ἀποδοῦναι μὴ ἀποδῶσιν, ἀχαρίστου καλοῦσιν.
the word is used of those who do not show the gratitude that it is in their power to show for benefits received.

563 οὐκοῦν δοκοῦσί σοι ἐν τοῖς ἀδίκοις καταλογίζεσθαι τοὺς ἀχαρίστους;
You take it, then, that the ungrateful are reckoned among the unjust?


564 ἔμοιγε, ἔφη.
Yes.

565 ἤδη δέ ποτ’ ἐσκέψω εἰ ἄρα, ὥσπερ τὸ ἀνδραποδίζεσθαι τοὺς μὲν φίλους ἄδικον εἶναι δοκεῖ, τοὺς δὲ πολεμίους δίκαιον εἶναι, οὕτω καὶ τὸ ἀχαριστεῖν πρὸς μὲν τοὺς φίλους ἄδικόν ἐστι, πρὸς δὲ τοὺς πολεμίους δίκαιον;
Now, seeing that enslavement is considered a just or an unjust act according as the victims are friends or enemies, have you ever considered whether the case of ingratitude is analogous, ingratitude being unjust towards friends, but just towards enemies?

566 καὶ μάλα, ἔφη·
Indeed I have;

567 καὶ δοκεῖ μοι, ὑφ’ οὗ ἄν τις εὖ παθὼν εἴτε φίλου εἴτε πολεμίου μὴ πειρᾶται χάριν ἀποδιδόναι, ἄδικος εἶναι.
and I think that it is always unjust not to show gratitude for a favour from whomsoever it is received, be he friend or enemy.

568 οὐκοῦν, εἴ γ’ οὕτως ἔχει τοῦτο, εἰλικρινής τις ἂν εἴη ἀδικία ἡ ἀχαριστία;
If that is so, must not ingratitude be injustice pure and simple?

569 συνωμολόγει.
He assented.

570 οὐκοῦν ὅσῳ ἄν τις μείζω ἀγαθὰ παθὼν μὴ ἀποδιδῷ χάριν, τοσούτῳ ἀδικώτερος ἂν εἴη;
Therefore the greater the benefits received the greater the injustice of not showing gratitude?

571 συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο.
He agreed again.

572 τίνας οὖν, ἔφη, ὑπὸ τίνων εὕροιμεν ἂν μείζω εὐηργετημένους ἢ παῖδας ὑπὸ γονέων;
Now what deeper obligation can we find than that of children to their parents?

573 οὓς οἱ γονεῖς ἐκ μὲν οὐκ ὄντων ἐποίησαν εἶναι, τοσαῦτα δὲ καλὰ ἰδεῖν καὶ τοσούτων ἀγαθῶν μετασχεῖν, ὅσα οἱ θεοὶ παρέχουσι τοῖς ἀνθρώποις;
To their parents children owe their being and their portion of all fair sights and all blessings that the gods bestow on men —

574 ἃ δὴ καὶ οὕτως ἡμῖν δοκεῖ παντὸς ἄξια εἶναι ὥστε πάντες τὸ καταλιπεῖν αὐτὰ πάντων μάλιστα φεύγομεν, καὶ αἱ πόλεις ἐπὶ τοῖς μεγίστοις ἀδικήμασι ζημίαν θάνατον πεποιήκασιν ὡς οὐκ ἂν μείζονος κακοῦ φόβῳ τὴν ἀδικίαν παύσαντες.
gifts so highly prized by us that all will sacrifice anything rather than lose them; and the reason why governments have made death the penalty for the greatest crimes is that the fear of it is the strongest deterrent against crime.

575 καὶ μὴν οὐ τῶν γε ἀφροδισίων ἕνεκα παιδοποιεῖσθαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ὑπολαμβάνεις, ἐπεὶ τούτου γε τῶν ἀπολυσόντων μεσταὶ μὲν αἱ ὁδοί, μεστὰ δὲ τὰ οἰκήματα.
Of course you don’t suppose that lust provokes men to beget children, when the streets and the stews are full of means to satisfy that?

576 φανεροὶ δ’ ἐσμὲν καὶ σκοπούμενοι ἐξ ὁποίων ἂν γυναικῶν βέλτιστα ἡμῖν τέκνα γένοιτο;
We obviously select for wives the women who will bear us the best children,

577 αἷς συνελθόντες τεκνοποιούμεθα.
and then marry them to raise a family.

578 καὶ ὁ μέν γε ἀνὴρ τήν τε συντεκνοποιήσουσαν ἑαυτῷ τρέφει καὶ τοῖς μέλλουσιν ἔσεσθαι παισὶ προπαρασκευάζει πάντα, ὅσα ἂν οἴηται συνοίσειν αὐτοῖς πρὸς τὸν βίον, καὶ ταῦτα ὡς ἂν δύνηται πλεῖστα·
The man supports the woman who is to share with him the duty of parentage and provides for the expected children whatever he thinks will contribute to their benefit in life, and accumulates as much of it as he can.

579 ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ὑποδεξαμένη τε φέρει τὸ φορτίον τοῦτο, βαρυνομένη τε καὶ κινδυνεύουσα περὶ τοῦ βίου καὶ μεταδιδοῦσα τῆς τροφῆς, ᾗ καὶ αὐτὴ τρέφεται, καὶ σὺν πολλῷ πόνῳ διενεγκοῦσα καὶ τεκοῦσα τρέφει τε καὶ ἐπιμελεῖται, οὔτε προπεπονθυῖα οὐδὲν ἀγαθὸν οὔτε γιγνῶσκον τὸ βρέφος ὑφ’ ὅτου εὖ πάσχει, οὐδὲ σημαίνειν δυνάμενον ὅτου δεῖται, ἀλλ’ αὐτὴ στοχαζομένη τά τε συμφέροντα καὶ τὰ κεχαρισμένα πειρᾶται ἐκπληροῦν, καὶ τρέφει πολὺν χρόνον καὶ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς ὑπομένουσα πονεῖν, οὐκ εἰδυῖα εἴ τινα τούτων χάριν ἀπολήψεται.
The woman conceives and bears her burden in travail, risking her life, and giving of her own food; and, with much labour, having endured to the end and brought forth her child, she rears and cares for it, although she has not received any good thing, and the babe neither recognizes its benefactress nor can make its wants known to her: still she guesses what is good for it and what it likes, and seeks to supply these things, and rears it for a long season, enduring toil day and night, nothing knowing what return she will get.

580 καὶ οὐκ ἀρκεῖ θρέψαι μόνον, ἀλλὰ καί, ἐπειδὰν δόξωσιν ἱκανοὶ εἶναι οἱ παῖδες μανθάνειν τι, ἃ μὲν ἂν αὐτοὶ ἔχωσιν οἱ γονεῖς ἀγαθὰ πρὸς τὸν βίον, διδάσκουσιν, ἃ δ’ ἂν οἴωνται ἄλλον ἱκανώτερον εἶναι διδάξαι, πέμπουσι πρὸς τοῦτον δαπανῶντες, καὶ ἐπιμελοῦνται πάντα ποιοῦντες ὅπως οἱ παῖδες αὐτοῖς γένωνται ὡς δυνατὸν βέλτιστοι.
Nor are the parents content just to supply food, but so soon as their children seem capable of learning they teach them what they can for their good, and if they think that another is more competent to teach them anything, they send them to him at a cost, and strive their utmost that the children may turn out as well as possible.

581 πρὸς ταῦτα ὁ νεανίσκος εἶπεν·
To this the young man replied: 

582 ἀλλά τοι εἰ καὶ πάντα ταῦτα πεποίηκε καὶ ἄλλα τούτων πολλαπλάσια, οὐδεὶς ἂν δύναιτο αὐτῆς ἀνασχέσθαι τὴν χαλεπότητα.
Nay, but even if she has done all this and far more than this, no one could put up with her vile temper.

583 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης, πότερα δέ, ἔφη, οἴει θηρίου ἀγριότητα δυσφορωτέραν εἶναι ἢ μητρός;
Which, think you, asked Socrates, is the harder to bear, a wild beast’s brutality or a mother’s?

584 ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι, ἔφη, τῆς μητρός, τῆς γε τοιαύτης.
I should say a mother’s, when she is like mine.

585 ἤδη πώποτε οὖν ἢ δακοῦσα κακόν τί σοι ἔδωκεν ἢ λακτίσασα, οἷα ὑπὸ θηρίων ἤδη πολλοὶ ἔπαθον;
Well now, many people get bitten or kicked by wild beasts; has she ever done you an injury of that sort?

586 ἀλλὰ νὴ Δία, ἔφη, λέγει ἃ οὐκ ἄν τις ἐπὶ τῷ βίῳ παντὶ βούλοιτο ἀκοῦσαι.
Oh no, but she says things one wouldn’t listen to for anything in the world.

587 σὺ δὲ πόσα, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, οἴει ταύτῃ δυσάνεκτα καὶ τῇ φωνῇ καὶ τοῖς ἔργοις ἐκ παιδίου δυσκολαίνων καὶ ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτὸς πράγματα παρασχεῖν, πόσα δὲ λυπῆσαι κάμνων;
Well, how much trouble do you think you have given her by your peevish words and froward acts day and night since you were a little child; and how much pain when you were ill?

588 ἀλλ’ οὐδεπώποτε αὐτήν, ἔφη, οὔτ’ εἶπα οὔτ’ ἐποίησα οὐδὲν ἐφ’ ᾧ ᾐσχύνθη.
But I have never yet said or done anything to cause her shame.

589 τί δ’;
What then?

590 οἴει, ἔφη, χαλεπώτερον εἶναί σοι ἀκούειν ὧν αὕτη λέγει ἢ τοῖς ὑποκριταῖς, ὅταν ἐν ταῖς τραγῳδίαις ἀλλήλους τὰ ἔσχατα λέγωσιν;
Now do you really think it harder for you to listen to what she says than for actors when they abuse one another in a tragedy?

591 ἀλλ’, οἶμαι, ἐπειδὴ οὐκ οἴονται τῶν λεγόντων οὔτε τὸν ἐλέγχοντα ἐλέγχειν ἵνα ζημιώσῃ οὔτε τὸν ἀπειλοῦντα ἀπειλεῖν ἵνα κακόν τι ποιήσῃ, ῥᾳδίως φέρουσι.
But an actor, I suppose, doesn’t think that a question put to him will lead to punishment, or that a threat means any harm: and so he makes light of it.

592 σὺ δ’ εὖ εἰδὼς ὅτι ἃ λέγει σοι ἡ μήτηρ οὐ μόνον οὐδὲν κακὸν νοοῦσα λέγει, ἀλλὰ καὶ βουλομένη σοι ἀγαθὰ εἶναι ὅσα οὐδενὶ ἄλλῳ, χαλεπαίνεις;
And why should you be annoyed? You know well that there is no malice in what your mother says to you; on the contrary, she wishes you to be blessed above all other beings — 

593 ἢ νομίζεις κακόνουν τὴν μητέρα σοι εἶναι;
unless, indeed, you suppose that your mother is maliciously set against you?

594 οὐ δῆτα, ἔφη;
Oh no, he said,

595 τοῦτό γε οὐκ οἴομαι.
I don’t think that.

596 καὶ ὁ Σωκράτης, οὐκοῦν, ἔφη, σὺ ταύτην, εὔνουν τέ σοι οὖσαν καὶ ἐπιμελομένην ὡς μάλιστα δύναται κάμνοντος ὅπως ὑγιάνῃς τε καὶ ὅπως τῶν ἐπιτηδείων μηδενὸς ἐνδεὴς ἔσει, καὶ πρὸς τούτοις πολλὰ τοῖς θεοῖς εὐχομένην ἀγαθὰ ὑπὲρ σοῦ καὶ εὐχὰς ἀποδιδοῦσαν, χαλεπὴν εἶναι φής;
Then Socrates exclaimed: So this mother of yours is kindly disposed towards you; she nurses you devotedly in sickness and sees that you want for nothing; more than that, she prays the gods to bless you abundantly and pays vows on your behalf; and yet you say she is a trial! 

597	ἐγὼ μὲν οἶμαι , εἰ τοιαύτην μὴ δύνασαι φέρειν μητέρα , τ- ἀγαθά σε οὐ δύνασθαι φέρειν .
It seems to me that, if you can’t endure a mother like her, you can’t endure a good thing.

598 εἰπὲ δέ μοι, ἔφη, πότερον ἄλλον τινὰ οἴει δεῖν θεραπεύειν;
Now tell me, is there any other being whom you feel bound to regard?

599 ἢ παρεσκεύασαι μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων πειρᾶσθαι ἀρέσκειν μηδὲ πείθεσθαι μήτε στρατηγῷ μήτε ἄλλῳ ἄρχοντι;
Or are you set on trying to please nobody, and obeying neither general nor other ruler?

600 ναὶ μὰ Δί’ ἔγωγε, ἔφη.
Of course not!

601 οὐκοῦν, ἔφη ὁ Σωκράτης, καὶ τῷ γείτονι βούλῃ σὺ ἀρέσκειν, ἵνα σοι καὶ πῦρ ἐναύῃ, ὅταν τούτου δέῃ, καὶ ἀγαθοῦ τέ σοι γίγνηται συλλήπτωρ καί, ἄν τι σφαλλόμενος τύχῃς, εὐνοϊκῶς ἐγγύθεν βοηθῇ σοι;
Do you want to please your neighbour, for instance, so that he may kindle a fire for you at your need, may support you in prosperity, and in case of accident or failure may be ready to hold out a helping hand?

602 ἔγωγε, ἔφη.
Yes, I do.

603 τί δέ;
What then?

604 συνοδοιπόρον ἢ σύμπλουν, ἢ εἴ τῳ ἄλλῳ ἐντυγχάνοις, οὐδὲν ἄν σοι διαφέροι φίλον ἢ ἐχθρὸν γενέσθαι, ἢ καὶ τῆς παρὰ τούτων εὐνοίας οἴει δεῖν ἐπιμελεῖσθαι;
When you find yourself with a travelling companion on land or at sea, or happen to meet anyone, is it a matter of indifference to you whether he prove a friend or an enemy? Or do you think his goodwill worth cultivating? 

605	ἔγωγε , ἔφη .
Yes, I do.
