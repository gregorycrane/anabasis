§ 1. In a second sea-fight Agesandridas the Lacedaemonian defeated the Athenians. §§ 2-8. Dorieus trying in vain to enter the Hellespont, Mindarus put out from Abydos to escort him, but was met by the Athenians. The two fleets engaged, and on the arrival of Alcibiades, the Athenians drove the Peloponnesians back to Abydos with a loss of 30 ships. The Athenians left only 40 ships at Sestos: the rest dispersed to collect money, while Thrasyllus sailed to Athens to ask for reinforcements. §§ 9-13. Alcibiades visited Tissaphernes, who had now reached the Hellespont, but was arrested by him and sent to Sardis. A month afterwards he escaped to Clazomenae, and thence to Cardia, whither the Athenians had retreated from Sestos. Meantime the Peloponnesian ships, 60 strong, had sailed to Cyzicus. Alcibiades returned to Sestos, and led the combined Athenian fleet, 86 strong, to Proconnesus. §§ 14-15. He took measures to conceal his arrival, and exhorted his troops to fight bravely; for they had no money, while their enemies had plenty from the Persian king. §§ 16-22. Alcibiades surprised the Peloponnesian fleet manoeuvring outside the harbour, and after a hard fight by sea and land captured the whole of it. Mindarus was slain. Cyzicus surrendered to Alcibiades. He exacted money from its citizens, and from other neighbouring states, and established a toll-house on the Bosporus. §§ 23-26. The despatch of Mindarus’ secretary was captured and carried to Athens. The satrap Pharnabazus armed the Peloponnesian fugitives to guard his coasts, and urged their commanders to build new ships at Antandros. §§ 27-31. Story of the exile of the Syracusan commanders at Antandros, and of Hermocrates' accusation against Tissaphernes and expedition against Syracuse. § 32. The Spartan harmost Eteonicus was expelled from Thasos. The admiral Cratesippidas took command of the ships that Pasippidas had collected. §§ 33-34. Agis made a sally from Decelea, but retreated hastily before Thrasyllus. In reward the Athenians voted Thrasyllus 50 triremes and considerable reinforcements. §§ 35-36.

Agis sent Clearchus with a small squadron to the Bosporus to cut off the Athenian corn supply. Clearchus lost three ships in the Hellespont, but with the rest safely reached Byzantium. § 37. Contemporary events in Sicily.

<p>
<lemma>ἦλθεν</lemma>, i.e. to the Hellespont: cp. following notes.
</p>

<p>
<lemma>θυμοχάρης</lemma>: a few months earlier this general had lost twenty-two out of thirty-six ships, when he was defeated by Agesandridas and the Peloponnesians off Eretria in Euboea: Thuc. viii. 95.

<p>
<lemma>αὖθις</lemma>, in a second battle; the Athenian victory at Cynossema being apparently the first (Thuc. viii. 106). Xenophon does not specify the place, but it appears from the context that it must have been the Hellespont.

<p>
<lemma>Ἀγησανδρίδου</lemma>. According to Diod. xiii. 41 after the battle of Cynossema Mindarus sent the Spartan Epicles to conduct Agesandridas' fleet from Euboea to reinforce him in the Hellespont. But on the voyage the whole fleet was destroyed by a storm off Mount Athos, only twelve men escaping. Agesandridas must have been one of the twelve, if Diodorus' story is true: cp.

<p>
<lemma>ἐκ Ῥόδου</lemma>. For the positions of Dorieus, Mindarus, Tissaphernes, and Alcibiades at this time see Introd. pp. xvi, xvii. According to Diod. xiii. 38 Mindarus had sent Dorieus with thirteen ships, which had come from the Italian Greeks to aid the Peloponnesians, to Rhodes in order to suppress a threatened uprising in the island.

<p>
<lemma>ὡς ἤνοιγε</lemma>. This, the reading of most MSS., to which the commentators, comparing i. 5. 13; 6. 21, give the meaning, ‘as soon as he got clear,’ i.e. of the narrow strait of the Hellespont, suits neither Dorieus’ action in beaching his ship, nor the geographical position of Rhoeteum, which is well within the strait some five or six miles from the narrow entrance. Diodorus xiii. 45 even says εἰς Δάρδανον, which is still higher up the strait.

<lemma>Μίνδαρος</lemma>, the Spartan admiral for 411-410: cp. Thuc. viii. 85. ἐπὶ τὴν θάλατταν, i.e. to Abydos; cp. Diod. xiii. 45 εὐθέως ἐξ Ἀβύδου μετά παντὸς αὐτῆθη τοῦ στόλου.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5"><p>
<lemma>εἰς εὐωνόυ</lemma>. Mindarus had moved his fleet from Elaeus to Abydos (cp. Diod. xiii. 45), so that, since Ilium is twenty miles from Abydos, and since he saw Dorieus entering ἅμα ἡμέρᾳ, in all probability the fight must have been renewed the day after Dorieus’ arrival in the Hellespont. Moreover the Athenian ships seem (cp. §§ 2-3) to have sailed from Madytus, fought against Dorieus and returned to Madytus again before the second battle—a process, which, considering the twenty or thirty miles thus traversed, must have occupied several hours. Further, since Madytus was nearly opposite to Abydos, the second battle must have been fought somewhere between the two cities, and consequently much higher up the Hellespont than the first. Diodorus (l. c.) speaks of one battle only, making Mindarus sail down from Abydos to the support of Dorieus at the Dardanian promontory. Accordingly Breitenbach and others, wishing to reconcile the two accounts, regard εἰς εὐωνοῦ as an interpolation.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18"><p>
<lemma>ταῖς εἴκοσι</lemma>. The article is accounted for by the previous mention of the Athenian fleet (cp. i. 6. 26). There is no need to suppose that ἀρίστοις has dropped out of the text (cp. Plut. Alc. 28).
</p>

<p>

<lemma>δεκατευτήριον</lemma>. The establishment of this custom-house was of the greatest importance to Athens now that her treasury was exhausted, and she had lost so many of her subject allies, more especially Euboea: cp. Thuc. viii. 95; cp. also the similar action of Thrasybulus in 390-389, iv. 8. 27, 31.</p>

<lemma>Ἐν δὲ τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ</lemma>. This and the similar formulae in §§ 31-32, 33 seem to mean that all the events here mentioned occurred in the year 410-409, the next year 409-408 beginning at i. 2. 1.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Ἐρμοκράτης</lemma>. The leader of the oligarchical party at Syracuse: after the defeat of the Athenians he had in 412 urged the Sicilians to assist in completing their overthrow, and accordingly had brought a fleet of twenty Syracusan and two Selinuntine ships to aid the Peloponnesians on the Asiatic coast: cp. Thuc. viii. 26, 29, 45, 85.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28"><p>
<lemma>μεμνημένους... ὑπάρχουσαν</lemma>. With this the MSS. reading the phrase λόγον διδόναι has to bear the unusual sense 'to give an opportunity of speaking,' and the words μεμνημένους... ὑπάρχουσαν must then be an appeal made by the generals to their soldiers to give them a fair hearing, when they returned to Syracuse,—an appeal quite uncalled for after the loyalty which these soldiers had just shown them. If however the words be transposed, with Dindorf, to a position

<pb n="7"/>



before ἐλέσθαι, the passage at least becomes intelligible. 'When the soldiers,' it will then mean, 'refused to elect new generals, notwithstanding the news that the present generals had been exiled, and entreated the latter to continue in command, Hermocrates told them that for him and his colleagues to assent to their demand would be an act of rebellion against the home government; but that if any one had any charge to make against himself or his colleagues, both he and they were in duty bound to give an account of their commands. As however no one brought any accusation against them, they consented to continue in command till their successors arrived.' Even with Dindorf's transposition the sense is lame and unsatisfactory. This and the sudden transition to oratio recta together with the irregular use of connecting particles (παρῄνεσάν τε... ἐλέσθαι δὲ... οἱ δ'... οἱ δ') point perhaps to a lacuna or lacunae of unknown dimensions: cp. Critical Note.</p>

<p>
<lemma>νενικήκατε</lemma>. Parallels may be found for this abrupt change to the oratio recta: cp. i. 4. 14, vi. 5. 35, etc.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἡμετέραν... ὑμετέραν</lemma>. There is no need to transpose these words: ἀρετή can very well mean courage and skill in commanding; προθυμία, sc. τῶν στρατιωτῶν, 'zeal in obeying.'

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31"><p>
<lemma>κατηγόρας</lemma>. Thucydides (viii. 85) narrates how in 411 B.C. Hermocrates had accused Tissaphernes at Sparta of playing a double game between the Peloponnesians and Athenians. He is mentioned (i. 3. 13) as accompanying some Spartan envoys, who, at the same time as some Athenian envoys, were to meet Pharnabazus at Cyzicus, 408 B.C. Since Diodorus (xiii. 63) puts his expedition against Syracuse in 409-8 B.C., it must have been shortly after this meeting that he obtained from Pharnabazus the

<pb n="8"/>


assistance described in this passage. Tissaphernes was the personal enemy of Pharnabazus.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Ἀστύοχον</lemma>, the Spartan admiral, who preceded Mindarus: cp. Thuc. l.c.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἐν τούτῳ δὲ ἦκον</lemma>, cp. § 29 ἔμενον ἕως ἀφίκοντο ... ἀπεπέμφαντο. The chronological sequence of events here seems to be hopelessly confused. How could the old generals have at the same time waited for the new ones to arrive and been sent on their way (§ 29 ἀπεπέμψαντο) with promises of future help? Why in § 31 does Xenophon tell the story already narrated by Thucydides (viii. 85) of what had already happened to Hermocrates early in 411, and couple with that his visit to Pharnabazus, which must certainly have been subsequent to his exile, mentioned in § 27 as apparently occurring in 410 B.C.? and why does he insert at this point his preparations for his attack upon Syracuse, which was not made till 409-8 B.C. according to Diodorus (xiii. 63)? How too could Hermocrates have been in Sicily in 409 (or at latest in 408, if Diodorus' date be, as so often, a year wrong), and again with Pharnabazus at Cyzicus in 408? (Cp. i. 3. 13; Freeman, Sicily, iii. p. 727.) Again, to what interval of time does ἐν τούτῳ refer? for the new ships must have taken some considerable time to build. In any case it can have nothing to do with Hermocrates' visit to Pharnabazus and attack on Syracuse, which must be regarded as a parenthetical digression, anticipating the events of the next two years. Perhaps then ἐν τούτῳ may be interpreted to mean the time following the agreement made between the old generals and the army, inclusive of the time required for building the ships. ἦκον must therefore be translated as a pluperfect, 'had arrived.'</p>

<p>
<lemma>εἰς Μῆλητον</lemma>. This agrees with the anticipatory remark of Thucydides (l.c.), who gives the same names.
</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32"><p>
<lemma>ἐν Θάσῳ</lemma>. Thasos had revolted from Athens in 411 B.C., two months after Diotrephes, an Athenian oligarch, had put down the democracy, then existing, in favour of an oligarchy (cp. Thuc. viii. 64), and had since submitted to the government of a Spartan harmost. Now it appears that the popular party under Ecphantus had expelled Eteonicus the harmost and his supporters, and admitted Thrasybulus with an Athenian force just after the battle of Cyzicus: cp. this section with § 12 note, and with Demosthenes (xx. 59), who

<pb n="9"/>



adds that this affair further led to τὸν περὶ Θράκην τόπον entering the Athenian alliance.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἁρμοστῆς</lemma>. In 423 B.C. the Spartans appointed governors in Thrace (Thuc. iv. 131), and in 413 king Agis made Alcamenes harmost of Euboea (Thuc. viii. 5). But it was not till the admiralship of Lysander, 407 B.C., that it became a principle of the Lacedaemonian hegemony to appoint these officers backed up by oligarchies of ten in all the subject states; cp. Diod. xiv. 10 καταστήσαντες δὲ ναύαρχον Λύσανδρον τούτῳ προστετάχθν ἐπιπορεύεσθαι τὰς πόλεις ἐν ἑκάστῃ τοὺς παρ’ αὐτοῖς καλουμένους ἁρμοστάς ἐγκαθιστάντα· ταῖς γὰρ δημοκρατίαις προσκοπτόντες οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι δι’ ὀλιγαρχίας ἐβούλοντο τὰς πόλεις διοικεῖσθαι. Other instances of harmosts in the Hellenica are (i. 2. 18) Labotas in Heraclea, (i. 3. 5) Hippocrates in Chalcedon, (i. 3. 15) Clearchus in Byzantium, (ii. 3. 14) Callibius at Athens, (iii. 1. 9) Dercylidas in Abydos, (iv. 8. 29) Therimachus in Methymna, etc.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Πααηππίδας</lemma>. It is impossible to determine whether Pasippidas was actually ναύαρχος in succession to Mindarus, or whether he merely filled his place till the newly appointed successor Cratesippidas arrived: in either case, since Lysander did not succeed him till 407 (i. 5. 1), Cratesippidas must have held office for at least two years. This long tenure may perhaps be explained by the paucity of Peloponnesian ships after the destruction of the fleet at Cyzicus, which naturally made the admiralship of very little importance, until Lysander, backed by Persian gold, built a new fleet. Diodorus (xiii. 65) dates Cratesippidas' appointment in the year 409, and narrates that he sailed with twenty-five ships collected from the allies to the Ionic coast οὐδὲν ἄξιον λόγου πράξας: that then he was supplied with money by some Chian exiles, reinstated them in the island and occupied the acropolis.

      §§ 1-5. Thrasyllus sailed with his fleet to Samos: he made numerous descents upon the Ionian coast, till he was stopped by Stages the Persian. §§ 6-10. Thrasyllus attacked Ephesus, but was defeated with great loss by the citizens, Syracusans, and the troops of Tissaphernes. §§ 11-13. The Athenians retreated to Notium, and sailed thence to Lesbos, where they fell in with the Syracusans, and chased them back to Ephesus with the loss of four ships. Thrasyllus joined the Athenian squadron at Sestos, and the combined force then crossed to Lampsacus. §§ 14-17. The unconquered troops of Alcibiades refused to associate with the defeated troops of Thrasyllus, until in combination they won a brilliant victory over Pharnabazus at Abydos.

But even so corrected it is very hard to extract any meaning out of them. τοῖς ... ἐχθροῖς is the dat. instead of the nom. by attraction after τοιούτους: the sequence of cases δυνασθείσιν ... λειφθείσας is very irregular, and the clauses ὕστερον δὲ ... βελτιώτοις, αὐτοὺς δὲ ... ἀγαπᾶσθαι ... ἐἴχον χρησθαι, which are manifestly a mere recitation of the acts of the Four Hundred in 411, have neither logical nor grammatical connexion with what precedes.

envoys to Cyrus, but he refused to see them. Lysander had now 90 ships at Ephesus. §§ 11-14. Alcibiades crossed to Phocaea to visit Thrasybulus, leaving his fleet at Samos, in charge of Antiochus, with strict orders not to fight. But Antiochus disobeyed, and drew on a general engagement at Notium, in which he was defeated by Lysander with a loss of 15 ships. § 15. On his return to Samos Alcibiades tried in vain to renew the battle and avenge the defeat. §§ 16-17. On hearing of this affair the Athenians at home chose ten other generals in place of Alcibiades, who, finding himself unpopular also with his fleet, sailed away to the Chersonese. §§ 18-20.

This town was occupied by the Spartan admiral Astyochus 412 B.C. (cp. Thuc. viii. 31), and after Arginusae, 406 B.C., the Peloponnesians fled to it for refuge. But, like Cyzicus, it may have been unwalled, and so liable to occupation by either side, so that there is no need to change τειχίζειν into ἀποτειχίζειν or περιτειχίζειν. Diodorus (xiii. 73) has a different story altogether, that Alcibiades sailed not to Phocaea, but to Clazomenae. Plutarch (Alc. 35) again makes him sail to Caria ἀργυρολογήσων.</p>

Diodorus (xiii. 73, 74) here again gives quite a different account: the general discontent at Athens was, according to him, increased by the accusations of some Cymaean envoys, who complained that, after the battle of Notium, Alcibiades had made a descent upon Cyme and ravaged its land, notwithstanding that it was an allied state. But something must be wrong in Diodorus' account, because Thucydides (viii. 31, 100) distinctly states that Cyme was on the Peloponnesian side. Nepos (Alc. 7) has yet another version, that Alcibiades was accused at Athens, not for the defeat at Notium, which he does not mention, but for his failure in an attempt upon Cyme.

<lemma>ἄλλους δέκα</lemma> 
    Since the battle of Notium must have taken place in the early months of 406, and elections were held at Athens about April, it would seem that Xenophon must mean, not an extraordinary election of generals to replace Alcibiades, but the ordinary elections for the year 406-405, at which Alcibiades failed to secure re-election: indeed Conon and Aristocrates, now re-elected, had been his colleagues (i. 4. 10, 21) in 407-406.

He increased his fleet to 140 vessels, and prepared for battle; but finding himself traduced by Lysander's friends, he assembled the Lacedaemonians and told them that he had come only in obedience to the Spartan government, and was ready to return if they so wished. §§ 6-11. The malcontents thus quieted, he tried to get supplies from Cyrus, but failing, appealed to the Milesians for help, till money should come from Sparta. §§ 12-15. With the supplies so obtained, he sailed to Chios and Lesbos, where he took Methymna by storm, and captured many prisoners; all the Greeks he set free except the Athenians. §§ 16-18. He chased Conon, returning towards Samos, into the harbour of Mytilene, where he captured 30 of the Athenian ships, and blockaded the rest. Cyrus thereupon sent him money. §§ 19-24. Conon by a stratagem contrived to send a ship to Athens with the news. In 30 days the Athenians equipped a fleet of 110 vessels, manned by both slaves and free. §§ 25-28. The Athenian fleet sailed to Samos, and anchored at the Arginusae islands, mustering more than 150 strong. Callicratidas left 50 ships under Eteonicus at Mytilene, and sailed to Cape Malea with 120 ships to meet the Athenians. §§ 29-34. Callicratidas refused to flee before the superior numbers of the Athenians. The fight began; and when Callicratidas fell into the sea and was drowned, the Peloponnesians fled to Chios and Phocaea with a loss of 69 ships. The Athenians retired to Arginusae with a loss of 25 ships. § 35. The Athenian generals commissioned Theramenes and other officers to rescue the crews of their sunken vessels with 47 vessels, while they themselves sailed against Eteonicus at Mytilene. But both projects were prevented by a storm. §§ 36-37. Eteonicus, by spreading false news of a victory, succeeded in despatching his fleet to Chios, and in marching himself to Methymna. § 38. Conon met the Athenian fleet with the news about Eteonicus. The fleet sailed to Mytilene, made an attempt on Chios, and finally returned to Samos.</p>

The name Leon, however, in this passage of Xenophon is attested by the Scholiast on Aristid.

§§ 1-2. The Athenian generals were replaced by ten others, Conon alone being re-elected. Of the six who returned to Athens, Erasinides was accused by Archedemus of corrupt practices, and sentenced by the court to imprisonment.
§ 3. The other generals also, after informing the Council about the battle and the storm, were arrested by its order. § 4. Before the Assembly Theramenes and others attacked the generals for not having rescued the shipwrecked crews, alleging as evidence the official despatch. §§ 5-6. In defence the generals recounted the facts, bringing forward some of the sailors as witnesses. § 7. The defence was favourably received, but, it being dark, the Assembly adjourned without a vote being taken, after commissioning the Council to bring forward a proposal as to the procedure of the trial. § 8. Theramenes availed himself of the Apaturia to excite the Athenians against the accused. §§ 9-11. At the second meeting of the Assembly Callixenus introduced the proposal of the Council, that the people should decide, without further hearing, upon all the accused at once by a single vote. §§ 12-13. Euryptolemus and others threatened to indict Callixenus’ proposal as unconstitutional, but were compelled to withdraw their threat. §§ 14-15. The Prytanes refused to put the question to the vote, but were all frightened into submission except Socrates. §§ 16-33. Speech of Euryptolemus. §§ 16-18. ‘Pericles and Diomedon were chiefly to blame, because they had persuaded their colleagues not to mention in their despatch the orders they had given to Theramenes and others to rescue the crews. §§ 19-22. Two courses were open to the Athenians: the generals might be tried, either before the Assembly according to the decree of Canomus, or before a court according to the law against sacrilege and treason. §§ 23-29. But in either case they ought to be tried fairly and separately. Undue haste ought to be avoided, especially in the case of generals who had deserved so well of their country. § 29. To return to the facts: Diomedon had proposed to rescue the crews, Erasinides to sail against the enemy, Thrasyllus to do both by dividing the fleet. §§ 30-32. According to Thrasyllus’ proposal 47 vessels were told off to rescue the crews, and the rest were to sail against the enemy, but the storm prevented both projects. Many survivors would witness to the truth of this. § 33. On all grounds therefore the generals ought to be acquitted.’ §§ 34-35. At first the people accepted Euryptolemus’ proposal to try the generals separately, according to the decree of Canomus; but at a second vote the Council’s proposal was preferred, and the eight generals were condemned and six of them executed. Not long afterwards the people repented of the injustice.

<lemma>ἐπαυσαν</lemma>. According to Diod. (xiii. 100) the generals from Samos ravaged the territory of the enemy: then Thrasyllus and Thrasybulus returned to Athens and spread defamatory reports about the conduct of the generals at Arginusae. On hearing this the generals drew up a letter to the Assembly in reply. For a time the people were satisfied with their defence, but shortly afterwards, persuaded by the representations of Theramenes and Thrasybulus, they summoned the generals home. All this must have taken some time, so that since the Apaturia (§ 8) occurred early in November, the battle of Arginusae must have been fought some time in August: cp. Appendix, p. 321.</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2"><p>
<lemma>-προεστηκώς</lemma>. It is extremely doubtful whether the designation προστάτης τοῦ δήμου was ever used as an official title in any state, and it was certainly not so used at Athens. The term προστάτης in its legal signification means a patron chosen from among the citizens by an alien (μέτοικος) to represent him before the law courts or elsewhere, where he had no legal right to appear himself. But though this legal signification is sometimes implied in the phrase προστάτης τοῦ δήμου, it seems to be more often used in its simple etymological sense of ‘leader’ or ‘champion,’ and as such is used indifferently side by side with different parts of the verb προίσταμαι. Thus Herodotus (i. 59, 69) speaks of Megacles the Alcmaeonid προεστὼς τῶν παρὰλων, of Sparta προεστάναι τῆς Ἑλλάδος, and of a man gaining a tyranny through προστὰς τοῦ δήμου. Thucydides (ii. 65) says that Pericles προὔστη τῆς πόλεως, and in the same passage traces the ruin of Athens after his death to the quarrels of inferior men περὶ τῆς τοῦ δήμου προστασίας. Pericles (Schol. on Arist. Pax 681) was in fact the last Athenian to unite successfully in his own person the two positions of στρατηγός and δημαγωγός (in the better sense). Cp. Plut. Phoc. 7. Henceforward, though members of the aristocratical families were as a general rule elected to be στρατηγοί, they were distrusted by the people on account of their Lacedaemonian proclivities.</p>
    <p>Men of lower stamp and humbler origin, sprung directly from   
    <pb n="32"/>
    the masses, were therefore preferred before them and contrasted (Lysias, xiii. 10) with them. This new class of demagogues rose to eminence by winning the ear of the Public Assembly: and though they were seldom elected to fill any of the higher offices, yet they exercised an enormous political power chiefly by proposing and carrying ψηφίσματα in the Assembly. Sometimes, however, when they chanced to be members of the Council (Arist. Eq. 774), they had a still more direct control over the executive officers and the financial administration, besides bringing forward προβουλεύματα, which, if passed, were afterwards submitted to the Assembly. But perhaps their most favourite method of showing zeal in the popular cause was their institution of prosecutions against generals and other magistrates (Thuc. vii. 48, viii. 65; Plut. Cimon 15) who failed to pass a satisfactory εὔθυνα or who were otherwise unsuccessful, or against persons who were suspected of being involved in oligarchical (Arist. Eq. 861) conspiracies.</p>
    <p>Usually one such demagogue, like Cleon (Thuc. iii. 36; iv. 21) or Hyperbolus, was pre-eminent over the rest, but it is not to be supposed that the designation προστάτης τοῦ δήμου was confined to one person only: for Thucydides (viii. 65, 89; iii. 75) speaks of Androcles as τοῦ δήμου μάλιστα προεστῶτα, of different persons aspiring to be πρῶτος προστάτης τοῦ δήμου, and of οἱ τοῦ δήμου προστάται at Corcyra. And at the very time when Xenophon in this passage tells us that Archedemus was ὁ τοῦ δήμου τότε προστηκὼς ἐν Ἀθήναις, we learn from Lysias (xix. 48) that the demagogue Cleophon πολλὰ ἔτη διεχείριζε τὰ τῆς πόλεως πάντα.
        
    </p>

    <p>
    <lemma>διωβελίας</lemma>. The most probable explanation seems to be that this was a public dole of two obols first given to poor citizens on the proposal of the demagogue Cleophon (Arist. Ἀθ. πολ. 28), to relieve the distress caused by the war and the occupation of Decelea (cp. Busolt. Griech. Gesch. iii. I. p. 264). Other commentators have identified it with the θεωρικά, the institution of which is ascribed by Plutarch (Per. 9) to Pericles: cp. Philochr. fr. 85. In 410-409 numerous payments were made ἐς τὴν διαβολίαν, cp. CIA. i. 188. Beloch, however (Gr. Gesch. ii. 77 note), refers it to the μισθός δικαστικός, on the ground that the amounts recorded in the inscriptions (16 to 17 talents) were quite insufficient to meet such a public dole, and that Aristophanes in the Frogs 1466 (date
    
    <pb n="33"/>
   
    406 B.C.) complains of the μισθὸς δικαστικός as the crying evil of Athenian finance. ἐπιβολὴν· ἐπιβαλῶν: all Athenian magistrates seem to have had the right of summary jurisdiction within their own spheres of office—in most cases to the extent only of a small fine: if the person so condemned refused to pay, it was the magistrate’s duty to bring him before a δικαστήριον for trial: cp. Lys. ix. 11, xxx. 3; Dict. Antiq. i. 745.     </p>

        <item>§§ 1–5. The Peloponnesian soldiers at Chios, hard pressed by want, formed a plan to sack the city. Eteonicus discovered the plot, and by prompt measures put it down. He asked and obtained from the Chians a contribution of money. §§ 6-7. On the appeal of her Asiatic allies, supported by envoys from Cyrus, Sparta appointed Lysander to be secretary and Aracus to be admiral of the fleet. §§ 8-9. Cyrus, having put Autoboesaces and Mitraeus to death, was summoned before Darius to answer for his conduct. §§ 10–12. Lysander, on his arrival at Ephesus, collected all the ships he could from Chios, Antandros, and elsewhere, got a fresh supply of money from Cyrus, and refitted his fleet. The Athenians made similar preparations at Samos. §§ 13-14. Cyrus, before going up to his father in Media, left Lysander in charge of all the tribute of his satrapy, and warned him against fighting with the Athenians. §§ 15-16. Lysander took Cedreae in Caria by storm, and then set out for Rhodes. The Athenians sailed to Chios and Ephesus, and chose three additional generals. § 17. Lysander sailed past Ionia to the Hellespont. The Athenians put out to sea from Chios. §§ 18–21. Lysander took Lampsacus by storm. The Athenians, 180 strong, sailed in pursuit, first to Elaeus, then to Sestos, where they anchored off Aegospotami, opposite Lampsacus, and offered battle. §§ 22–26. For four days they tried in vain to draw Lysander out of his harbour. Alcibiades pointed out to them the disadvantages of their position, but their generals scorned his advice and refused to move. §§ 27-28. On the fifth day, at a given signal from his scouts, Lysander suddenly rowed across the strait with his whole fleet, and surprised the Athenians while they were scattered along the shore obtaining provisions. He captured without a blow the entire Athenian fleet, except Conon’s squadron and the Paralus, and most of the crews. §§ 29-30. Conon escaped to Cyprus. The Paralus carried the news to Athens. Lysander brought his prisoners to Lampsacus, and sent Theopompus to Sparta to announce his victory. §§ 31-32. Lysander summoned a meeting of his allies at Lampsacus at which they made many complaints of Athenian cruelty. In revenge he executed all the Athenians among his captives, except the general Adimantus.</item>

But, if Xenophon's account of the circumstances be correct, any treachery on his part seems to have been quite impossible, and in the following year it was Adimantus and his party who contrived the assassination of Alcibiades.

<lemma>ᾐτιάθη μέντοι</lemma>, i.e. in contradiction to the pretended reason for sparing his life. The evidence against Adimantus is very doubtful. Lysias (xiv. 38) speaks of Alcibiades τὰς ναῦς Λυσάνδρα μετὰ Ἀδειμάντου προδοῦναι, where he is certainly misrepresenting much of Alcibiades' conduct. Indeed, in another speech (ii. 58), he regards the cause of the disaster as doubtful, εἴτε ἡγεμόνος κακίᾳ εἴτε θεῶν διανοίᾳ. Pausanias (iv. 17, x. 9) preserves the Athenian tradition, that Adimantus and Tydeus were the traitors, the latter being the bitterest opponent of Alcibiades. Isocrates (v. 62) expresses no decided opinion. The accusation of treachery brought by Conon against Adimantus (mentioned by Demosthenes xix. 191) belongs to a much later date, c. 393, after the amnesty of 403. In the midst of such uncertain evidence it is impossible to form a definite opinion either way, especially as accusations of treachery to account for so irretrievable a disaster would lie so ready to hand.</p>

        <item>§§ 1-2. Byzantium and Chalcedon submitted to Lysander, who sent the Athenian garrisons in them and elsewhere back to Athens, hoping thereby the sooner to reduce the city to starvation. §§ 3-4. The Athenians, on hearing of their disaster, reflecting that the vengeance they had taken on many subject states was about to return upon their own heads, resolved to prepare the city for a siege. §§ 5-6. Lysander sailed to Lesbos, where he reorganized the governments of the several states, and despatched Eteonicus to do the same in Thrace. All the Athenian allies revolted, except the Samians. §§ 7-9. Simultaneously the Spartans and their allies under King Pausanias invaded Attica and encamped in the Academy, and Lysander, having restored Aegina and Melos to their exiled citizens, blockaded Piraeus. §§ 10-14. The Athenians maintained an obstinate resistance till all their corn failed; then they sent envoys to Agis with offers of an alliance, but he referred them to the Ephors at Sparta; by whom, however, they were refused permission to enter the country. § 15. Still they would not hear of demolishing their Long Walls, and even arrested Archestratus for making such a proposal. §§ 16-18. Theramenes procured his own despatch to negotiate with Lysander, but after waiting more than three months returned with the information that the Ephors alone had power to make peace. He and nine others were chosen as plenipotentiaries and sent to Sparta. §§ 19-20. An audience was given to them at Sparta, where many accusations were brought against the Athenians, especially by the Corinthians and Thebans; but the Spartans refused to destroy Athens utterly, and offered terms of peace. §§ 21-22. The Athenians, notwithstanding the remonstrances of a few, readily accepted the terms offered. § 23. Lysander and the exiles entered Piraeus and began the destruction of the Long Walls, celebrating the first day of Greek Freedom. § 24. Contemporary events in Sicily.</item></list>

        Though this Aristotelian statement is confirmed by Diodorus (xiv. 3), it is probably mistaken: for not only does it not appear in Plutarch's version of the original document, but it is plain from Lysias (xii. 70) that the constitutional question first arose after Lysander's return after the capture of Samos.</p>

Contemporary events in Thessaly and Sicily. §§ 6-8. Samos surrendered at discretion. Lysander, after reorganizing the government, dismissed the allied fleet, and at the head of the Lacedaemonian ships returned to Sparta in triumph with all the spoils of war. §§ 9-10. A list of the Ephors to show the duration of the war. §§ 11-14. The Thirty delayed to publish the new constitution, and put their own creatures into the Council and other offices. They proceeded to purge the city of all extreme democrats, and to support their violent measures they procured from Lysander a Spartan garrison with Callibius as harmost. §§ 15-17. A disagreement arose between Critias and Theramenes, the former urging a policy of indiscriminate bloodshed. §§ 18-19. To satisfy Theramenes the Thirty nominated three thousand to participate in the government; a measure which Theramenes criticized as at once dangerous and absurd. §§ 20-21. By a stratagem the Thirty stripped all the Athenians, except the Three Thousand, of their arms: they now began a reign of terror, putting to death their own personal enemies and rich citizens for the sake of their money. §§ 22-23. When Theramenes opposed these measures, the rest of the Thirty conspired against him, and Critias openly accused him before the Council. §§ 24-26. Speech of Critias—'The numerous executions were necessitated by the long duration of democracy at Athens, and had the full approval of the Lacedaemonians. §§ 27-29. Theramenes had shown himself not an enemy only, but a traitor; though he had been foremost in making peace with Sparta and in putting down the democracy, he now wished to make his peace with the people and to secure a safe retreat. §§ 30-31. In the past he had been highly honoured by the people; then he had been foremost in promoting the revolution of the Four Hundred, and foremost again in bringing about their fall. Well therefore

        had he deserved the nickname of Buskin. § 32. By such shifts he had 
        caused the death of many; he had procured the condemnation of the generals 
        after Arginusae to save his own life. §§ 33-34. Death was the only 
        punishment meet for such a man. If they should condemn him they would 
        but follow the example of Sparta; while if they acquitted him, he was sure to 
        prove the ruin of them all.’ §§ 35-36. Defence of Theramenes :—‘Really 
        the generals at Arginusae had been the first to accuse him. In alleging 
        the violence of the storm he had offered a reasonable defence, so that in 
        accusing him they had pronounced their own condemnation. Critias knew 
        nothing of the matter, being at that time in Thessaly. §§ 37-40. But 
        it was not men like himself who endangered the existence of the government, 
        but those who had wished to put to death the foremost men in the state. 
        §§ 41-42. He had consistently resisted such measures as the arrest of the 
        metoeci, the seizure of arms, the hiring of the Spartan garrison, the 
        banishment of leading citizens. §§ 43-44. Did such conduct show him 
        to be a friend or a traitor? Surely those rather were the traitors who by such 
        evil counsel had made so many enemies. §§ 45-46. He had indeed 
        turned against the Four Hundred, but only when he had perceived that they 
        had deluded the people with the vain hope of a Spartan alliance. §§ 47, 
        48. He was nicknamed the Buskin for suiting both sides; but what of 
        Critias who suited neither side? He had consistently advocated a moderate 
        constitution, opposed alike to extreme democracy and extreme oligarchy. 
        § 49. If Critias could convict him of treachery to such a policy, he was indeed 
        worthy of death.’ §§ 50-51. Critias, seeing that Theramenes would be 
        acquitted by the Council, arbitrarily erased his name from the roll of the Three 
        Thousand and condemned him to death in the name of the Thirty. §§ 52- 
        54. Theramenes took refuge at the altar, appealing against this illegal 
        procedure; but Critias, relying on the guard he had posted round the Council 
        Chamber, handed him over to the Eleven. §§ 55-56. The Council, panic 
        stricken, passively allowed Theramenes to be dragged away from the altar 
        and hurried to execution. His last sayings.

<lemma>τελευτῶντος τοῦ θέρους</lemma>). It is, however, more probable that Lysander 
        made a special visit to Athens, when he was already occupied 
        with the siege of Samos, and that the appointment took place 
        in June: cp. Grote, viii. 26 note, and Beloch, Gr. Gesch. ii. 109 
        note. Arist. Ἀθ. πολ. 34. 3; Lys. xii. 73. Xenophon passes over 
        all the intervening events, viz. the nomination of five ephors, 
        among whom were Critias and Eratosthenes afterwards members 
        of the Thirty, through the agency of the oligarchical clubs (Lys. 
        xii. 44), the embitterment of internal dissensions, the arrest of the 
        democratical leaders (Lys. xiii. 28), and the invitation sent by 
        the oligarchs to Lysander, who was still besieging Samos, to 
        interfere in the domestic politics of Athens (Lys. xii. 72). When 
        he arrived in Athens, his oligarchical partisans easily procured the 
        passing of the decree mentioned in the text through the Assembly 
        with all the usual legal forms, backed as they were by the threats 
        of Lysander (Plut. Lys. 15), on the ground that the Athenians had 
        not completed the demolition of the walls within the time prescribed 
        in the treaty. Of the Thirty ten were nominated by Theramenes, 
        ten by the five ephors, and ten by the Assembly itself. (Lys. xii. 77.)

<lemma>ἐξέτασιν </lemma>: Arist. Ἀθ. πολ. 37. 2 puts this disarmament after

<p>
<lemma>κελευσάντες ἐπὶ τὰ ὅπλα</lemma>: this phrase, as the passage stands, can 
        only mean κελευσάντες ἰέναι ἐπὶ τὰ ὅπλα, ‘having ordered them to 
        take up their arms,’ ‘to fall in’: cp. Anab. i. 5. 13. But to whom, 
        we ask, was the command given, and who are the ἐκεῖνοι? The 
        passage, as Cobet points out (Mnemosyne, vi. 47), ought to indicate 
        some stratagem by which all ἔξω τοῦ καταλόγου were induced to 
        leave their arms behind them, but no such meaning can be extracted 
        from the words as they stand. Probably there is a lacuna which 
        both Cobet and Dindorf suggest might be filled by some such 
        words as κελευσάντες ἀπιέναι ἀποθεμένους τὰ ὅπλα. J. B. Kan would

        Theramenes, ‘he looks away from both parties,’ ‘faces both ways.’
        Then a stupid copyist, Morus supposes, united the two glosses with

        and ὠφελεῖν depends on δυναμένοις. If, however, the MSS. reading 
        be retained, the sentence is an anacoluthon. Xenophon begins with 
        τὸ μέντοι σὺν τοῖς δυναμένοις (sc. ὠφελεῖν τὴν πολιτείαν) καὶ μεθ’ ἵππων 
        καὶ μετ’ ἀσπίδων ὠφελεῖν, as if he were going on to say τὴν πολιτείαν

        with διὰ τούτων (i.e. διὰ τῶν δυναμένων ὠφελεῖν καὶ μεθ’ ἵππων, κ.τ.λ.) in 
        the same sense as Demosthenes uses the phrase τὰς διὰ τῶν ὀλίγων 
        πολιτείας, and entirely alters the construction. In this case we may 
        translate: ‘but to support the constitution with the help (σὺν) of 
        those who are able to do so both with horses and with shields. . . .
        I say, I used formerly to think that a constitution formed by (διὰ)

<lemma>ἐν τοῖς κανοῦσι νόμους</lemma>: cp. § 11 αἱρεθέντες ἐφ’ ᾧτε συγγράψαι 
        νόμους: and in Mem. i. 2. 31 Xenophon speaks more specifically of 
        ὁ Κριτίας ... τῶν τριάκοντα ὡς νομοθέτης μετά Χαρικλέους. Arist. 
        Ἀθ. πολ. 37. 1 speaks of two laws used against Theramenes, the one 
        arming the Thirty with full powers to put any citizen to death ἔξω 
        τοῦ καταλόγου, and the second forbidding any one to be put on the 
        κατάλογος, who had taken part in destroying the fort at Eetionea or 
        who had in any way opposed the government of the Four Hundred.
        Mr. Kenyon in his note ad loc. says: ‘as to the first of these two 
        laws Aristotle agrees with Xenophon, but as to the second the 
        two accounts differ fundamentally. . . . At best it can only be 
        supposed that Critias instead of striking out the name of Thera- 
        menes from the list of the 3,000, proposed the second law as 
        described by Aristotle and forced it down the throat of the council 
        by threat of armed force.’ Really however the two accounts are 
        quite reconcileable, and a parallel passage in Lysias as to the 
        proceedings of the oligarchs against Cleophon (404) strongly 
        confirms Mr. Kenyon’s hypothesis as the proper solution of the 
        difficulty: cp. Lys. xxx. 11 οἱ δὲ (the oligarchs) βουλόμενοι αὐτὸν 
        (Cleophon) ἀπολέσαι, δεδιότες μὴ οὐκ ἀποκτείνωσιν ἐν τῷ δικαστηρίῳ, 
        πείθουσι Νικομάχην νόμον ἀποδεῖξαι ὡς χρὴ καὶ τὴν βουλὴν συνδικάζειν. 
        καὶ ὁ πάντων οὗτος πονηρότατος (Satyros) οὕτω φανερῶς συνεστασίασεν, 
        ὥστε τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ᾖ ἡ κρίσις ἐγένετο ἀποδεῖξαι τὸν νόμον. Similarly we 
        have only to suppose that on this occasion Critias invented a καινὸς 
        νόμος to meet the case: we need not therefore be surprised that 
        Xenophon has made no mention of this second νόμος ἄνομος: cp. 
        Ἀθ. πολ. 1. c. ὦν (the destruction of the fort and the overthrow of

        the cup to the guest whose turn came next: cp. Cicero, Tusc. Disp.

<p>
<lemma>ἐκεῖνο δὲ κρίνω</lemma>. Here for the only time in the first two books, 
        the noble death of Theramenes draws from Xenophon a remark 
        in the first person. His portrait of him agrees well with that in 
        Thucydides (viii. 68, 89, 92): cp. Aristoph. Frogs 968. Theramenes 
        in the Trial of the Generals does not scruple to sacrifice the lives 
        of others to secure his own. In bringing about the second oligar- 
        chical revolution he is as skilful and successful in his intrigues as 
        he was in the first. So soon as he perceives that the policy of the 
        Thirty is leading them to certain destruction, he opposes them with 
        the same skill as he had used in setting them up; and when at last 
        his opposition brings him into personal danger, the nobler side of 
        his character shines out, till he drinks the cup of hemlock with the 
        courage and cheerfulness of Socrates. But after all that can be 
        said in his favour, it is hard to understand Aristotle’s judgement on 
        Theramenes (Ἀθ. πολ. 28. 5, also quoted by Plutarch, Nicias 2), 
        where he mentions him in the same category with the statesmen 
        Nicias and Thucydides, δοκοῦσι δὲ βελτίστοι γεγονέναι τῶν Ἀθήνησι 
        πολιτευσαμένων μετά τοὺς ἀρχαίους, though at the same time admitting 
        the justice of his nickname of κόθορνος. Beloch indeed (Die Politik 
        Athens seit Perikles 101 and Griech. Gesch. ii. 117), relying on The- 
        ramenes’ own words in § 48, tries to show that he consistently aimed 
        to establish a moderate democracy at Athens, based on the middle 
        classes who had some stake in the state, both when he joined the 
        conspiracy of the Four Hundred in 411, and when he became one 
        of the Thirty in 404 B.C., and that he turned against his colleagues 
        on both occasions, not from a mere wish to save his own life, but 
        because he really disapproved of the extreme form of oligarchy 
        which they had introduced, based as it was upon robbery and 
        murder. From the epithet ὁ κομψός, which is given to him by 
        Aristophanes, we may conclude that he was in the habit of drawing 
        delicate distinctions; and very delicate distinctions indeed are 
        required to free him from the charge of treachery in his conduct at 
        the Trial of the Generals and the capitulation of Athens.

<list>
        
        <item>§ 1. The Thirty expelled all not on the roll of the Three Thousand from 
        Attica. The refugees assembled in Megara and Thebes. §§ 2-7. Thraxy- 
        bulus, starting from Thebes with a few refugees, seized Phyle, repulsed the 
        attack of the Thirty, and made a successful sally upon their camp, his forces 
        being now increased to 700. §§ 8-10. The Thirty seized Eleusis as a 
        place of retreat for themselves, capturing by a stratagem all the able-bodied 
        Eleusinians. Next day they compelled the Athenian Knights and the Three 
        Thousand to condemn all these prisoners to death. §§ 10-12. Thrasybulus 
        marched upon Piraeus, but unable to hold so large a town against the forces 
        of the Thirty, occupied a strong position on Munychia. §§ 13-16. Thraxy- 
        bulus addressed his troops. ‘On the right they had against them the men 
        they had already defeated, on the left the hated Thirty. The gods were 
        evidently now on their side: for victory was certain over an enemy placed in 
        so unfavourable a position. §§ 17. Every one of them must fight, re- 
        membering the high stakes at issue, and the vengeance due to all of them.’ 
        §§ 18-19. Warned by the seer, who was himself the first to fall, Thrasybulus 
        waited for the enemy to attack, whereupon he gained a complete victory, 
        Critias himself being among the slain. §§ 20-22. When after the battle 
        the troops of the two factions met together, Cleocritus, the sacred herald, pro- 
        claimed on behalf of the refugees with Thrasybulus, that they had no quarrel 
        with their fellow-citizens, but only with the Thirty, who in eight months had 
        caused the death of more Athenians than the Lacedaemonians in ten years. 
        The Thirty withdrew their forces to Athens. § 23. At a meeting of the 
        Council open dissension broke out among the Three Thousand, until they voted 
        to depose the Thirty and appoint Ten in their place. §§ 24-25. The 
        Thirty retired to Eleusis. The Ten supported by the Knights kept guard 
        over the city. Their opponents at Piraeus made new weapons and organized 
        their ever-increasing forces. §§ 26-27. Meanwhile they made constant 
        sallies, in revenge for which the Knights ruthlessly butchered some Axioniuns. 
        In return they killed the Knight Callistratus, and soon ventured to march 
        close up to the walls of Athens. §§ 28-29. In response to an appeal 
        from the Three Thousand at Athens and the Thirty at Piraeus, the Spartans 
        sent out Lysander as harmost and his brother as admiral to blockade 
        Piraeus, so that the tables were once more turned. §§ 29-30. But 
        Pausanias, out of jealousy against Lysander, persuaded three of the Ephors 
        to let him head a second expedition to Athens. All the allies followed him, 
        except the Corinthians and Boeotians, who refused to join, and with them he 
        encamped near Piraeus. §§ 31-34. Pausanias summoned the refugees 
        
        <pb n="67"/>

 
        
        at Piraeus to disperse, and on their refusal made a half-hearted attack upon 
        them. Failing in this and in a similar attack he advanced the next day with 
        all his forces and gained a complete victory over Thrasybulus and his 
        supporters. §§ 35-37. Pausanias urged the two factions at Piraeus and 
        Athens to send envoys to him and the Ephors present in his camp; and when 
        they arrived in obedience to his summons, he sent them on to Sparta, where 
        they both tendered a complete submission to the Lacedaemonian supremacy.
        §§ 38-39. The Spartan government despatched fifteen commissioners to 
        arrange the terms of reconciliation. These settled, Pausanias disbanded his 
        army, and Thrasybulus marched up to Athens. §§ 40-42. Speech of 
        Thrasybulus—‘On what grounds did their opponents claim to rule over 
        them? Facts had shown them to be no juster, braver, or wiser than them- 
        selves. Even the Lacedaemonians had forsaken them. Once more he 
        wished his followers to show themselves the better men by keeping their oath 
        of reconciliation.’ § 43. The Athenians then reorganized their constitution; 
        but shortly afterwards, hearing that the Thirty were forming a conspiracy, 
        they seized and slew their generals, but came to terms with the rest, to which 
        ever since they had faithfully adhered.</item></list>

<lemma>ἐν τοῖς ἱππεῦσι</lemma> has probably crept into the text from τοῖς

        should rather expect σὺν τοῖς ἱππεῦσι: and it can hardly mean the 
        Eleusinian Knights, because it appears, from what immediately 
        follows, that the review was of the whole forces, horse and foot

Ἀθ. πολ. 38. 3 the first Ten had been replaced by a second Ten, more favourably disposed towards Thrasybulus and his exiles: ὡς δ’ οἱ τὸν Πειραιᾶ καὶ τὴν Μουνυχίαν ἔχοντες, ἀποστάντος ἁπάντος τοῦ δήμου πρὸς αὐτούς, ἐπέρχοντο τῷ πολέμῳ, τότε καταλιπόντες τοὺς δέκα τοὺς πρώτους αἱρεθέντας ἄλλους εἵλοντο δέκα τοὺς βελτίστους εἶναι δοκοῦντας, ἐφ’ ὧν συνέβη καὶ τὰς διαλύσεις γενέσθαι καὶ κατελθεῖν τὸν δήμον, συναγωισμένων καὶ προθυμουμένων τούτων. προεισήχθεσαν δ’ αὐτῶν μάλιστα Ῥίνων τε ὁ Παιανιεὺς καὶ Φάυλλος ὁ Ἀχερδούσιος. Again in 39. 6 the first Ten are said to have been excluded from the Amnesty. This detail is probable enough in itself; but if it be true, it is curious that none of the other authorities should mention this second Ten—neither Lysias, Andocides, Xenophon nor Diodorus. Isocrates (xviii. 67) even calls Rhinon one of οἱ δέκα οἱ μετά τοὺς τριάκοντα καταστάντες: and Andocides (i. 90), professing to quote the actual words of the Amnesty (cp. § 43), does not mention them. Nepos (Thras. 3) however mentions the exclusion from the Amnesty of ‘decem, qui postea praetores creati superioris more crudelitatis erant usi,’ but says nothing of the Ten at Piraeus.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἔτι καὶ νῦν</lemma>. It is impossible to fix with any exactitude what
        time is denoted by these words. Xenophon accompanied Cyrus
        on his expedition against his brother in 401 B.C., a time which
        allows too short an interval to give the words any real meaning;
        and he did not return to Greece till 394 B.C. On the other hand
        it cannot be very long after the events described, because the
        praise assigned to the Athenians must mean that consistently with
        the Amnesty they did not prosecute certain definite persons, who
        had been implicated in the enormities of the Thirty, and such
        prosecutions were only likely to have taken place in the succeeding
        ten or fifteen years. We may therefore perhaps infer that
        Xenophon wrote these words not very long after his return to
        Greece: cp. Introd. p. xiv.</p>

        <list><item>§§ 1-2. After the expulsion of the Thirty Cyrus sent ambassadors to the
        Lacedaemonians, who instructed their admiral, Samius, to support him.
        Samius secured Cilicia. Cyrus was slain: the Greeks safely reached the
        sea. §§ 3-8. The Ionian cities, threatened by Tissaphernes, appealed to
        the Lacedaemonians. In response they sent Thibron as harmost with
        1,000 neodamodes, 4,000 Peloponnesians, and 300 Athenian Knights.
        On his arrival he collected additional forces, but was unable to take the
        offensive, until he was joined by the Cyreans. Then he captured Teuthrania
        and Halisarnia, and won over several other cities in Aeolia. Failing to take
        Lamsa, he was ordered by the Ephors to march into Caria, but at Ephesus he
        was superseded by Dercylidas. §§ 9-10. Dercylidas came to terms with
        Tissaphernes, and marched against the rival satrap Pharnabazus to revenge
        an old insult. §§ 10-15. This part of Aeolis was governed by Mania,
        the widow of Zenis, who had persuaded the satrap to allow her to carry on
        her husband’s administration. Mania faithfully fulfilled her office until she
        was murdered by her son-in-law, Midias, who seized the cities of Scepsis and
        Gergitha, and tried to make terms with Pharnabazus. §§ 16-28. In the
        midst of this disorder Dercylidas appeared, whereupon many of the cities of
        the Troad and Aeolis opened their gates to him. Cebren too after some little
        delay followed their example. Midias found himself obliged to surrender to
        him Scepsis and Gergitha, in the latter of which was stored Mania’s treasure,
        sufficient to maintain an army of 8,000 men for a year.</item></list>

<p>
<lemma>περιέπλευσεν εἰς Κιλικίαν, καὶ ἐποίησε τὸν τῆς Κιλικίας ἄρχοντα Συέννεσιν</lemma>: Xenophon (Anab. i. 2. 21) does not
        mention Samios, but relates that Syennesis, when he heard that
        Menon’s division of the army had crossed the Taurus by another
        pass, and that Tamos with the Lacedaemonian and Persian ships
        had already arrived in Cilicia, abandoned the Cilician Gates, and
        made terms with Cyrus. Then in i. 4. 2, referring to some twenty-
        five days later, he speaks of the Lacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras
        being on board the triremes at Issus. We must therefore suppose
        that in the interval Samios, at the end of his year of office (cp.
        Appendix, p. 344), must have been succeeded by Pythagoras; unless
        indeed we adopt the far-fetched hypothesis of E. Schwartz (Rhein.
        Mus. 44, p. 193) that Xenophon, still better to disguise his author-
        ship of the Anabasis, has substituted Samios for Pythagoras, because
        the philosopher of that name was a Samian!

        if, as seems most likely, Xenophon wrote the Anabasis before books
        iii-vii of the Hellenica, it seems more probable (cp. Introd. p. xiv)
        that Xenophon for some reason or other wished to conceal his own
        authorship of the Anabasis under a nom de plume. This hypo-
        thesis finds expression as early as Plutarch de Glor. Athen. p. 345 e:

<lemma>πολλοῦ ἄξιος βασιλεῖ</lemma>: Tissaphernes had been the first to inform Artaxerxes of the projected revolt of Cyrus (Anab. i. 2. 4; ii. 3. 18, 19), had fought zealously at Cunaxa against the rebels, and by his treacherous conduct towards the Ten Thousand and their generals after the battle had nearly succeeded in overwhelming the whole Greek force (Anab. ii. 5. 32 ff.).</p>

<p>
<lemma>ὧν τε αὐτὸς πρόσθεν</lemma>. The extent of Tissaphernes' district before Cyrus' arrival is nowhere exactly described. Thucydides (viii. 5) calls him στρατηγὸς τῶν κάτω, i. e. of the coast land, and we find him at that time supreme in the whole region south and west of the satrapy of Pharnabazus which extended over the northern part of Aeolis as far as Aspendus in Pamphylia.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ὧν Κῦρος</lemma>, more exactly described in Anab. i. 9. 7 (quoted i. 4. 3 note). Tissaphernes was thus made commander-in-chief (κάρανος) over all Asia west of the Halys, even Pharnabazus being subordinate to him: cp. iii. 2. 13.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τὰς Ἰωνικὰς πόλεις</lemma>: cp.

Ever since Lysander was left in charge of his satrapy by Cyrus in 405, they seem to have been governed by Spartan harmosts (cp. iii. 2. 20); and when Cyrus in 401 marched eastwards against his brother, they must have become entirely independent of Persia.</p>

<p>
<lemma>πάσης τῆς Ἑλλάδος προστάται</lemma>: cp. Her. v. 49. At the time of the Ionic revolt Aristagoras of Miletus sought help from the Spartans, similarly maintaining Ἰώνων παῖδας δούλους εἶναι ἀντ᾽ ἐλευθέρων ὄντας καὶ ἄλγος μέγιστον μὲν αὐτοῖς ἡμῖν, ἔτι δὲ τῶν λοιπῶν ὑμῖν, ὅσα προστάττει τῆς Ἑλλάδος. It is true that in their three treaties with Persia concluded in 412 (Thuc. viii. 18, 37, 58) the Lacedaemonians had distinctly recognized the right of the Great King to rule over all Asiatic cities, but these treaties they had

        de facto broken by supporting the revolt of Cyrus. According to Diodorus (xiv. 35) the Lacedaemonians immediately sent envoys to Tissaphernes, warning him μὴ ὅπλα πολέμια ἐπιφέρειν ταῖς Ἑλληνίσι πόλεσι, and promised speedy aid. The satrap however at once attacked Cyme, and ravaged the surrounding country.

<lemma>Θίβρωνα</lemma>. Nothing is known of his previous career. Diodorus (xiv. 35-39) gives a very confused and erroneous account of the succeeding campaigns of Thibron and Dercylidas, evidently grouping together the events of 399-397 for purposes of convenience into the annals of two years. Thus he wrongly spreads the command of Thibron over two years 400, 399, whereas it appears from Xenophon (Anab. vii. 8. 24 as well as the Hellenica) that he came to Asia in the spring of 399, and was superseded by Dercylidas in the autumn of the same year. Then he compresses all the exploits of Dercylidas, who held the command until the arrival of Agesilaus in the spring of 396, into the single year 399, breaking off his narrative with the truce concluded between him and Tissaphernes (which really occurred in the summer of 397), and not again dealing with Asiatic affairs until the arrival of Agesilaus.</p>

This language of Xenophon, who throughout (cp. §§ 7-8; 2. 1, 6, 7; iv. 8. 18, 19, 22) seems to betray some animus against Thibron, for which there was probably ample justification, can hardly be made to square with the account of Diodorus xiv. 36. According to the latter, before the arrival of the Cyreian troops, Thibron took the unwalled city of Magnesia near Ephesus, besieged Tralles without success, returned to Magnesia, and put its inhabitants into a place of safety on Mount Thorax. Then he ravaged the country round, until on the approach of Tissaphernes with an overwhelming army he returned to Ephesus.

A similar punishment was invented by the regent Pausanias for his allies according to Plutarch (Arist. 23): τοὺς πολλοὺς ἐκόλαζε πληγαῖς ἢ σιδηρᾶν ἄγκυραν ἐπιτιθεὶς ἡνάγκαζεν ἐστάναι δι᾿ ὅλης τῆς ἡμέρας.

Anab. vii. 7. 23. This makes a total of some 12,300 men.

<div type="textpart" subtype="chapter" n="2"><head>CHAPTER II</head>
<list><item>§§ 1-5. In eight days Dercylidas had won over nine cities. To relieve his allies of maintaining his troops during the winter and of all danger from Pharnabazus, he made peace with the satrap and marched his troops into Bithynia, where he was joined by some reinforcements from Seuthes, king of
           
     
        <pb n="89"/>
  

        the Odrysae. The Bithynians surprised the camp of these Odrysae during their absence, and slew many of the Greek guards within it. §§ 6-7. Dercylidas went to Lampsacus, where he received orders to hold his command for a second year and to enjoin his troops not to maltreat the allies. §§ 8-11. Learning too that the Greeks in the Thracian Chersonese had appealed to Sparta for help against the Thracians, he renewed his truce with Pharnabazus, crossed into the Chersonese, and built a wall across the isthmus. On his return to Asia he laid siege to Atarneus, which had been seized by some Chian exiles: after eight months he compelled them to surrender. Then he went on to Ephesus. §§ 12-14. In response to an Ionian embassy the Ephors sent orders that Dercylidas, supported by the admiral Pharax, should invade Caria. Pharnabazus joined Tissaphernes and the two proceeded into Caria, but so soon as they had garrisoned all the strong places, returned to Ionia, so that Dercylidas was obliged to turn back. §§ 15-20. On the plain of the Maeander Dercylidas found the Persian army drawn out to meet him. Tissaphernes was afraid to fight and proposed a conference; so the two armies separated without a battle. Next day the three generals met and concluded a truce, until they should have consulted their respective governments about the terms for a permanent peace. §§ 21-24. The Lacedaemonians, having long suffered many insults from the Eleans, demanded that they should allow their subject states to be autonomous: on their refusal to comply they declared war. Agis invaded Elis, but on the occurrence of an earthquake retired. §§ 25-27. The war was renewed: Agis led the allied army against the Eleans, and was joined by many of their subject states. Having sacrificed at Olympia without opposition he advanced, plundering and ravaging, as far as the suburbs of Elis. §§ 27-31. Thereupon a faction fight broke out, which ended in the expulsion of the oligarchs, who fled to the Lacedaemonians, now at Cyllene. Then Agis retired, leaving a garrison at Epitalium. Next year the Eleans submitted to the terms dictated by Sparta and entered her alliance.</item>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>
<lemma>εἴη ... κακουργῇ</lemma>: the optative expresses the doubtful possibility of the one clause, the subjunctive the definite necessity, as it appeared to Dercylidas' mind, of the other. For ὅπως ἂν with opt. cp. Goodwin, M. T. App. iv.</p>

<p>

        to the Thracian Chersonese, πότερα βούλοιτο σπονδὰς ἔχειν καθάπερ διὰ τοῦ χειμῶνος. For if the truce were concluded in October, it would expire in June, which was the most favourable time for military operations; whereas Dercylidas reckoned on being absent in the Chersonese for the whole summer. Moreover we are not told in § 9 (which refers to the spring, April) that the truce had already expired. Still it is perhaps better to assume with Breitenbach that Diodorus, whose chronology at this point is wrong in other respects, has confused the duration of the two truces spoken of by Xenophon. On this assumption the first truce must have been made in November or December 399, and Dercylidas probably came back to Asia about the time of the expiration of the second, July or August, 398: cp. §§ 10-11.

<lemma>εἶπαν ὅτι</lemma>. This form of the aorist, mostly preserved in B alone, occurs iii. 4. 4; 5. 24; vi. 1. 16; vii. 4. 4. ὅτι recalls the clause to be supplied from the preceding sentence τὴν εἰρήνην ἂν ποίησαντο: cp. i. 5. 6.</p>

<lemma>ἁρμοσταί</lemma>. Hence it appears that, though by this time Lysander’s Decarchies had been overthrown (iii. 4. 2, 7), the Spartans still maintained their empire over the Asiatic cities by harmosts and garrisons.</p>

<p>
<lemma>σπονδὰς ἐποίησαντο</lemma>. Xenophon has entirely omitted to say what were the results of these negotiations begun in the summer of 397, or what became of the Greek army. Diodorus (xiv. 39) only adds οὕτοι μὲν οὖν οὕτω διελύσαν τὰ στρατόπεδα. Dercylidas himself is casually mentioned in iii. 4. 6 as one of Agesilaus’ envoys in the negotiations with Tissaphernes in the truce concluded in the spring of 396, but from that time he disappears from history until in 394 he meets Agesilaus at Amphipolis with the news of the victory at the Nemea, when the king was marching back from Asia in obedience to the summons of the Ephors.</p>

<lemma>συμμαχίαν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους καὶ Ἀργείους καὶ Μαντινέας</lemma>, in 420 B.C.; cp. Thuc. v. 47. For the motive cp. ibid. 31.</p>

<p>
<lemma>καταδεδικάσθαι</lemma>. This second charge, which Xenophon repeats almost in the words of Thucydides, is narrated by the latter historian, v. 49. The Eleans had condemned the Lacedaemonians to pay a fine of 2,000 minae for violating the Olympian truce, and on their refusal to pay had excluded them from the festival of Ol. 90 (420 B.C.). The insult to Lichas also occurred at the same festival. Thuc. v. 50; Paus. vi. 2. 2.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22"><p>
<lemma>τούτων δ’ ὕστερον</lemma>. The date cannot be determined. Diod. xiv. 17 speaks of the insult as offered to Pausanias.</p>

<p>
<lemma>νόμιμον</lemma>. The custom seems to have been honoured in the breach rather than in the observance. At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War the Lacedaemonians sent to Delphi and ἐπρώτων τὸν θεὸν εἰ πολεμοῦσιν ἄμεινον ἔσται: Thuc. i. 118. Again in 388 or 387 Agesipolis indirectly asked the same question both at Olympia and Delphi: cp. iv. 7. 2.</p>

<lemma>τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ</lemma>, cp. Appendix, p. 341.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τὰς περιοικίδας πόλεις</lemma>. The Eleans had gradually made themselves masters of Pisatis and Triphylia with the exception of Lepreum, and about 465 B.C. had been supported by the Lacedaemonians in suppressing a revolt among the subject towns; cp. Paus. iii. 8. 2; vi. 22. 2; Strab. viii. 355, 358. Now, however, that the Eleans had proved disaffected towards the Peloponnesian League, it was the Spartan interest to weaken them in all possible ways. The autonomy of all Greek States had been the Spartan watchword even before the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.</p>
        <p>Diodorus (xiv. 17) adds that the Lacedaemonians also demanded from the Eleans their quota of the expenses of the war against Athens, and that the Eleans in return charged the Lacedaemonians ὅτι τοὺς Ἕλληνας καταδουλοῦνται.</p>

<p>
<lemma>φρουρὰν ἔφηναν</lemma>: a Lacedaemonian phrase, which first appears in Xenophon. It means ‘to call out the ban,’ φρουρά, like the German Bann, denoting a body of men destined for military service. Generally it is used of a declaration of war by the Ephors or the Spartan state; but in iv. 7. 1 it is used of king Agesilaus alone, and kings Pausanias and Agesipolis are both said ἐξάγειν φρουράν ii. 4. 29; v. 2. 3: cp. Appendix, p. 342.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Ἄγις</lemma>: Diodorus (xiv. 17, 34) gives the name of Pausanias instead of Agis and compresses the events of three years into two. His version is in many respects quite inconsistent.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Λάρισον</lemma>, a river forming the boundary between Achaea and Elis: Paus. vii. 17. 5.

<lemma>δυσμενεῖς</lemma>. This growing hostility towards Sparta, which culminated in the outbreak of the Corinthian war, is noteworthy. Still only the Boeotians and Corinthians dared to refuse the usual contingents required of them.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25"><p>
<lemma>περιόντι δὲ τῷ ἐνιαυτῷ</lemma>, better περιιόντι. Classen (in a note on Thuc. i. 30 περιιόντι τῷ ἔτει) has shown that the phrase can only mean ‘when the year was drawing to a close,’ i.e. about February or March, since Xenophon like Thucydides begins his year about our April: cp. Introd. pp. xxxvi, xliv.</p>

<p>
<lemma>καὶ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι</lemma>: cp. iii. 1. 4.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Αὐλῶνος</lemma>: on the river Neda in the borderland between Elis and Messenia.</p>

The Olympic games were under the care of the Pisatans until Ol. 50 (580 B.C.), when the Eleans were given the management of them. Since their συνοικισμὸς in 471 (Diod. xi. 54) the Eleans had formed a city state and the Pisatans were in comparison only χωρῖται, though they never forgot their old claims to the administration of the festival; cp. vii. 4. 28.</p>

<p>
<lemma>αἱ ἡμέραι </lemma>: according to Her. 1. c. 10 days.</p>

<p>
<lemma>υἱὸς ἔφακον Ἄγιδος εἶναι</lemma>. Plutarch (Alc. 23 ; Ages. 3) relates that Leotychides was a son of Alcibiades by Timaea, Agis’ wife. Thucydides however (viii. 12, 45) does not allude to the story. Pausanias (iii. 8. 4) says that Agis on his death-bed acknowledged Leotychides as his son, but Plutarch (Ages. 3; Lys. 22) adds that he only did so in response to the tearful prayers of Leotychides and his friends.</p>

<p>

Now that Agis was dead and Pausanias more or less in disgrace (for he had only escaped condemnation for his conduct of the war against Athens in 403 through the votes of the judges being equal, Paus. iii. 5. 3), Lysander, whose commanding influence had been checked by the opposition of these two kings, saw a chance of coming once more to the front, if only he could procure the throne for his own nominee: for it was in this light he regarded Agesilaus, whose ἐραστής he had formerly been according to the Spartan custom, Plut.

<p>
        
        §§ 1-4. News coming of a large fleet being fitted out in Phoenicia, Agesilaus, instigated by Lysander, offered to lead an expedition into Asia. The Spartans and their allies consented. Like Agamemnon, he went to offer sacrifice at Aulis, but was prevented by the Boeotarchs. He met his forces at Gerastus and sailed to Ephesus. §§ 5-6. Agesilaus demanded the autonomy of the Asiatic Greeks. Tissaphernes induced him to consent to a truce, while he consulted the Persian king: really however the satrap only asked for reinforcements. §§ 7-10. The Asiatic Greeks paid court to Lysander rather than to Agesilaus. The king in revenge thwarted all their wishes. Thereon Lysander persuaded him to send him to the Hellespont, where he induced the Persian Spithridates to revolt. §§ 11-15. Tissaphernes declared war upon Agesilaus, who at once summoned his contingents to Ephesus. The satrap moved his infantry into Caria, but posted his cavalry in the plain of the Maeander. Agesilaus however marched northwards into Phrygia, gathering rich booty. His cavalry were defeated in a skirmish near Dasycleum. On his return to the sea he took speedy means to improve this arm of his forces. §§ 16-19. In the spring Agesilaus mustered his troops at Ephesus, and drilled them by military exercises and games. §§ 20-24. Agesilaus appointed four of the new Spartan commissioners to various commands. Tissaphernes posted his troops as before. This year however the king really marched upon Sardis. At the Pactolus he was met by the Persian cavalry: but he easily defeated them, and captured their camp full of booty. §§ 25-26. Tissaphernes, being suspected of treachery, was beheaded by Tithraustes, who had been sent to supersede him. The new satrap offered autonomy to the Greek cities, provided that they paid the usual tribute, and induced Agesilaus to move into Pharnabazus’ territory, until he had consulted the Spartan government as to the offer. §§ 27-29. Agesilaus, being entrusted with the command of the navy, appointed Pisander admiral and collected a new fleet of 120 ships.</p>
<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1"><p>μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα: cp. Ages. 1. 6 ἄρτι δὲ ὄντος αὐτοῦ ἐν τῇ ἀρχῇ ἐξήγγελθη βασιλεὺς ἀθροίζων, and Plut. Ages. 6 τοῦ δὲ Ἀγεσιλάου τὴν βασιλείαν νεωστὶ παρελφρότος ἀπήγγελάν τινες with iii. 3. 4.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τριήρεις Φοινίσσας</lemma>. Isocrates (ix. 55) represents Conon the exiled Athenian general and his friend Evagoras the tyrant of Salamis as persuading the Persian satraps, who had fared so badly in their recent campaigns against the Lacedaemonians, μὴ κατὰ γῆν ἀλλὰ κατὰ θάλατταν ποιεῖσθαι τὸν πόλεμον, alleging that εἰ κατὰ θάλατταν κρατήσειαν, ἅπασαν τὴν Ἑλλάδα τῆς νίκης ταύτης μεθέξειν. Similarly Plut. Ages. 6 says that the object of the expedition was

        Λακεδαιμονίους ἐκβαλεῖν τῆς θαλάσσης. Pausanias (i. 3. 1) adds that it was by Evagoras’ personal influence with Artaxerxes, that Conon was appointed admiral of the fleet: cp. iv. 3. 11. Diodorus (xiv. 39) tells the story somewhat differently: according to him, Pharnabazus just before his joint campaign with Tissaphernes (i.e. in 397; iii. 2. 12-20) went up to Artaxerxes and persuaded him to equip a fleet and appoint Conon its admiral: thereupon the satrap sailed to Cyprus, ordered the native princes to equip 100 vessels, and offered Conon the command. Conon accepted, and so soon as 40 ships were ready, crossed over to Cilicia, there to complete his preparations. Diodorus erroneously records these events under 399 B.C., though he does not resume them again till 396 (xiv. 79) without accounting at all for the interval: cp. § 28 note.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἀναγόμενον</lemma>: for the position of the participle cp. iv. 3. 2 αἱ συμφέμπουσαι πόλεις ἡμῖν τοὺς στρατιώτας; v. 2. 4 τὸν ῥέοντα ποταμόν διὰ τῆς πόλεως, etc.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Τισσαφέρνους</lemma>: Herodas naturally reported the name of Tissaphernes rather than of Pharnabazus, because the former was commander-in-chief of the whole country. Cor. Nepos (Con. 2) gives an extraordinarily garbled version of the story.

<lemma>τοῦ  ... ἀναβᾶνι</lemma>: cp. iii. 1. 1, 2.</p>

<p>
<lemma>πείθει τὸν Ἀγησίλαον</lemma>. According to Plutarch (Ages. 23) Lysander urged his friends in Asia to send an embassy to Sparta to ask for Agesilaus’ appointment.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τριάκοντα Σπαρτιατῶν</lemma>. In 429 B.C. the Spartans sent three σύμβουλοι to attend their unsuccessful admiral Cnemus, Thuc. ii. 85. Again in 418 after Agis’ ill success against Argos νόμον ἔθεντο ἐν τῷ παρόντι, ὅς οὔπω πρότερον ἐγένετο αὐτοῖς δέκα γὰρ ἀνδρὰς Σπαρτιατῶν προσελέγοντο αὐτῷ ξυμβούλους, ἄνευ ὧν μὴ κύριον εἶναι ἀπάγειν στρατιὰν ἐκ τῆς πόλεως, Thuc. v. 63. The thirty Spartiatae sent out with Agesilaus were in the following year succeeded by a second thirty despatched by the home government, cp. § 20 and Appendix, p. 337.</p>

<lemma>τὰς δεκαρχίας  ... διὰ τοὺς ἐφόρους</lemma>: cp. iii. 2. 20 note. After the capture of Athens the two kings Agis and Pausanias had successfully combined to crush the influence of Lysander; but no definite measures are known, whereby the Ephors displaced the

        Decarchies, which he had set up in the Asiatic cities: ii. 2. 5; 3. 7; iii. 5. 13. Plutarch (Ages. 6) simply says of them—κακῶς χρώμενοι καὶ βιαίως τοῖς πράγμασιν ἐξέπιπτον ὑπὸ τῶν πολιτῶν καὶ ἀπέθνῃσκον. The reference in § 7 throws no further light on the matter.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τὰ διαβατήρια</lemma>. Xenophon describes these sacrifices Resp. Lac. 13. 2. First at Sparta the king sacrificed to Zeus Agetor; then again at the frontiers he sacrificed to Zeus and Athena.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ταῖς πόλεσι</lemma>. Pausanias (iii. 9. 1-3) states that Thebes, Corinth, and Athens under various pretences refused to send contingents: cp. iii. 5. 5 οὐδ’ εἰς τὴν Ἀσίαν Ἀγησιλάῳ συστρατεύουσι (sc. οἱ Θηβαῖοι). ὅπου παρέμεινα, i.e. Gerastus (§ 4) in the southern point of Euboea.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τοὺς ... αὔξοντας</lemma>, sc. ἐμέ. Breitenbach wishes to emphasize the difference between ποιεῖν and πράττειν, translating, ‘You are benefited towards me more reasonably than I acted (i.e. when I helped you to the throne),’ But Büchsenschütz is probably right in thinking that the two words are used almost indifferently, adducing as parallels Mem. i. 2. 29 ἀλλ’ εἰ καὶ μηδὲν αὐτὸς πονηρὸν ποιῶν ἐκείνους φαῦλα πράττοντας ὁρῶν ἐπῄνει, δικαίως ἂν ἐπιτιμᾶτο and Dem. iv. 5 οὐδὲ ἀν ὧν νυνὶ πεποίῃκε ἔπαξεν. Plutarch seems to have read λέγεις instead of ποιεῖς, Lys. 23 Ἀλλ’ ὡς μέν, ὦ Ἀγησίλαε, σοὶ λέλεκται κάλλιον ἢ ἐμοὶ πέπρακται, and Ages. 8 Ἀλλ’ ἴσως, ἔφη, ταῦτά σου λέλεκται βελτίον ἢ ἐμοὶ πέπρακται.</p>

<lemma>ἔπεσον ... ἔφευγον</lemma>. The river separated the Persians from their camp. The aorist means that in the rout some of them fell into the river and were slain; the imperfect, that the rest made their way through the river and continued their flight.</p>

<lemma>Τισσαφέρνης ἐν Σάρδεσιν</lemma>. This statement of an eyewitness is doubtless to be preferred: but both Diodorus (l.c.) and Plutarch represent Tissaphernes as commanding his cavalry in person at the first successful skirmish, and the former definitely states that after this defeat—ἀπὸ τῆς μάχης Τισσαφέρνης ... εἰς Σάρδεις ἀπεχώρησε.</p>

Artaxerxes was also incited to punish Tissaphernes by his mother Parysatis, who had never forgiven the satrap for accusing her younger son Cyrus of designs against his brother: Anab. i. 1. 3; Hell. iii. 1. 3.

<lemma>ἐξ ὧν</lemma> = ἐκ τούτων ἅς, i.e. "consisting of those ships which," etc. Xenophon has said nothing about the Lacedaemonian fleet since the orders given to the admiral Pharax in 397 to support Dercylidas in an attack upon Caria (iii. 2. 12-14). According to Diod. (xiv. 79, cp. § 1 note) in 396 Pharax with 120 ships besieged Conon in Caunus, who was in command of only 40 ships, but on the Caunians receiving reinforcements from Artaxerxes and Pharnabazus he was obliged to raise the siege and retire to Rhodes.
        <pb n="110"/>     
        Meanwhile Conon, now at the head of 80 ships, had sailed to the Cnidian Chersonese. The Rhodians thereupon revolted, expelled Pharax, and opened their harbour to Conon. Agesilaus must therefore have received these orders from home about strengthening the Lacedaemonian fleet with a view to crushing the rising power of Conon before it was too late: cp. iv. 3. 10 note; Paus. vi. 7. 2; Justin vi. 2.

        §§ 1-2. Tithraustes sent Timocrates to Greece to stir up war against Sparta. The latter distributed fifty talents in Thebes, Corinth and Argos. The Athenians took none of the money. §§ 3-7. The Thebans stirred up a quarrel between the Locrians and Phocians. The Thebans supported the former; the latter appealed to Sparta. The Lacedaemonians were glad of a pretext to declare war against the Thebans, and sent Lysander forward to collect forces at Haliartus, where Pausanias was to meet him with the Peloponnesian army. §§ 7-16. The Thebans sent envoys to Athens, who advocated for many reasons an alliance between the two states. The Assembly voted to enter into a defensive alliance, and Thrasybulus communicated the decree to the Thebans. §§ 17-21. War began. Lysander without waiting for Pausanias attacked Haliartus and was slain, whereupon his allied forces dispersed. §§ 21-25. Pausanias arrived on the scene and next day the Athenian contingent joined the Thebans. The Spartans applied to the Thebans for the recovery of the corpses, which was only granted on condition that they left the country. On his return Pausanias was condemned to death, but escaped to Tegea.</item></list>

<p>
<lemma>ἐν Θήβαις</lemma>, The Thebans seem to have used the Persian gold to coin money bearing the impress of Heracles and the Snake. Then after the battle of Cnidus, 394, many of the Asiatic states—Rhodes, Cnidus, Iasos, Samos, Ephesus, and later on Lampsacus, Cyzicus, and even Croton and Zacynthus in Europe—adopted this type, entering, it would seem, into some close relationship with Thebes, and forming themselves into some sort of League, in all probability to protect themselves against Sparta (cp. A. Holm, History of Greece, vol. iii. 48; Head, Coins, pp. 40, 41). The coins of Rhodes, Cnidus, Iasos, Samos and Ephesus are inscribed with ΣΥΝ.</p>

Ages. 15 states the contrary, τοσούτων (τοξοτῶν, i.e. darics) γὰρ εἰς Ἀθήνας καὶ Θήβας κομισθέντων καὶ διαδοθέντων τοῖς δημαγωγοῖς,: and Pausanias (iii. 9.8) actually names Cephalus and Epicrates as the recipients. Curiously enough Head (Coins, p. 314) is of opinion that a gold coinage was first instituted at Athens about 394.</p>

<p>
<lemma>συνίστασαν καὶ τὰς μεγίστας πόλεις</lemma>. In the following sections Xenophon speaks only of the league formed between the Thebans and Athenians. But Diodorus (xiv. 81, 82) relates that after the death of Lysander the Corinthians and Argives also joined the league, and their example was speedily followed by the whole of Euboea, the Leucadians, Acarnanians, Ambraciots, and Chalcidians.

<lemma>οἱ ἐν ταῖς Θηβαῖς ... πείθουσι</lemma>. Similarly Isocrates (xiv. 27) γενομένου δὲ τοῦ Κορυθιακοῦ πολέμου διὰ τὴν ὕβριν τὴν τούτων (the Thebans). Grote (ix. 113) calls in question this statement, that the Thebans instigated the war between the Locrians and Phocians, thinking that it is due to Xenophon's philo-Laconian and miso-Theban tendency: but the evidence from inscriptions (cp. § 1 note) shows that the Thebans at this time were carrying on a far more energetic foreign policy than had been previously supposed. Xenophon's account moreover is borne out by Pausanias (iii. 9. 9), so that Diodorus' jejune version of the affair (xiv. 81), on which Grote relies, but which says nothing about the Locrians at all, cannot be taken to counterbalance the united testimony of the two other authorities.</p>

These words must mean: 'the claim they put forward at Decelea to the tithe dedicated to Apollo,' i.e. at the conclusion of the Peloponnesian War; cp. Justin v. 10. 12 interea Thebani Corinthiique legatos ad Lacedaemonios mittunt, qui ex manubiis portionem praedae communis belli periculoque peterent. quibus negatis non quidem aperte bellum adversus Lacedaemonios decernunt, sed tacitis animis tantam iram concipiunt, ut subesse bellum intelligi posset. Plut. Lys. 27 τῆς δεκάτης ἀντεποιήσαντο τοῦ πολέμου Θηβαῖοι μόνοι, τῶν ἄλλων συμμάχων ἠσυχάζοντων. As neither of these authorities mention Apollo or Decelea (indeed the booty, we learn, was conveyed by Lysander to Sparta), Breitenbach wishes to read τῆς δεκάτης τῆς ἐκ Λείας.</p>

        §§1-14. Agesilaus ravaged Phrygia, winning many cities over to his side and entered Paphlagonia, where at the instigation of Spithridates he formed an alliance with its king, Otys. He also arranged a marriage between Otys and Spithridates' daughter. §§15-28. Agesilaus wintered at Dascyleum. His foragers were worsted in a skirmish with Pharnabazus. Herippidas, informed by Spithridates that the satrap was encamped at Cava, successfully surprised the camp; but a quarrel over the booty led to the desertion of Spithridates and the Paphlagonians to Sardis - much to the vexation of Agesilaus. §§29-41. An interview was arranged between Agesilaus and Pharnabazus, from which, though Pharnabazus declined Agesilaus' offers, they parted mutual friends, the king promising to leave the satrap's territory. Agesilaus also formed a warm attachment to Pharnabazus' son.</item></list>

        §§ 1-8. The Spartans recalled Agesilaus, who with much regret prepared to obey the summons. He left Euxenus behind him with 4,000 men, and set out across the Hellespont at the head of a large and well-appointed army. §§ 9-15. Aristodemus commanded the Spartan army. The enemy assembled at Corinth, and following the advice of Timolaus resolved to advance upon Sparta. But when they had marched as far as the Nemea, the Lacedaemonians were already at Sicyon, and continued their advance till they were only ten stades distant from the enemy. §§ 16-17. The Lacedaemonians numbered 13,500 foot and 600 horse besides light troops: the enemy mustered 24,000 foot, 1,550 horse, besides a considerable body of light troops. §§ 18-23. Battle of the Nemea—In engaging both armies swerved towards the right. The Lacedaemonians on the right wing far outflanked the Athenians opposed to them and easily defeated them, though all their allies were fairly beaten. The Lacedaemonians, however, successively routed the Argives, Corinthians, and some of the Thebans, as they returned from their pursuit, and thus finally gained the victory.</p>

Of hoplites Xenophon's items give a total to the Lacedaemonians of 13,500, and to the enemy of 24,000. But on the Lacedaemonian side the contingents of some of the states do not seem to be mentioned: for he has not included the Tegeatae and Mantinean contingents of which he himself speaks in § 13, nor again the Achaeans over against whom the Athenians were at first posted, § 18. Diodorus (xiv. 82) does not help us to solve the difficulty: he estimates the Lacedaemonian infantry at 23,000, and the Corinthian and their allies at only 15,000.</p>

        §§ 1-2. At Amphipolis Dercylidas met Agesilaus with the news of the victory and was sent by the king to Asia to encourage the allies with these tidings. §§ 3-9. As he marched across Thessaly, Agesilaus was much annoyed by the Thessalian cavalry hanging on his rear. At last he ordered his own cavalry to charge them: they were completely routed, and he then continued his march without hindrance as far as Boeotia. §§ 10-14. On the frontiers Agesilaus heard of the defeat and death of the admiral Pisander at Cnidus. To keep up the heart of his soldiers he announced that Pisander had been killed in the moment of victory. §§ 15-20. Battle of Coronea—The hostile forces met on the plain of Coronea. The Argives fled before Agesilaus, who commanded the right wing, without a blow. Herippidas and the Asiatic allies were victorious in the center: but on the left the Thebans cut completely through the Orchomenians. Then they tried to make their way to their allies, who had fled to the slopes of Helicon. Agesilaus intercepted them so that only a portion fought their way through. §§ 21-23. Next

        day Agesilaus ordered a trophy to be set up, and the Thebans sent heralds to recover their dead.

<lemma>Θετταλίαν</lemma>: cp. Introd. p. xxix. Xenophon has omitted altogether to record the expedition of Ismenias the Theban northwards in the winter months, 395-394. From Diod. (xiv. 82) it appears that Ismenias at the head of 2,000 Boeotians and Argives first helped Medius, the tyrant of Larisa, to expel the Lacedaemonian garrison from Pharsalus, and then marching southwards seized Heraclea, slew all the Lacedaemonians in it, drove out the Peloponnesian colonists and restored the city to the Trachinians (cp. iii. 5. 6 note). Shortly afterwards Ismenias persuaded the Aenianes and Athamanes to revolt from Sparta, and defeated the Phocians under the command of the Lacedaemonian Alcisthenes at Naryx in Locris.</p>
        <p>From this section it seems that the appearance of Ismenias in Thessaly had even been more far reaching in its effects than Diodorus records: for the Crannonians and Scotussians as well as the Larisaeans and Pharsalians are called σύμμαχοι Βοιωτοῖς, and

The article is noticeable: it seems to imply that the sea-fight off Cnidus is already well known to the reader, although Xenophon has related none of the circumstances that led up to it. In fact not a word has been said about the Lacedaemonian fleet, since Agesilaus appointed his brother-in-law Pisander as its admiral in the summer of 395 (iii. 4. 29). Pisander apparently
        <pb n="130"/>

        (if we follow Diod. xiv. 79, 81, 83) during the next twelve months accomplished absolutely nothing either against Rhodes or against Conon: Conon too was prevented from continuing his successes for want of supplies, until—probably in the winter six months 395-394—he himself undertook a journey to lay his case in person before Artaxerxes at Babylon. His mission was completely successful. The Persian king promised him the necessary money and supplies, and more important still, allowed him to choose whom he would among the Persian officials to collect them. Conon’s choice fell upon Pharnabazus, who was at the time smarting under the invasion of Agesilaus. Accordingly next summer Conon and Pharnabazus put to sea with a fleet of more than 90 vessels, and cruised about Loryma in the Cnidian Chersonese, where, on hearing that the enemy’s fleet was at Cnidus, they prepared for battle. The Spartan admiral sailed out of Cnidus at the head of 85 vessels and put in to Physcus in the same peninsula. Just outside the two fleets met in battle; Conon was victorious and Pisander himself was slain. Cp. iv. 8. 1; Isocr. v. 61-64; ix. 52-57; Cor. Nep.

<p>
<lemma>ἔμπροσθεν αὐτοῦ</lemma>. Diodorus also (xiv. 83) speaks of Pisander as at first successfully engaging with ταῖς προπλεούσαις ναυσί: but, when the Persian triremes came up, he goes on to say, the Peloponnesian allies fled to land, and Pisander, left alone, fell fighting bravely. Conon pursued the Lacedaemonians to the shore and captured 50 triremes and 500 men. But most of the crews and the rest of the triremes escaped in safety to Cnidus.

            §§ 1-3. The army was disbanded and Agesilaus sailed home. When the war was renewed, the Boeotians and their allies made Corinth, the Lacedaemonians Sicyon, their headquarters. To prevent the oligarchical party from joining the Lacedaemonians the Corinthian democrats massacred many of them during the Eucleia.</item>
<item>§§ 4-14. The younger oligarchs mostly escaped. Two of their number secretly admitted Praxitas, the Lacedaemonian polemarch at Sicyon, within the Long Walls of Corinth. The democrats and their allies tried in vain to dislodge him. After his victory Praxitas pulled down portions of the Long Walls, put garrisons in Sidus, Crommyon and Epieicia, and then returned to Sparta. All further operations on a large scale ceased, though the garrisons of the contending parties in Corinth and Sicyon carried on the war vigorously.</item>
<item>§§ 15-17. To protect themselves <pb n="134"/> from the ravages of Iphicrates’ peltasts the Phliasians admitted a Lacedaemonian garrison within their walls. These peltasts spread terror everywhere among the Lacedaemonian allies, only the Spartans themselves daring to meet them.</item>

<p>
<lemma>ἐκ Σικυῶνος</lemma>. In iv. 2. 23 Xenophon said nothing of what became of Aristodemus’ army after the battle of Corinth. From iv. 3. 15 it appears that one regiment of it (μόρα) joined Agesilaus in Boeotia: probably therefore when it was disbanded, a strong force was left at Sicyon.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἀποθνῄσκοντας</lemma>: Stephanus inserts πολλοὺς before ἀποθνήσκοντας; but if πολλοὺς be omitted (cp. Critical Note), ἑαυτῶν must be taken in the second clause as a kind of partitive genitive, to which τινὰς must be supplied to agree with ἀποθνήσκοντας: cp. iv. 2. 20. The parallel sentence following with αὐτοὺς ... αὐτῶν makes it more probable that some word like πολλοὺς has fallen out.

<lemma>πάλιν</lemma>. The reference is probably general, i.e. to the part played by Corinth at the time of the Peloponnesian War, and not to the division of opinion just after the battle of Corinth, when some wished to treat with the Lacedaemonians: cp. iv. 2. 23; Dem. xx. 52.</p>

<lemma>οὕτως ἀπλῶς</lemma>, ‘in so straightforward a manner.’
        
        §§ 9-11. The difficulties in understanding the fight between the Long Walls of Corinth are due to Xenophon’s carelessness of writing, or, it may be, to lacunae in the text. He has omitted to state whether the Lacedaemonians drew up in front or behind their stockade. He says nothing as to how the Corinthians from the city, who were posted opposite the Lacedaemonians, fared at their hands. He leaves us to infer that the mercenaries of Iphicrates after their defeat by the Corinthian exiles made good their escape within the city walls. He does not state whether the ladders, whereby the Argives, hemmed in by the Lacedaemonians on one side and the Corinthian exiles on the other, attempted to escape, were laid against the Eastern Long Wall or the city Wall. Finally he does not explain how so many of the Boeotian garrison at Lechaeum came to be killed.
</p><p>
        The solution of all these difficulties is hardly possible, and in any case must involve several assumptions. The Long Walls, it is to be remembered, ran North and South, being about one mile and a quarter in length, and there being a considerable distance between them. To strengthen their position, the Lacedaemonians had hastily built up a stockade with a trench in front, i.e. facing south,

        <pb n="137"/>

        and it is therefore to be assumed that on the day of battle, when owing to the reinforcements received by the enemy the odds were still greater against them than at first, they posted themselves behind the stockade, with their front towards Corinth, the Lacedaemonians themselves being on the right, the Sicyonians in the centre, and the Corinthian exiles by the Eastern Wall on the left, Pasimelus and his handful of horse being probably in the rear on the right. The enemy took up their position opposite, the Corinthians on the West, opposite the Lacedaemonians, the Argives in the centre, and Iphicrates and his mercenaries on the East. At the first onset the Argives easily overwhelmed the Sicyonians, broke through the stockade and pursued their opponents down to the sea. At the same time, the Corinthian exiles repelled the attack of Iphicrates, and coming out of the stockade (at least so it is to be supposed) pursued him and his mercenaries almost up to the walls of Corinth. The Lacedaemonians meanwhile, we must assume, these Corinthians not being mentioned again after § 9, had easily defeated the Corinthians opposed to them, but had not gone outside the stockade to pursue them. They preferred to wait for the Argives; and accordingly before their return left the stockade (ἐξελθόντες), which was broken in the centre, and formed anew just outside it with their front facing East ἐν ἀριστερᾷ ἔχοντες τὸ σταύρωμα. The Argives, having overcome the opposition of Pasimelus and his dismounted horsemen, hastened back southwards ἐκ τοῦ σταυρώματος, and thus exposed their unshielded side to the Lacedaemonians stationed on their flank. Naturally they swerved in the opposite direction, i.e. eastwards under the Long Wall, and thus met the Corinthian exiles returning from the pursuit of Iphicrates’ mercenaries. Their position was now, as Xenophon describes, hopeless, their only means of escape being the ladders leading to the top of the Long Wall (for the battle took place, it is to be remembered, inside the walls). Those who were fortunate enough to climb on to the wall were no better off than those in the mêlée below; for they perished in the attempt to jump down the other side.
</p><p>
Diodorus (xiv. 86) gives a totally different account of the attack of the Corinthian exiles and their Lacedaemonian allies, which cannot in any particular be reconciled with Xenophon’s <pb n="138"/> narrative. Its result, he says, was the capture of Lechaeum and the docks.

<lemma>κρατούμενα τὰ κατὰ τοὺς Σικυωνίους</lemma>. The correctness of this reading, although it involves the interpretation of κατά in quite a different sense from what it bears two lines above, seems to be proved by the following βοηθοῦντες; this word is otiose, if Breitenbach’s conjecture κρατοῦντα be adopted, although he is thereby enabled to translate κατά, ‘opposite to,’ ‘over against.’ Reading κρατούμενα, we must translate τὰ κατὰ κ.τ.λ. ‘the part of the army near the Sicyonians’: cp.

It is evident from the context that Xenophon must mean the ordinary ladders or steps leading to the top of the Eastern Long Wall, and not ladders let down by the citizens from the city wall to rescue the fugitives: else why should they have jumped down the other side and been killed thereby? Such headlong haste is only explicable, supposing τοῦ τείχους to mean the Long Wall.

<p>
<lemma>οἱ ἐν τῷ λιμένι ... φύλακες</lemma>. Andocides (iii. 18-20) says that the result of this victory was the capture of Lechaeum, and Diodorus also in his confused version of these events (xiv. 86) speaks of the capture of both τὸ Λεχαίον καὶ τὸν ναύσταθμον. Xenophon himself in this same chapter § 17 represents the Lacedaemonians ἐκ τοῦ Λεχαίου ὁρμώμενοι συν μόρᾳ καὶ τοῖς τῶν Κορινθίων φεύγασι, although he does not relate the capture of τὰ νεώρια till § 19. Again in iv. 8. 10, when he is bringing up the naval events of the war to the same date, he speaks of the Corinthians as masters ἐν τῷ περί Ἀχαίαν καὶ Λεχαίου κόλπῳ, until Teleutias appeared upon the scene. We must assume (cp. Introd. p. xlix) that it was Teleutias’ capture of τὰ νεώρια that made the Lacedaemonians once more masters of the Gulf. There are two ways of reconciling these conflicting statements. Either we may suppose that after the victory of Praxitas the Lacedaemonians occupied Lechaeum
        <pb n="140"/>
        (into the heart of which they certainly penetrated even according to Xenophon’s story) συν μόρᾳ καὶ τοῖς τῶν Κορινθίων φεύγασι, but were subsequently expelled in some manner unrecorded; for they cannot have been in Lechaeum, whilst the Athenians were repairing the Long Walls § 18, or before Teleutias captured τὰ νεώρια § 19. Or we may suppose that Diodorus and Andocides are wrong, and that Praxitas withdrew the whole of his forces after his victory both from the Long Walls and from Lechaeum. This second hypothesis necessitates the supposition that Xenophon has related (§ 18) the sally of the Lacedaemonians ἐκ τοῦ Λεχαίου out of its chronological order, and grouped it with his story about the Mantineans on account of the close connexion of subject; but that the event really occurred after Teleutias’ capture of τὰ νεώρια § 19. Parallel cases for such grouping can be found in vii. chaps. 2, 3 and 4, and this permanent Lacedaemonian garrison of Lechaeum reappears iv. 5. 7, 11, 18. Xenophon’s narrative and the confusion of Diodorus at this point seem on the whole to favour the second hypothesis.
</p><p>
        Breitenbach’s theory that the Lacedaemonians retained their mastery over the town of Lechaeum, but lost the docks, seems to be negatived by geographical considerations. For it appears from Paus. ii. 2. 3 and Strab. viii. 551 that practically there was no town of Lechaeum apart from the docks.

The money to pay the mercenaries was doubtless furnished on the Lacedaemonian side by Agesilaus’ Asiatic booty, and on the Corinthian side by the Persian gold of Pharnabazus and Conon (cp. iv. 8. 8). The numbers of men willing to serve as mercenaries were continuously on the increase, not only because
        <pb n="141"/>

        the long wars had interrupted trade and commerce, but because the endless political revolutions were always followed by the exile of citizens, who were thus deprived of all other employment. Cp. iii. 1. 13 note.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15"><p>
<lemma>Ίφικράτης</lemma>. Demosthenes had been the first Athenian general to discover the value of light-armed troops in his Aetolian and Acarnanian campaigns of 426 (Thuc. iii. 94 sqq.), and Cleon brought him some peltasts among the light-armed troops as reinforcements for the attack upon the Lacedaemonians in Sphacteria (Thuc. iv. 28). Brasidas in his Thracian campaign had some peltasts in his army (Thuc. iv. 111). Their accoutrement seems to have been of Thracian origin (Her. vii. 75; Xen. Mem. iii. 9. 2; Aristoph. Achar. 159), consisting of javelins (ἀκόντια), targets or small shields (πέλται), and dirks (ἐγχειρίδια μικρά). Iphicrates increased their efficiency by lengthening the javelin by one half, doubling the length of the dirk, and perhaps in some way modifying the shape or size of the target (Diod. xv. 44; Corn. Nep. Iphic. 1). They were thus enabled to attack not only by throwing the javelin, but with the sword at close quarters, if necessary, and at the same time they could move with as much activity as the ψιλοί, who were armed only with missile weapons and carried no shield. The πέλτη, from which the name πελταστής was derived, seems thus to have been described by Aristotle (frag. 456)—εἶδος ἀσπίδος, ἥτις ἴτυν οὐκ ἔχει οὐδ' ἐστὶν ἐπίχαλκος οὐδὲ βοὸς ἀλλ' αἰγὸς δέρματι περιτεταμένη. Arrian (Tac. 3) concisely contrasts the peltasts with the hoplites and light-armed troops: τὸ πελταστικὸν δὲ κουφότερον μέν τυγχάνει ὂν τοῦ ὁπλιτικοῦ—ἡ γὰρ πέλτη μικροτέρα τῆς ἀσπίδος καὶ ἐλαφροτέρα, καὶ τὰ ἀκόντια τῶν δοράτων καὶ σαρισῶν λειπόμενα—βαρύτερον δὲ τοῦ ψιλοῦ.</p>

§§ 1-5. On an expedition to Piraeum Agesilaus surprised the Argives celebrating the Isthmian games. By a ruse he captured much booty and many prisoners in Piraeum. §§ 6-10. Puffed up with pride he refused to notice some Theban envoys, who had come to ask for peace: just at the moment news was brought him of the annihilation of the Spartan mora. The envoys said no more about peace. Next day Agesilaus marched up to the gates of Corinth and encamped round Lechaeum. §§ 11-17. This Spartan mora was returning to Lechaeum from escorting the Amyclaeans on their homeward march to take part in the Hyacinthia, when it was suddenly attacked by Iphicrates and his peltasts. The hoplites were no match in speed for the light-armed troops, and their resistance to the onset grew feebler until their discomfiture was completed by the arrival of Callias and the Athenian hoplites. Only a remnant escaped to Lechaeum. §§ 18-19. Agesilaus retired hastily to Sparta. Iphicrates further succeeded in capturing Sidus, Crommyon, and Oenoe: but the Lacedaemonians held Lechaeum.

On the next day, which was sacred to Apollo, the rites were more cheerful. The day began with a great procession in which all the Amyclaeans, a large portion of the Spartans, and many of the neighbouring population, took part. The procession was accompanied by a poem in anapaestic measures, and ended with the presentation to the god of the robe woven by the Spartan women. The remainder of the day was occupied with a sacrifice and feast and various kinds of amusements.

§§ 1-12. At the entreaty of the Achaeans, who wished to secure Calydon against the attacks of the Acarnanians and their allies, Agesilaus led an expedition into Acarnania. By a long march into the heart of the country he captured rich booty, but on his return extricated his army with great difficulty from the mountains, inflicting however considerable loss upon the Acarnanians. §§ 13-14. Discontented at these results the Achaeans entreated Agesilaus to stay longer in the country. Promising a second invasion he retired through Aetolia to Rhium and thence homewards.

        § 1. The threat of a second invasion speedily induced the Acarnanians to make peace with the Achaeans and to enter the Spartan League. §§ 2-7. Agesipolis headed a second invasion of the Argolis. Before entering the country he consulted the gods in Olympia and Delphi, whether he might     <pb n="151"/> lawfully refuse to acknowledge the Sacred Truce, which on similar occasions the Argives had fraudulently pleaded. Assured that he might, he entered the country and advanced to the very gates of Argos, doing great damage.

We may therefore infer that at the time of the Carnea and other such festivals (the plural τοὺς μῆνας shows that there were more than one) the various Dorian states felt themselves bound to respect the Holy Truce during their celebration, when it was duly proclaimed. The Argives apparently availed themselves of the chaos of the Greek Calendars, which were reckoned differently in different states, to proclaim such a truce, whenever it suited their convenience (cp. ὥσπερ εἰώθεσαν § 3), even when they did not resort to tricks still more disreputable, like that practised in 419, when they invaded the territory of Epidaurus only a few days before the Carnean festival.

        §§ 1-4. Meanwhile after their victory Pharnabazus and Conon expelled the Spartan harmosts from the islands and coast cities. At Ephesus Pharnabazus gave Conon 40 ships and bade him meet him at Sestos, because Dercylidas kept fast hold of Abydos. §§ 5-6. Dercylidas further secured Sestos, so that Pharnabazus found these two cities unassailable. The satrap left Conon in the Hellespont with orders to collect a large fleet for the next campaign. §§ 7-8. In the spring Pharnabazus and Conon crossed to Melos, ravaged the Spartan coasts, garrisoned Cythera, and supplied the allies at Corinth with money. §§ 9-11. Pharnabazus returned home, but allowed Conon to remain with the fleet to help the Athenians rebuild their Long Walls and the Wall of Piraeus. This was successfully accomplished. With the Persian gold the Corinthians fitted out a fleet, and it was not until the appointment of Teleutias that the Spartans could regain the mastery of the Corinthian Gulf. §§ 12-15. Alarmed at Conon’s successes the Spartans sent Antalcidas to Tiribazus, at the same time that the Athenians and their allies sent envoys to counteract his influence. The terms that he proposed to the Satrap were for various reasons rejected by all the other envoys. §§ 16-19. Tiribazus, having supplied Antalcidas with money and arrested Conon, went up to the Persian King. His place was taken by Struthas, who vigorously supported the Athenians. The Spartans despatched Thibron to make war upon him; but he soon contrived to surprise

        <pb n="154"/>
        and slay Thibron and to scatter his forces. §§ 20-22. Alarmed lest the Athenians should win over Rhodes, the Lacedaemonians at the entreaty of the Rhodian oligarchs sent out Ecdicus with 8 ships, and at the same time despatched Diphridas to replace Thibron. Diphridas was more successful against Struthas; but Ecdicus, finding the Rhodian democrats too strong, remained inactive at Cnidus. §§ 23-24. Teleutias was sent to supersede Ecdicus. On his way to Rhodes he captured an Athenian squadron sailing to the help of Evagoras in Cyprus. He brought back his spoils to Cnidus, and then proceeded to Rhodes. §§ 25-30. Hereupon the Athenians despatched Thrasybulus with 40 ships. First he persuaded Medocus, king of the Odrysae, and Seuthes to become allies of Athens. Then he sailed to Byzantium, sold the tolls, and set up a democracy. Next he made friends with the Chalcedonians. Arrived in Lesbos, where only the Mytilenaeans were friendly, he collected an army, attacked Methymna, defeated and slew the Spartan harmost, and raised a large sum of money, besides winning over some of the other cities. Before sailing for Rhodes he extorted money both from other cities and from Aspendus. In revenge the Aspendians slew him. §§ 31-39. The Athenians sent out Agyrrhius to replace Thrasybulus. The Ephors despatched Anaxibius to supersede Dercylidas at Abydos, where he did much damage to Athenian interests. The Athenians accordingly sent out Iphicrates and his peltasts to the Hellespont. Iphicrates surprised and slew Anaxibius as he was returning from Antandros.

Of the rest some similarly expelled the Lacedaemonian garrisons and asserted their independence, whilst others went further and actively supported Conon: so that the Lacedaemonians ἀπὸ τούτου τοῦ χρόνου τὴν κατὰ θάλατταν ἀρχὴν ἀπέβαλον.

<lemma>ἡ εἰρήνη . . . ἀτελῆς</lemma>. It would appear from Andocides’ speech De Pace that Sparta shortly afterwards—probably in the winter of 392-391—made another effort to bring about a general peace in Greece, this time without any appeal to Persia. Andocides, one of the Athenian envoys, strongly advocated the peace, the terms of which were according to him peculiarly favourable to Athens. Notwithstanding a general clause to make τάς πόλεις αὐτονόμους, the Athenians were to retain possession of Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros and to keep their newly built Long Walls and triremes without interference. The Boeotians were to recognize the independence of Orchomenos and the Argives to give up their hold upon Corinth. Andocides represents the Lacedaemonians and Boeotians as eager for the peace, the Argives and Corinthians as opposed to it. The historian Philochorus (fr. ap. Andoc. de Pace 108.) stated that the Lacedaemonian envoys ἄπρακτους ἀνελθεῖν μή πείσαντος τοῦ Άνδοκίδου: cp. iv. 5. 6 note.

<lemma>Ῥοδίων</lemma>. Xenophon has made no previous mention of Rhodian affairs, and the antecedent events can only imperfectly be put together out of Diod. xiv. 79, 97. The revolt of the island from Sparta and the admission of Conon to the harbour (cp. iii. 4. 28 note) in 395 implied, it would seem, the supremacy of the democratic party. But in 391 the oligarchs rose against the democrats, expelled them from the city, and defeated them in a pitched battle. Then further to secure their position they sent envoys to Sparta περὶ βοηθείας, εὐλαβούμενοι μή τινες τῶν πολιτῶν νεωτερίσωσι.

        <pb n="160"/>

        This story of Diodorus explains the small number of the ships which the Spartans sent to aid the Rhodian oligarchs, but it is inconsistent with Xenophon’s οἱ έκπεπληγότες Ῥοδίων ὑπὸ τοῦ δήμου and with § 25 τοὺς φίλους τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τείχος ἔχοντας (where τείχος can only mean a fort, not the acropolis, as Breitenbach suggests, of Rhodes) and τοὺς ἑτέρους (Athenian) φίλους . . . τάς τε πόλεις ἔχοντας καὶ πολλὸ πλείους ὄντας καὶ μάχην κεκρατηκότας.

Not content with the kingship of Salamis, he had attempted to win supremacy over the other states of Cyprus, three of which—Amathus, Soli, and Citium—appealed to Persia for aid. The king charged the Carian prince Hecatomnus and the Lydian satrap Autophradates with the task of checking his ambitious schemes. Evagoras thus finding himself involved in a war with Persia sought help from the Athenians, who out of gratitude and forgetful of their own need of Persian support against Sparta, first despatched this squadron of ten triremes under Philocrates and, again in 388 a second squadron under Chabrias: v. 1. 10; cp.

Demosthenes (xxiv. 134) states that he was imprisoned for many years for embezzling the public money, but does not specify the occasion. He restored the θεωρικά and was the first to introduce payment of one obol for attendance at the Ecclesia—probably after Conon’s arrival at Athens—and this he further increased to three obols (Arist. Ἀθ. πολ. 41 and Aristoph. Eccles. 183-300, exhibited c. 391). Hereby he seems to have gained great influence (cp. Aristoph. Plut. 176, exhibited 389-8), was elected στρατηγός and sent out to succeed Thrasybulus: Plat. Com. fr. 185.

        §§ 1-5. In revenge for acts of piracy encouraged by the Spartans, the Athenians blockaded the Aeginetans and fortified a post upon the island. Teleutias raised the blockade. Hierax, his successor, sailed to Rhodes leaving his secretary Gorgopas at Aegina, who forced the Athenians to abandon their post. The Aeginetans then renewed their depredations. §§ 6-9. Antalcidas sailed to Ephesus to replace Hierax, and sent his secretary Nicolochus to the Hellespont. Gorgopas surprised an Athenian squadron off the Attic coast, capturing 4 ships. §§ 10-12. Chabrias on his way to Cyprus to help Evagoras defeated and slew Gorgopas, whereupon the Aeginetans stopped their depredations. §§ 13-24. Teleutias was reappointed admiral, much to the joy of the Peloponnesian sailors at Aegina. He made a sudden descent on Piraeus, and with the rich booty taken thence, and the capture of many cornships and merchantmen amply provided for his sailors. §§ 25-28. Antalcidas came down with Tiribazus, bringing terms of peace from the king. He went to Abydos to relieve Nicolochus, who was blockaded there by the Athenians, surprised an Athenian squadron, and being joined by Syracusan and Italian ships gained full command over the sea. §§ 29-31. The Greek states, all for various reasons eager for peace, gladly obeyed the summons of Tiribazus to listen to the terms dictated by the king, viz. that the Greek states in Asia should belong to Persia, and that the Greek states in Europe should all be autonomous, except the Athenian possessions, Lemnos, Imbros, and Scyros. §§ 32-36. All the states agreed to the terms except the Thebans; but on the threat of an invasion they submitted. Agesilaus also compelled the Corinthians to dismiss their Argive garrison. All armed forces were disbanded. Sparta reaped great advantages as champion of the King’s Peace.</p>

        § 25. ὁ δὲ Ἀνταλκίδας: cp. § 6. According to Plutarch (Artax. 21, 22) Antalcidas had succeeded in personally ingratiating himself with Artaxerxes, notwithstanding that monarch’s great dislike to the Spartans in general as ἀνθρώπων ἀπάντων ἀναιδεστάτους (cp. iv. 8. 17). It was, moreover, obviously to the interest of Persia to make peace at this moment. For not only had the Athenians recovered their Hellespontine province and some of the islands (cp. Appendix, p. 355), but they had actively supported Evagoras in his revolt against the Great King (iv. 8. 24; v. 1. 10). Evagoras had just reached the highest point of his success, having subjugated almost the whole of Cyprus, captured Tyre, ravaged Phoenicia, and raised a rebellion in Cilicia. He had too made alliances with and received reinforcements from Acoris, king of Egypt, Hecatomnus, a Carian chieftain, the king of the Arabians, and other rebellious princes, so that it was necessary for Artaxerxes to collect the whole force of the Empire against him: cp. Isocr. ix. 62; Diod. xiv. 110; xv. 2; Justin. vi. 6. 2.</p>

Again in 398-7 they had supplied him with mercenary soldiers to use against Carthage (Diod. xiv. 44); and two years later the Lacedaemonian Pharacidas, the commander of 30 ships from his allies in Italy and Peloponnesus, had saved the tyrant, when

To strengthen their position, the remaining citizens entered into a treaty with Athens, wherein they agreed to pay ἡ ἐπὶ θράσων βούλου εἰκοστῇ, on condition that the Athenians did not interfere with their internal affairs or occupy their city with a garrison against their will (CIA. ii. 14, 14 b). The date of the inscription is the archonship of Theodotus, 387-6, which proves that Antalcidas cannot have become master of the sea before July, 387. Cp. Swoboda, Mitth. d. deutsch. arch.

<lemma>ὑπὲρ πάντων Βοιωτῶν</lemma>: cp. Appendix, p. 357. It had always been the Theban ambition to form a συνοικισμός of all the Boeotian states similar to that attributed to Theseus in Attica; but the scheme had never been successful. Plataea, supported by Athens, had always and obstinately maintained her independence: cp. Her. vi. 108; Thuc. ii. 2; esp. iii. 6 ἡμεῖς (the Thebans) δὲ αὐτοῖς (the Plataeans) διάφοροι ἐγενόμεθα πρῶτον ὅτι ἡμῶν κτισαντων Πλάταιαν ὕστερον τῆς ἄλλης Βοιωτίας καὶ ἄλλα χωρία μετ᾽ αὐτῆς, ὁ ἡμύκτιτους ἀνθρώπους ἐξελάσαντες ἔχομεν, οὐκ ἡμῶν οὔτοι, ὥσπερ ἐτάχθην τὸ πρῶτον, ἠγεμόνας ὑφ᾽ ἡμῶν, ἔξω δὲ τῶν ἄλλων Βοιωτῶν, παραβαίνοντες τὰ πάτρια, ἐπειδὴ προστιμάχοιτο, προσεχώρησαν πρὸς Ἀθηναίους. Similarly the jealousy of her powerful rival Orchomenus had always hampered Thebes in Eastern Boeotia; cp. iii. 5. 6 note. The Thebans now wished to swear as if Thebes were ἠγεμών οἱ ξύμμαχοι ὑπήκοοι, whereas Sparta, although ἠγεμών of the Peloponnesian confederacy, always professedly recognized the liberty and autonomy of her allies (cp. Thuc. v. 79 ται ... πόλεις ται ἐν Πελοποννάσω κοινωνούτων τῶν σπονδῶν καὶ τῶν ξυμμαχίων αὐτονόμων καὶ αὐτοπόλεις, κ.τ.λ.), and seriously consulted them on questions of peace or war: cp. ii. 2. 19 ff.; iii. 4. 2; v. 2. 11, 20, 37 κατὰ τὸ δόγμα τῶν συμμάχων.
        
        ὁ δὲ Ἀγησίλαος. Notwithstanding that the peace proposals had emanated from his political opponent Antalcidas, and that by his own efforts to liberate the Greeks of Asia Minor were deliberately abandoned, Agesilaus saw in the Peace an instrument whereby to humiliate the Thebans, the real cause of Sparta’s troubles in Greece and of his own recall from Asia, and accordingly

The lives of the democratical leaders were spared at Pausanias’ intercession. Under the new aristocracy the Mantineans were more happy than heretofore. §§ 8-10. Next the

        Phliasian exiles asked the Spartans to procure their recall. This was accordingly effected, with the understanding that their goods should be restored to them. §§ 11-19. Envoys from Acanthus and Apollonia came to Sparta to seek help against the growing Olynthian Confederacy which threatened their independence. The Acanthian Cleigenes addressed the Spartan assembly and allies. §§ 20-24. The Spartans and their allies voted to send an army of 10,000 men against Olynthus, but on the urgent representations of the envoys consented to despatch at once a small preliminary force. Eudamidas accordingly with 2,000 men hurried off to Thrace. §§ 25-31. Afterwards his brother Phoebidas set out with the rest of Eudamidas' troops. While he was encamped at Thebes, the Boeotarch Leontiades offered to betray the Cadmea. Phoebidas was accordingly introduced into the citadel during the Thesmophoria: whereon Leontiades announced the fact to the Council, arrested his colleague Ismenias, and on the flight of 300 of his opponents to Athens repaired to Sparta. §§ 32-36. Many at Sparta were opposed to Phoebidas' action, but Agesilaus maintained that the real question at issue was its utility. Leontiades then enlarged upon its advantages. The Spartans resolved to retain the Cadmea, and bring Ismenias to trial. He was condemned for Medism and put to death. §§ 37-43. The Spartans now pressed forward their Olynthian expedition. Teleutias, being appointed harmost, marched slowly forwards, collecting forces from every quarter (the Thebans being specially zealous), as far as Potidaea. He ended the campaign with an indecisive victory at the gates of Olynthus.</p>

Afterwards a συνοικισμός took place at a date which cannot be determined, but which Bursian (Geogr. ii. 209) conjectures to have been just after the Persian wars, when at the instigation of the Argives the Mantineans built them- selves a city on the banks of the Ophis just to the south of the πτόλις: Strab. viii. 337; Paus. viii. 8. 7; 12. 7.</p>

But whether the motive was merely to avoid a thankless task, or to excite odium against his colleague Agesipolis, is a matter of mere conjecture.

At the present day the river Ophis is at a considerable distance from the ruins of Mantinea, as it was rebuilt in 370 B.C. (vi. 5. 5). The ancient authorities can be reconciled by supposing that in 385 the Ophis actually did flow through the city, but that the authority of Plutarch and Pausanias was only acquainted with Mantinea as it stood subsequently to 370 B.C., and hence made his account of the stratagem square with the then existing state of things.

The pre-eminence of Olynthus, situated at the bottom of the Toronaean Gulf a little distance from the sea, had in the first instance been due to a συνοικισμός of the coast towns brought about by Perdiccas, king of Macedon, at the time of the revolt of Potidaea from the Athenian Confederacy 432 B.C. The Olynthians revolted at the same time, and never again acknowledged the supremacy of Athens (Thuc. i. 58; v. 18, 39). Shortly after the Peloponnesian war the Olynthians and some of the neighbouring Greek states formed a confederacy known as τὸ κοινὸν τῶν Χαλκιδέων, wherein 
<pb n="182"/>

<lemma>τὰς τῆς Μακεδονίας πόλεις </lemma>... ἀπὸ ᾿Αμύντου. Amyntas, the son of Perdiccas’ brother Arrhidaeus, had seized the Macedonian throne about 390 B.C. In order to maintain his position he had shortly afterwards entered into a defensive alliance with the Chalcidian League, whereby certain commercial advantages were to be secured by the contracting parties (Hicks, Insc. 74). Notwithstanding this alliance he was in 385 expelled by the Illyrians, who placed the pretender Argaeus upon the throne. Thereupon the Chalcidians took advantage of the confusion to secure—really for themselves, though nominally in the name of their ally Amyntas—τὰς τῆς Μακεδονίας πόλεις: and when two years later in 383 Amyntas was suddenly restored to his throne by the Thessalians, they refused to give up these towns, which had meanwhile entered their Confederacy.

        Diodorus (xiv. 84, 89, 92; xv. 19) follows a different and in many respects inconsistent tradition. The author of a recently discovered letter to ? Alexander the Great (Oxyrhynchus Papyri, i. 13) makes the exaggerated statement Θηβαῖοι γὰρ πρῶτοι μὲν ᾿Αμύνταν τὸν πατέρα τοῦ Φιλίππου μετ᾿ ᾿Ολυνθίων ἐπεχείρησαν ἐκβαλεῖν μὲν ἐκ τῆς χώρας, ἀποστερῆσαι δὲ τῆς βασιλείας: it is plain from Xenophon (§§ 13-38) that the proposed alliance between the Olynthians and Thebans, if ever formally concluded, was never really effective.

<lemma>ὲν αποροίτοις ; cp</lemma>. Oxyrh. Pap. i. 13 and § 12 note), or whether he yielded merely to the temptations of Leontiades, must of necessity remain an open question. Some commentators have urged against Xenophon's view of the circumstances, that the mere presence of Phoebidas at Thebes at all, which is out of the direct line of march towards Olynthus, is a sufficient evidence of the preconcerted nature of the affair: but Thebes is so short a distance out of the direct line, that the advantage of Phoebidas' appearing in person to receive the Theban contingent, evidently expected for the Olynthian campaign, is quite a sufficient motive to explain his détour. It is curious, however, that Xenophon should wholly have omitted the story of his punishment with a fine of 100,000 drachmae, which is too well attested by Plutarch (Pel. 6; Ages. 24), Diodorus (1. c.), and Nepos (Pel. 1) to admit of doubt.

The Ephors declared war upon the other Phliasians, and despatched Agesilaus against them. He met all their overtures for peace with the demand that they should surrender the citadel. On their refusal he laid siege to the city. §§ 18-20. After some small operations in Olynthian territory and the capture of Torone, Agesipolis died of fever, much to the grief of Agesilaus. He was replaced by Polybiades. §§ 21-25. After a prolonged siege the Phliasians at last applied to Agesilaus for leave to send envoys to Sparta to arrange terms. Highly indignant he persuaded the Ephors to leave the matter to him: he set up a provisional government to draw up a constitution, and after leaving a garrison in the city disbanded his army. § 26. Polybiades starved the Olynthians into coming to terms: they agreed to enter the Spartan Confederacy. § 27. Thus everywhere Sparta seemed to be stronger than ever.

<p>
        
        § 1. Xenophon’s comment on the story of Sparta’s downfall. §§ 2-9. The scribe Phillidas conspired with the fugitive Melon at Athens to put down the Theban despots. Melon thereupon with six comrades entered Boeotia by night, passed the day in a deserted spot, and the next night and day in Charon’s house in Thebes. By a stratagem they succeeded in killing the polemarchs; then they slew Leontiades. Next they released the prisoners from the gaol, armed them, proclaimed that Thebes was free, and sent the news to two Athenian generals on the frontier. §§ 10-12. The Spartan harmost in the Cadmea sent to Plataea and Thespiae for help, but in vain. He then agreed to evacuate the citadel on the promise of safety. The Thebans however cruelly massacred many of their political opponents. §§ 13-18. The Spartans put their harmost to death and declared war against Thebes. Agesilaus declining to serve, the Ephors sent Cleombrotus at the head of the expedition. After a few desultory operations in Boeotia, he returned home, leaving Sphodrias with a garrison in Thespiae. § 19. The Athenians in alarm put to death their two generals, who had been privy to Melon’s conspiracy. §§ 20-24. Sphodrias, persuaded by the Thebans, attempted to surprise Piraeus, but being overtaken by daylight at Thriae turned to Thespiae, committing sundry depredations on his march. The Athenians thereon arrested three Spartan envoys, who were in the city, but on their protesting their ignorance of the plan soon released them. Sphodrias was brought to trial for the outrage, but was acquitted. §§ 25-33. The real reason of Sphodrias’ acquittal was the friendship of his son Cleonymus with Archidamus the son of Agesilaus: for Archidamus interceded with his father for his life. §§ 34-41. The Athenians strengthened Piraeus, built ships, and supported the Boeotians. The Spartans again collected an army against Thebes. Agesilaus, being overpersuaded to lead the expedition, having first secured Cithaeron, took up his quarters at Thespiae, and ravaged Boeotia with varying success. At last he fortified Thespiae, left Phoebidas as harmost, and returned home. §§ 42-46. After many skirmishes Phoebidas was slain and his troops routed. The Thebans regained their courage and attacked the neighbouring cities. The Laccadaemonians sent a polemarch with a mora by sea to guard Thespiae. §§ 47-55. In the spring Agesilaus once more led an expedition against Thebes: though on one occasion he penetrated nearly to Thebes, no decisive action was fought. At the end of the campaign after ending a dissension at Thespiae, he retired homewards. §§ 56-57. Hard pressed by these two invasions the Thebans bought corn
        
        <pb n="195"/>


from Pagasae, which on its way fell into the hands of the Spartan commandant at Oreus. The crews of the cornships, being left unguarded, induced the city to revolt from Sparta, and so the Thebans recovered their corn. §§ 58-61. Next spring the Lacedaemonians once more assembled an army against Thebes. Agesilaus being ill, Cleombrotus commanded the expedition, but being unable to cross Cithaeron, which was guarded by the Thebans and Athenians, he at once disbanded his army. Their allies being discontented at the length of the war and the growing power of Athens at sea, the Spartans manned a fleet of 60 triremes with their admiral Pollis at its head. Pollis cut off the Athenian corn supply, but was soon defeated by Chabrias. §§ 62-66. At the request of the Thebans, the Athenians sent Timotheus with 60 ships round the Peloponnesus. The Thebans, being thus left at peace, recovered many of their neighbouring cities. Timotheus won Corcyra over to the Athenian side, and defeated the Spartan admiral Nicolochus at Alyzia. Being further reinforced he became complete master of the sea, yet was obliged to send to Athens for money.</p>

<lemma>ἐγράψατε</lemma>: cp. Plut. Pel. 7 Φιλλίδας δὲ διεπράξατο τῶν περὶ Ἀρχίαν καὶ Φίλιππον γραμματεύς γενέσθαι πολεμάρχωντων.

        <pb n="196"/>


τοῖς περὶ Ἀρχίαν πολεμάρχοις: cp. Plut. Daem. Socr. 377 τοῖς περὶ τὸν Ἀρχίαν πολεμάρχουσι. It is curious that in v. 2. 25 Xenophon should mention only two polemarchs and that Plutarch on this occasion should speak only of Archias and Philip as polemarchs, and yet that both authors should use the phrase οἱ περὶ Ἀρχίαν πολέμαρχοι, which in classical Greek cannot be used of less than three persons. It is tempting therefore to suppose that in Thebes, as in most Boeotian towns, there were three polemarchs (cp. v. 2. 25 note), and that Xenophon has, from some reason or other—perhaps from ignorance—omitted to name the third. In support of this hypothesis it may be remarked that he does not even call Philip one of the polemarchs (την περὶ Φίλιππον τυραννίδα), although Plutarch throughout so styles him; that in §§ 5-6 he speaks of three of the conspirators dressed up ὡς δεσποῖνας and of their sitting παρ' ἑκάστῳ (i.e. of the polemarchs?); and that in vii. 3. 7 he speaks of the assassination of οἱ περὶ Ἀρχίαν καὶ Ὑπάτην, although here he never names Hypates, and it is only from Plutarch that we learn the manner of his death. Plutarch moreover is not consistent: in the Life of Pelopidas and the Daemonioum Socratis he calls only Archias and Philip polemarchs, but in the Life of Agesilaus 24, he says, τὸν Ἀρχίαν καὶ τὸν Λεοντίδαν ἀπεκτόνεσαν ... πολεμάρχους ὄντας, although it seems to follow from Xenophon’s narrative (especially § 7 παρά τῶν πολεμάρχων), as indeed from his own, that Leontiades was not polemarch at the time. On the whole, therefore, it seems easier to suppose that there were three polemarchs than that Xenophon has used the phrase οἱ περὶ Ἀρχίαν πολέμαρχοι of only two persons. Cp. Appendix, p. 358.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἀφηγημέψο Ἀθήναζε</lemma>. Plutarch knows nothing of Phillidas' visit to Athens.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Μελῶν</lemma>. It has been objected against Xenophon that he says nothing of the part played by Pelopidas in the liberation of Thebes. It is remarkable, however, that though in his Life of Pelopidas Plutarch (cp. Corn. Nep. Pel. 2 dux erat Pelopidas) represents the leading part as taken by that hero, yet in his Dem. Socr. Melon occupies the more prominent place.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τῶν Ἀθηναῖς πεφευγότων</lemma>. Plutarch (Pel. 6) relates that the Lacedaemonians had formally demanded the expulsion of these exiles, but that the Athenians in gratitude for the kindness shown

by the Thebans to Thrasybulus and their democratical exiles in 404-403 (cp. ii. 4. 1) had refused to comply; whereupon the Theban oligarchs had secretly plotted against the exiles and had procured the assassination of Androclides, one of their leaders (cp. iii. 5. 1, 4; v. 2. 31, 35).</p>

<p>
<lemma>τὰ περὶ </lemma>... τήν περὶ ... τυραννίδα. This strangely-worded distinction between Archias and Philip seems to show that Xenophon did not regard Philip as holding office at the time. The repetition of the article and irregular sequence of καί after -πε seems to denote that the different action of the two men in their respective spheres combined to produce one tyranny. In both Xenophon and Plutarch, Archias appears as the chief figure among the Theban oligarchs, and next to him Leontiades: cp. §§ 6-19; Plut. Pel. 10, 11; Daem. Socr. 576, 577, 596, 597; Critical Note and Appendix, p. 360.</p>

<p>
<lemma>αὐτοῦ = ἤ αὐτοῦ</lemma>.
§ 3. ἕξ. According to Plutarch twelve in all: cp. Pel. 8 ‘ὑφίσταται δὲ τὴν πρᾶξιν Πελοπίδας πρῶτος, εἶτα Μέλων καὶ Δαμοκλείδας καὶ Θεόπομπος, ἄνδρες οἴκου τε πρώτου καὶ πρὸς ἀλλήλους τὰ ἄλλα μὲν φιλικούς καὶ πιστούς, ὑπὲρ δὲ δόξης καὶ ἀνδρείας ἀεὶ φιλονεικος ἔχοντες. γενομένοι δὲ οἱ σύμπαντες δώδεκα, κ.τ.λ.: cp. Daem. Socr. 576.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τὴν χώραν</lemma>, Boeotia: Plutarch (Pel. 8) speaks of a considerable body of exiles under the command of Pherenicus waiting on the frontier ἐν τῷ Θρασίνῳ, whilst the twelve conspirators headed by Pelopidas made their way into Thebes. In the Daem. Socr. 576, 594 he is less exact, and speaks only of the twelve crossing Cithaeron in the guise of huntsmen.</p>

<p>
<lemma>πρός τὰς πύλας</lemma>. Plut. Pel. 9 διελθόντες αὐτοὺς ἄλλοι κατ' ἄλλα μέρη τῆς πόλεως παρεισῆλθον: cp. Daem. Socr. 594.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ὡς δή ἐξ ἀγροῦ</lemma>. Plut. Pel. 9 ἐδόθησαν γεωργῶν μεταλαβόντες, whereas in ch. 8 he had spoken of their being disguised as huntsmen: cp. Daem. Socr. 576 μετὰ κυρῶν περὶ τὸν Κιθαιρῶνα θηρεύσαι. Nepos (Pel. 2) combines the two versions: cum canibus venaticis exierunt, retia ferentes, vestitu agresti, quo minore suspicione facerent iter.</p>

        conceived the scheme of attack upon the polemarchs, and sent notice of it to his friends at Thebes, Charon, ὥσπερ ἦν ἐπιφανέστατος, agreed to offer his house: but in Daem. Socr. 576 Charon only offers his house on the receipt of a message from Pherenicus that the twelve youths had already started. On their arrival their friends met them at the several gates—so Plutarch says in both narratives—and conducted them to the house of Charon, where ἐγένοντο συν τοῖς φυγάσι πεντήκοντα δύο δέοντες (Pel. 9).</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἐπεμελεῖτο</lemma>. According to Plutarch (Daem. Socr. 577) the conspirators, to whom Phillidas was a party, had previously agreed upon a day and Phillidas arranged his feast to suit them: οὐκοῦν, εἶπεν (ὁ Φιλλίδας), ὀρθῶς ἐγὼ τὴν ὑποδοχὴν παρασκευάκα σήμερον, ὡς δέδεμενος Ἀρχίαν, καὶ παρέξομαι ἐν οἴνῳ καὶ μέθῃ τοῖς ἀνδράσι εὐχειρώτους. Rather inconsistently, Plutarch adds that an additional motive for haste was the fear lest the polemarchs should give orders for the immediate execution of Amphitheus, a democratical leader then in prison: cp. l. c. 594.</p>

<lemma>ταχύ ἐμεθύσθησαν</lemma>. According to Plutarch a warning reached Archias and his boon companions—οὔπω πάνυ πρόρρω μέθης οὖσιν—whereupon he summoned Charon to his presence. On his arrival Archias and Philip went to the door to meet him, but he and Phillidas contrived to disarm them of their suspicions. Again, a letter from Archias the Athenian hierophant, giving all the details of the conspiracy, was put into the hands of the polemarch, but he thrust it away under his pillow, exclaiming οὐκοῦν εἰς αὔριον τὰ σπουδαῖα: cp. Pel. 10; Daem. Socr. 594-596.</p>

<lemma>ὡς κομαστάς </lemma>... ἀποκτεῖναι. Plutarch rather combines the two stories. Pel. 11 Χάρων δὲ καὶ Μέλων ἐπὶ τὸν Ἀρχίαν καὶ Φίλιππον, ἐδόθησαν ἐπεσδυόμενοι γυναικείας τοῖς θώραξι, καὶ δασεῖς στεφάνους ἔχοντες τε καὶ πήκης περιειλέμενοι κατασκιάζοντας τὰ πρόσωπα. Daem. Socr. 596 Χάρων δὲ καὶ Μέλων ... ἠμφιάσκα ἐνδεδυμένοι καὶ στεφάνους δασεῖς ἔχοντες, οἱ μὲν ἑλάτης, οἱ δὲ πήκης, εἴσιο δὲ καὶ χιτῶμα τῶν γυναικῶν ἀμπεχόμενοι, μεθόντας ἀπιμοιούμενοι κόμῳ χωρίμενοι μετὰ γυναικῶν. In the Daem. Socr. Plutarch describes the fight between the polemarchs and the conspirators at some length. First Melon slays Archias, then Charon wounds Philip, who is despatched by Lysitheus. Theopompus kills Cabirichus, the sacred archon. A few of the servants are also slain, the rest are locked up within the house.</p>

<p>
<lemma>λαβὼν </lemma>... τρεῖς. Plutarch represents the conspirators as dividing themselves into two bodies, of which the one headed by Charon and Melon attacked the polemarchs, the other led by Pelopidas and Damocleidas—ἐν ἱματίοις ... ἔχοντες οὐδὲν ἕτερον τῶν ὅπλων ἤ μάχαιραν ἕκαστος—made at the same time for the house of Leontiades; with this second party Phillidas had nothing to do.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τοὺ μέν ἀποκτείναντες</lemma>. Plutarch (Pel. 11; Daem. Socr. 597) describes a long hand-to-hand fight between Leontiades and the conspirators. Leontiades cuts down Cephisodorus, who first entered the room, and is at last overcome in single combat by Pelopidas.</p>

Plutarch (Pel. 12) adds that the conspirators sent a messenger to summon the main body of exiles assembled on the Attic frontier (cp. § 3 note), and that ἤκου βοηθοῦντες αὐτοῖς μετὰ τῶν ὅπλων οἱ περὶ Ἐπαμεινώνδαν καὶ Γοργίαν, συνελθόντες οὐκ ὀλίγους τῶν νέων καὶ τῶν προεστώτων τοὺς βελτίστους (Epaminondas, according to the Daem. Socr. 576, had refused to take any part in the conspiracy from reluctance against shedding citizen blood, but was ready to join the conspirators afterwards, should they be successful). Plutarch goes on to say ἁμα δὲ ἡμέρα παρήσα μὲν ἐκ τῆς Ἀττικῆς οἱ φυγάδες ὁπλισμένοι, συνήθροιστο δὲ εἰς τὴν ἐκκλησίαν ὁ δῆμος. εἰσῆγον δὲ τοὺς περὶ Πελοπίδαν Ἐπαμεινώνδας καὶ Γοργίας ὑπὸ τῶν ἱερέων περιεχομένους στέμματα προεισιόντων καὶ παρακαλοῦντων τοὺς πολίτας τῇ πατρίδι καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς βοηθεῖν, ἤ δ’ ἐκκλησία ὀρθὴ πρὸς τὴν

Melon, Charon, and Pelopidas were then chosen Boeotarchs—thereby showing that the Boeotian League was once more to be called into existence, as presumably there had been no Boeotarchs elected since the Peace of Antalcidas.</p>

<p>
<lemma>δύο τῶν στρατηγῶν </lemma>... ἀπεστάληκεν. Undoubtedly there is here a lacuna of unknown dimensions, in which Xenophon probably explained how these two Athenian generals came to be on the frontier. Even as it stands, from Xenophon’s narrative it is evident that these two generals were privy to Melon’s plot (§ 19), that they acted on their own responsibility in giving assistance to the conspirators, and that they were afterwards condemned by the Athenians to avoid all appearance of a breach of the peace between themselves and the Lacedaemonians (cp. § 20). Diodorus (xv. 25, 26) gives an utterly inconsistent narrative, which is demonstrably false: the conspirators, he says, sent envoys to Athens to remind the Athenians of their past indebtedness to Thebes at the time of the Thirty, and to ask their assistance πανδημεί. The Athenian Assembly therefore voted, and immediately despatched the general Demophon at the head of 5,000 hoplites and 500 cavalry, preparing at the same time πανδημεί στρατεύειν εἰς τὴν Βοιωτίαν. But a little further on (c. 29) Diodorus, dealing with the events of the following year, states: τοῖς δὲ Λακεδαιμονίοις καὶ τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις σπονδὰς πεποιημένοις ἐν τοῖς ἔπανω χρόνῳ συνεβάινεν μένειν τὴν εἰρήνην μέχρι τούδε τῶν καιρῶν. Naturally he makes no allusion to the condemnation of the two Athenian generals, which evidently belongs to a totally different story. His own story, probably taken from Ephorus, seems to have arisen from the garbled versions of the Athenian orators, who, to gratify the national vanity, ante-dated the enthusiasm against Sparta caused by the affair of Sphodrias (§ 34), and mixing up the unauthorized help lent the Theban patriots by the two Athenian generals on the frontier with the measures then adopted against Sparta on the proposal of Cephalus, represented a large force as sent out by the formal vote of the Athenian Assembly: cp. Deinarchus, i. 39 ταυτὶ τὰ μικρὰ πρὸ τῆς ἡμετέρας ἡλικίας γεγενημένα ὑπὸ Κεφάλου τοῦ ῥήτορος καὶ Θράσωνος τοῦ Ἑργίκεως καὶ Ἡλίου Φορμισίου καὶ ἐτέρων ἀνδρῶν ἀγαθῶν, ὧν ἐνίων ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἔζη τὰ σώματα. τούτων γὰρ οἱ μὲν φρουρούμενοι ὑπὸ Λακεδαιμονίων τῆς Καδμείας βοηθῆ-

Grote, ix. 313 note, 507 note. Owing to the lacuna τὸ πράγμα κ.τ.λ. cannot be explained.
        § 10. ὁ ... ἁρμοστῆς. Diod. xv. 27 speaks of τοὺς ἡγεμόνας τῆς φρουρᾶς τρεῖς ὄντας, and Plut. Pel. 13 calls them all harmosts. Probably, however, Lysanoridas alone was the proper harmost, the two others were subordinate generals: cp. Daem. Socr. 576 Λυσανορῖδαν τρίτον αὐτῶν.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τῶν προσούτων ἀπάντων</lemma>. Diodorus (xv. 26), following a different version (cp. § 9 note), estimates the besieging force at 12,000 hoplites and 2,000 cavalry, including a large Athenian army. He says that the garrison at once despatched messengers to Sparta for help, and meanwhile defended themselves vigorously against their assailants: but that the Spartans were so long in sending the necessary aid, that the garrison was obliged to surrender just before the reinforcements arrived. So according to Plut. Pel. 12, 13 Cleombrotus’ army of rescue had already reached Megara, when the garrison surrendered. Both these stories are wholly inconsistent with Xenophon, who evidently means that the garrison surrendered the day after the assassination of the polemarchs.

Diodorus (xv. 29) regards Cleombrotus as the instigator: Σφοδριάδον τοῦ Σπαρτιᾶτου τεταγμένου μὲν ἐφ’ ἡγεμονίας, φύσει δ’ οὗτος μετέωρον καὶ προπετῶς, ἐπεῖον αὐτὸν Κλέομβροτος ὁ βασιλεὺς τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων ἄνευ τῆς γνώμης τῶν ἐφόρων καταλαβεῖσθαι τὸν Πειραιᾶ.

        <pb n="205"/>


        just arrived at between Sparta and Athens and to the political views, so far as known (cp. § 16 note), of Cleombrotus; probably it arose from the fact that Sphodrias was a friend of Cleombrotus (§ 25). Xenophon’s view, reproduced by Plutarch, has found many supporters, including Curtius; but the arguments of Grote (ix. 315) against it are exceedingly strong: they are (1) that the plans, if successful, would have ruined the Theban cause; if however the Thebans meant it to fail, they would have given notice to Athens, which apparently they did not; (2) that, if the Spartans had punished Sphodrias, no breach between Sparta and Athens would have ensued; (3) that Agesilaus with his hatred of Thebes would never have voted for the acquittal of Sphodrias, had there been any suspicion that he had been bribed by the Thebans; (4) that in iii. 5. 3 Xenophon, with just as little cause, had imputed to the Thebans a similar refinement of stratagem in leading up to the outbreak of the Corinthian War. He thinks it therefore more in accordance with the facts to suppose that Sphodrias’ personal ambition was simply fired by the past success of Phoebidas, and in support of this view may be added Plutarch’s description of his character—Pel. 14 εὐδόκιμος μὲν ἐν τοῖς πολέμοις καὶ λαμπρός, ὑπόκοφος δὲ τὴν γνώμην καὶ κενῶν ἐλπίδων καὶ φιλότιμιας ἀνὴρ μεστός: cp. Ages. 24 οὐκ ἄπολιμος μὲν οὐδ’ ἀφιλίμιος ἀνήρ, αἰ δ’ ἐλπίδων μᾶλλον ἢ φρενῶν ἀγαθῶν. μεστός. οὗτος ἐπιθυμῶν ὀνόματος μεγάλου καὶ τῶν ἔφοβίων νομίζων ἔνδοξον γεγονέναι καὶ περιβόητον ἀπὸ τοῦ περὶ Θηβῆς τολμήματος, κ.τ.λ.: cp. Callisthenes, frag. ap. Harpocr. [τὸν Σφοδρίαν] εἶναι λίαν καὶ κούφον πρὸς τὰς ἐλπίδας.
        On the other hand Xenophon’s statement—if we leave out altogether the suspicion of bribery—is very definite; the Theban patriots were in a desperate position, and may have calculated, that, even if Sphodrias’ attack were successful—of which, if the character attributed to him be true, there was after all little chance—they had more to gain than to lose from embroiling Athens in the quarrel with Sparta.</p>

        pride of the Athenian orators. To exalt the part played by the Athenians in the overthrow of the Spartan domination they ante-dated the measures here described in brief by Xenophon, and represented Athens as joining the Thebans immediately after the assassination of the polemarchs (§ 9 note). This activity of Athens showed itself in the next year in the formation of what is known as the Second Athenian Confederacy, cp. §§ 60-61 note. Even in the present year several alliances, besides that with Thebes, were already formed. Isocrates (xiv. 28) goes so far as to say that after the Peace of Antalcidas Χῖοι μὲν καὶ Μυτιληναῖοι καὶ Βυζάντιοι συμπολεμοι (i.e. faithful to Athens), and monumental evidence in a great measure confirms this statement: for CIA. ii. 15 (which Köhler dates at about 386 but Hicks at 378-377) proves that a defensive alliance was formed with the Chians on the basis of the king’s peace ἐς ἅμισον βασιλεὺς καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ Λακεδαιμόνιοι καὶ οἱ ἄλλοι Ἕλληνες; and CIA. ii. 18, 19 show that similar treaties of alliance were formed in the present year 378 with Mytilene and Byzantium. To the same year must belong the despatch of envoys mentioned by Diodorus (xv. 28) ἐπὶ τὰς ὑπὸ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων τεταγμένας πόλεις, παρακαλοῦντες ἀπέχεσθαι τῆς κοινῆς ἐλευθερίας, which that historian incorrectly puts before the attempt of Sphodrias on the Piraeus. Diodorus goes on to say—διόπερ πολλοὶ τῶν ὑπ’ αὐτοὺς τεταγμένων ἀπέκλινον πρὸς τοὺς Ἀθηναίους. πρώτοι δὲ πρὸς τὴν ἀποστασιν ἐπήνεσαν Χῖοι καὶ Βυζάντιοι καὶ μετὰ τούτους Ῥόδιοι καὶ Μυτιληναῖοι καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τινες νησιωτῶν διὰ δὲ μᾶλλον αὐξομένης τῆς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὁρμῆς πολλαὶ πόλεις προσέθεντο τοῖς Ἀθηναίοις. The details which he then gives about the terms of the Confederacy belong to the following year: cp. Plut. Pel. 15 ἐκ τούτου (Sphodrias’ attempt) πάλιν προθυμότατα ’Ἀθηναῖοι τοῖς Θηβαίοις συνημύχον καὶ τῆς θαλάσσης ἀντελάμβανον καὶ πειθόμενοι ἐδέχοντο καὶ προσηγουντο τοὺς ἀποστατικῶς τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχοντας.</p>

<lemma>κατὰ τὸ δόγμα τῶν συμμάχων</lemma>. Diodorus (xv. 31) states that the Lacedaemonians, fearing the spread of rebellion amongst their allies, now ἐπαύσωντο τῆς πρωταρχούσης βαρηνττος καὶ ταῖς πόλεσιν φιλαυθροπῶς προσέφεροντο: and that at the same time they reorganized their confederacy, dividing it into ten parts: the first composed of themselves, the second and third of the Arcadians, the fourth of the Eleans, the fifth of the Achaeans, the sixth of the Corinthians and Megarians, the seventh of the Sicyonians, the Phliasians and the states of the Acte, the eighth of the Acarnanians, the ninth of the Phocians and Locrians, and the tenth of the Olynthians and Thrace-ward allies. Diod. xv. 32 estimates Agesilaus’ forces at more than 18,000 hoplites, of whom 2,500 were Lacedaemonians, divided into five morae, and 1,500 cavalry.

<p>
<lemma>ἀποσταφευγμένα</lemma>. Diod. xv. 32, 33, says nothing of this trench and stockade; he together with Polyaenus (ii. 1. 2) and Nepos (Chabrias 1) represents the poor success of Agesilaus as mainly due to the generalship of the Athenian Chabrias, who joined the Thebans with 15,000 foot and 200 horse: the Thebans and their allies could not be dislodged from their various advantageous positions, and on one occasion, when Agesilaus was marching up against them to force them to give battle, Chabrias gave orders to his men τὰς ἀσπίδας πρὸς τὸ γόνυ κλίναιτας ἐν ὀρθῷ τῷ δόρατι μένειν—
        

        <pb n="210"/>

        a manoeuvre which compelled the Lacedaemonians to retire; Chabrias afterwards chose this attitude for a statue, which the Athenians erected in his honour. Many commentators have seen in this omission of Xenophon’s—if omission it be—evidence of the anti-Athenian tendencies of the author. Stern (p. 74) suggests that the story was afterwards invented to account for the peculiar attitude of the statue. Cp. Dem. xx. 76.</p>

<lemma>τὰ πρὸς ἑαυτοῦ</lemma>: the parts of the country on his own side of the stockade: if the reading be correct, πρὸς is here used in the sense of local direction, and the genitive στραυρωμάτων is dependent on the local conception implied in the phrase πρὸς ἑαυτοῦ: cp. § 49 πρὸς ἔω τῆς πόλεως.

the preceding year in the definite founding of a new Athenian Confederacy, some account of which—in defiance of chronology—is given by Diodorus (xv. 28-30), but for which monumental evidence remains in the original decree (CIA. ii. 17) proposed by Aristoteles—ὁ πολιτευσάμενος Ἀθήνησι, says Diogenes Laertius (v. 35) **οὐ καὶ δικαικῶν φερόμετα λόγον χαριέστες—**in March 377. According to this document an alliance was to be formed between the contracting parties on the basis of the Peace of Antalcidas, which secured freedom and autonomy for the separate states of Greece: and their object was to be to secure this independence against the encroachments of Sparta. The official title of the League was οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι καὶ οἱ σύμμαχοι: the Athenians promised in no way to interfere with the constitutions of the allied states, to send no garrisons, and to extort no tribute (φόρος). The Athenians also gave up all ἐγκτήματα, whether public or private, that they at the time possessed in any of the allied states—any violation of this clause was to be tried by the σύνεδροι τῶν συμμάχων. The allies were to form a συνέδριον in Athens, in which Athens herself was to have no representation. Whatever this συνέδριον approved was to be laid before the Athenian Assembly, which could either accept it or reject it; and the συνέδριον was at liberty to deal in the same way with the proposals of the Athenian Assembly. A list of allies is subjoined, apparently in chronological order of admission: the first to join were the Chians, Mytileneans, Methymnaeans, Rhodians, and Byzantines (cp. § 34 note): then the Tenedians, Thebans, Chalcidians, and many of the Euboean states, cp. § 56 note: the rest follow, as the alliance continually extended: cp. Hicks, Inscrip. p. 141. The omission of this important measure by Xenophon makes it difficult to understand from his pages alone the course of succeeding events. It appears that a few years later συντάξεις (such was the new name invented by Callistratus for the old thing), or contributions were paid by some, though not all, of the allies: but for this cp. vi. 2. 1 note.</p>

Xenophon seems to use the article here, as in his allusions to the sea-fight at Cnidus (iv. 3. 10; 8. 1) to imply that this battle at Naxos in 376 was well known to the reader. Diod. (xv. 34, 35) gives a long but not very intelligible account of the battle. According to him, Chabrias, to create a diversion, sailed with his whole fleet to Naxos and laid siege to the city. Pollis was thereby obliged to leave his blockade of the Attic coasts and sail to the relief of the island. Between Paros and Naxos with 65 ships under his command he fell in with the Athenian fleet of 83 vessels, and inflicted great loss on the Athenian left wing, killing its commander Cedon. Thereupon, however, Chabrias came up and changed the defeat into a victory, sinking many triremes, capturing others, and taking much booty; but was afraid to follow up the pursuit, whereby he might have captured the whole Lacedaemonian fleet, remembering the fate of the Athenian generals at Arginusae; he therefore stopped to pick up the survivors of the 18 ships that he had lost himself and to bury the dead. This was the first victory that the Athenians had won by sea with their own fleet since the Peloponnesian War. Dem. (xx. 77) estimates the Lacedaemonian loss at 49 triremes and 3,000 prisoners. After this victory many more of the islands, including Naxos, joined the new Athenian Confederacy. Cp. also Plut. (Phocion 6, 7; Camill. 19) who puts the date of the battle on the 16th of Boedromion, c. Sept. 10. Chabrias sailed back to Piraeus, laden with the spoils of victory. The people voted him extraordinary honours (Dem. xx. 84-86).

§ 1. Cleombrotus was despatched to the aid of the Phocians, who were now being attacked by the Thebans. §§ 2-16. Polydamas, the Pharsalian, arrived in Sparta and in a lengthy speech asked for help against the ever-increasing power of Jason of Pherae. §§ 17-19. After three days' deliberation the Lacedaemonians were obliged to confess that they were unable to help him. Pharsalus at once submitted and Jason was acknowledged Tagus of all Thessaly.</p>

Before the Corinthian War Pharsalus had been occupied by a Lacedaemonian garrison (Diod. xiv. 82) which was expelled by Medius, tyrant of Larisa, when he captured the town. In 394 the Pharsalians did their best to hinder Agesilaus' march through Thessaly, cp. iv. 3. 3, 8. Now the philo-Laconian party seem once more to have been in the ascendant, and applied for help to their old allies. In Aristotle's time the Pharsalian constitution was a harmonious oligarchy : Pol. v. 6. 10 ἐκεῖνοι γὰρ ὀλίγοι ὄντες πολλῶν κύριοι εἰσι διὰ τὸ χρῆσθαι σφίσιν αὐτοῖς καλῶς.</p>

The earliest known exploit of Jason himself is the assistance that he gave to Neogenes, when the latter made himself tyrant of Oreus in Euboea shortly before 378 B.C. (cp. Diod. xv. 30 and v. 4. 56). Meantime he had seized advantage of the troubles in Greece to increase his own dominions.</p>

§§ 1-7. The Athenians, alarmed at the growth of Thebes, made peace with the Lacedaemonians, and accordingly recalled Timotheus from Corcyra. On his way home he replaced some Zacynthian exiles. The Lacedaemonians, thinking this a breach of the peace, despatched 60 ships under the admiral Mnasippus to Corcyra. He ravaged the country and blockaded the city.
§§ 8-14. The Corcyraeans sought help from the Athenians, who first sent 600 peltasts under Ctesicles across the continent to the island, and voted to equip a fleet and chose Timotheus to command it. Being unable to equip the ships properly, he lingered round the islands. Angry at the delay, the Athenians replaced him by Iphicrates, who took strong measures to make the ships ready. §§ 15-26. The Corcyraeans were so hard pressed by famine, that Mnasippus relaxed his watchfulness and neglected to pay his mercenaries. His troops were defeated and he himself slain. Soon afterwards his secretary sailed to Leucas with the remnant of his forces. §§ 27-31. Iphicrates on his voyage to Corcyra showed great ingenuity in training his crews. At the time of Mnasippus' death he was at Sphagia, but he first got certain news of it in Cephallenia. § 32. Xenophon's comment. §§ 33-38. After subjugating Cephallenia Iphicrates arrived in Corcyra; there he captured 10 triremes, which in ignorance of his death were sailing in from Dionysius to the aid of Mnasippus. Iphicrates maintained his armament, partly by allowing his sailors to cultivate the fields for the Corcyraeans, partly by hiring out his troops to friendly cities on the mainland. Then he exacted money from the Cephallenians and prepared to renew the war with the Lacedaemonians. § 39. Xenophon's comment on Iphicrates' choice of Callistratus and Chabrias for his colleagues.</p>

συνελέγοντο. Four morae and contingents from the allies under Cleombrotus had been conveyed across the Corinthian Gulf into Phocis, vi. i. 1.

<pb n="225"/>

αὐξανομένους ... διὰ σφᾶς : cp. v. 4. 62 ff.</p>

<p>
<lemma>χρήματα </lemma>... εἰς τὸ ναυτικόν. In Aristotle's decree of the year 377 (cp. v. 4. 60 note) there is no provision for any money contributions on the part of the allies; and in line 23 there is the express statement μητὲ φόρον φέροντι, so that the συντάξεις proposed by Callistratus (cp. Harpocrat. s. v.) instead of the φόρος must have been of later institution, and very probably, as in the earlier empire, were only paid by some of the allied states in commutation of their contingents of ships or troops: cp. Isocr. vi. 2 τῆς πόλεως (i.e. Athens) ἐπὶ συμμάχους ἔχουσίας πολλοὺς μὲν τοὺς ἑτοίμως ἡμῖν, ἡν τι δεῇ, βοηθοῦντας, πολλῷ δὲ πλείους τοὺς τὰς συντάξεις ὑποτελοῦντας καὶ τὸ προσταττόμενον ποιοῦντας. Xenophon in this passage must therefore mean that though the Thebans were bound as members of the Confederacy to render assistance against Sparta, as a matter of fact they did so neither by sending men or ships, nor by contributing money: hence the Athenian discontent. Cp. Gilbert, Gk. Antiq. p. 443.</p>

<p>
<lemma>εἰσφοράς</lemma>: taxes on income, only levied in times of war by special vote of the Assembly. The method of assessment had been altered in the archonship of Nausinicus, when the system of συμμορίαι was first introduced: cp. Gilbert, Gk. Antiq. p. 364 ff.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ληστείας ἐξ Αἰγίνης</lemma>. Sufferings from this same cause had in 387 inclined the Athenians towards peace: cp. v. 1. 29.</p>

<p>
<lemma>πρέσβεις</lemma>: Callias was among their number: cp. vi. 3. 4.</p>

<p>
<lemma>εἰρήνην ἐποίησαντο</lemma>. What the actual conditions of this Peace may have been, cannot in the conflict of evidence be determined; its duration was so exceedingly short, that it was of little practical importance. Isocrates (xv. 109), writing more than twenty years later, speaks of it in exaggerated terms—τὴν εἰρήνην, ἣ τοσαύτην μεταβολὴν ἑκατέρα τῶν πόλεων ἐποίησεν, ὡστ' ἡμᾶς μὲν ἀπ' ἐκείνης τῆς ἡμέρας ἑνὶ αὐτῇ καθ' ἕκαστον τὸν ἐνιαυτὸν ὡς οὐδεμίας ἄλλης οὕτω τῇ πόλει συνενεχούσης, Λακεδαιμονίων δὲ μετ' ἐκείνων τὸν χρόνον μηδ' ὑφ' ἐμοῦ ἑωράσθαι μήτε ναυτικὸν ἐντὸς Μαλεας περιπλέον μήτε πεζὸν στρατοπεδεῦον δι' Ἰσθμοῦ πορευόμενον. Similarly Demosthenes (xxii. 15) says—εἰρήνης ἔτυχης ὁποίας τυνὼ ἠβουλέσθε. The Peace must therefore have contained some provision recognizing the powerful position of Athens at sea: cp. Cor. Nep. Timoth. 2 Lacedaemonii ... sua sponte Atheniensibus imperii maritimi principatum 
<pb n="226"/>

concesserunt, pacemque iis legibus constituerunt ut Athenienses mari duces essent. quae victoria tantae fuit Atticis laetitiae, ut tum primum arae Paci publice sint factae eique deae pulvinar sit institutum. This view is confirmed by the silence of Xenophon, who habitually neglects all operations by sea and has given no account of the growth of the Second Athenian Empire; and by a statement of Diodorus (xv. 38)—which occurs outside the limits of the passage, which has excited such controversy and of which more hereafter—Λακεδαιμόνιοι μὲν γὰρ καὶ Ἀθηναῖοι, διὰ παντὸς περὶ τῆς ἡγεμονίας διαπληκτιζόμενοι, παρεχώρουν ἀλλήλοις, οἱ μὲν τῆς κατὰ γῆν, οἱ δὲ τῆς κατὰ θάλατταν ἀρχῆς ἄξιοι κρινόμενοι. Xenophon, Isocrates, Demosthenes, and Nepos all agree in describing Athens and Sparta as the only parties to the Peace.
Diodorus in the passage above referred to (xv. 38) ascribes the Peace, which he puts a year too soon, to the intervention of the Persian king, Artaxerxes, who hoped to hire large numbers of Greek mercenaries for the war against his rebellious subjects in Egypt. The Greeks, weary of the long wars, gladly accepted his intervention, and all agreed, with one exception, ὥστε πάσας τὰς πόλεις αὐτονόμους καὶ ἀφρούρητους εἶναι. The Thebans alone refused the terms, wishing to sign the conditions in the name of all the Boeotians, and thus they became ἔκτοποι. This seems to be an obvious duplicate of the history of the Peace of Callias in 371, and to be inconsistent with the context in Diodorus himself and with the other authorities. For (1) Isocrates in his Plataean oration (373 B.C.) § 41 says that for a long time the Persian king had taken no part in Greek affairs; (2) if all Greek states were to be αὐτόνομοι and ἀφρούρητοι, the Peace could hardly at the same time have recognized the ἡγεμονία of Athens by sea and of Sparta by land; (3) the Thebans so far from being ἔκτοποι in the years 374-371 remained members of the new Athenian Confederacy, supplied their contingents of ships and claimed pay from the Confederate Chest for the same (Dem. xlix. 10, 11, 21, 49). For a full discussion of this curious duplicate cp. Stern, pp. 93-99.

<lemma>εὐθὺς  ... κατεσκευάζον</lemma>: Diod. xv. 45 adds that the Lacedaemonians first sent ambassadors to Athens to complain: then seeing that the Athenians sided with the exiles, sent a fleet of 25 triremes under Aristocrates to help the Zacynthians. At the same time in response to the appeal of the Corcyraean oligarchs, they despatched 22 triremes under Alcidas to that island—on the ostensible pretext of sending them to Sicily. Diodorus never relates what were the fortunes of these two squadrons; but in ch. 47 tells how the Lacedaemonians appointed Mnasippus general and despatched him to Corcyra with 65 triremes and 1,500 soldiers. As it is not to be supposed that the Lacedaemonians had at this time 112 triremes at sea, we must presume that Mnasippus incorporated the two previous squadrons with his own fleet. Diodorus puts Mnasippus' departure after that the Athenians had despatched Ctesicles.</p>

</p></div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10"><p>
<lemma>πέμπουσι Κτησικλέᾳ</lemma>. Xenophon evidently means that Ctesicles marched by land through Thessaly and Epirus. Diodorus makes him proceed to Corcyra by sea, and gives a double and confused version of his appointment: in xv. 46 he says that the Athenians on receiving the application of the Corcyraeans immediately despatched Ctesicles (Stesicles) to Zacynthus before the appointment of Mnasippus by the Spartans: and again in xv. 47 he represents them after the appointment of Mnasippus and the return of Timotheus from Thrace as choosing Ctesicles as general κατὰ τὸ παρόν and hurriedly sending him with 500 soldiers to Corcyra. Xenophon's account is evidently to be preferred: cp. Grote, ix. 364, 371, who conjectures with great ingenuity and some small probability that Timotheus conveyed Ctesicles and his troops northwards to Thessaly, made an alliance with Jason of Pherae, and thus procured the safe conduct of Ctesicles' troops through Thessaly. This conjecture is, however, scarcely consistent either with Xenophon or Diodorus.</p>

<p>
<lemma>Ἀλκέτου</lemma>: cp. vi. I. 7 note, where Jason calls him his ὑπήκοος,
<pb n="229"/>
It is noticeable that at that time (374) Jason was not yet an ally of Athens: he certainly was so in Nov. 373 (cp. ps.-Dem. xlix. 10): hence Grote (l.c.) conjectures that it was at this time that the alliance was effected (cp. § 12 note); basing his conjecture on the strong personal interest that Jason manifested in the fate of Timotheus at his trial in November, and on Diodorus' statement that Timotheus sailed ἐπὶ Θρᾴκης.

This probably took place about June: but he was not actually tried until November, when he was acquitted, chiefly—according to the same authority—owing to the appearance
<pb n="230"/>

of his powerful friends Jason and Alcetas as witnesses in his behalf. Diodorus' account is inconsistent both with Xenophon and Demosthenes: he states (xv. 47) that Timotheus was first deprived of his command, but when he appeared at Athens bringing with him many ambassadors with offers of alliance, 30 additional triremes and abundant supplies, he was reappointed, and shortly before the defeat and death of Mnasippus set sail for Corcyra with Iphicrates as his colleague.

Xenophon wishes apparently to remark that if Iphicrates regarded
his colleagues as rivals, he was so sure of his own skill and com-
petence as a general as to feel confident that they would be unable
to use their position as a handle against him. Of the proposed
emendations Jacob's οὕτως ἐθάρσει (rather ἐθάῤῥει) μήτε ... φαίνεσθαι
seems therefore to be the best, though the same meaning can
perhaps be extracted out of the MSS. reading by supplying ἐβουλεύετο
with φαίνεσθαι. Hertlein's ἐθάρσει ὡς or Keller's ἔπραττεν ὡς can
hardly stand, as the reference must evidently be to Iphicrates'
motive in making the appointments, not to his action after the
appointment was made.</p>

§§ 1-3. The Athenians, displeased at the conduct of the Thebans, more
especially towards Plataea and Thespiae, invited them to send envoys to
Sparta to negotiate a general peace. §§ 4-9. Callias first addressed the
Spartans and their allies, advocating peace: then Autocles, complaining
that Sparta had violated the terms of the King's Peace. §§ 10-17. Finally
Callistratus made a conciliatory speech. §§ 18-20. The Lacedaemonians
accepted the conditions proposed, agreeing that should these terms be violated,
any state might aid the injured party, but there should be no compulsion so to
do. The Spartans swore to the Peace both for themselves and for their allies,
the Athenians and their allies swore severally. The Thebans, having first
signed their own name, claimed next day to swear for all the Boeotians.
Agesilaus disallowed the claim, and the Theban envoys retired disheartened.

and now they were detected in an intrigue with Athens, meaning
to hand over their city to their old supporter. The Boeotarchs
however anticipated the attempt, and seized the city, whilst the
men were away working in the fields; they then razed the city
to the ground, allowing the inhabitants to retire in safety to Athens,
where they were once more welcomed and admitted to ἰσοπολιτεία.
This event happened in 372, cp. Paus. ix. 1. 3.</p>

afterwards (Diod. xv. 86) except that its inhabitants were not so
fortunate as to find a refuge at Athens. They continued to live in
Boeotia-probably κατά κώμας: for they were present in the
Theban army at Leuctra, being however allowed to withdraw just
before the battle: cp. vi. 4. 9 and note; Paus. ix. 14. 2. After the
battle they seem to have retired, in fear of Theban vengeance,
to an ancient stronghold of theirs, called Ceressus, from which they
were then expelled by Epaminondas: cp. Paus. ix. 14. 4.</p>

Phocis, and in 448 had entrusted the Delphic shrine to their

ready προθύμως . . . κατὰ τὴν Ἀθηναίων ἀεί ποτε φιλίαν ξυστρατεύειν ἢ

map of Greece: cp. ii. 2. 19; Dem. xix. 65; Plut. Lys. 15.</p>

pointed out, cp. vi. 2. I note) is a curious duplicate of his account
of the Peace of 374-that the impulse came on this occasion also
from the King of Persia. Diodorus does indeed receive some

Antalcidas had not yet returned, so that the conditions of the
proposed Peace would have to be discussed in ignorance of Persian
wishes. The fact that the Peace of 387-386 was taken as the basis
of the Peace of 371 is in itself sufficient to account for Diodorus
(xv. 50) speaking of Persian intervention on this occasion. Cp. v.
i. 29. Plutarch's story (Artaxer. 22) of a second visit of Antal-
cidas to the Persian court to get money after the battle of Leuctra

<lemma>εἰ δέ τις </lemma>... ποιῇ. Herein lies the great difference between this Peace of 371 and the Peace of Antalcidas of 387–386 (cp. v. 1. 31, 36), the provisions of which Sparta had enforced in her own interests. Under the new treaty such enforcement was made anybody’s business, in other words, nobody’s business. Any state might encroach upon its neighbors without much fear of interference. Probably too Athens foresaw further troubles between Sparta and Thebes, from which she herself was anxious to be free; nor would Sparta be averse to such neutrality on the part of Athens, which would leave her freer to deal with Thebes (cp. Stern, p. 122), however much she might dislike the proclamation of autonomy applied to her own Peloponnesian Confederacy as well as to the Boeotian Confederacy of Thebes.

acknowledge the autonomy of the allies in her confederacy, so that her action was not, as Grote seems to suppose (ix. 384), inconsistent with the terms of the Peace  τοῖς πόλεσιν αὐτονόμοις εἶναι (cp. v. i. 31 note). She was the head of an old established confederacy, and her relations to its several members were traditional and well known. Athens on the other hand had only just succeeded in forming a new maritime confederacy (cp. v. 4. 60 note), and could not pretend in any way to guarantee the acquiescence of its members in her wishes, so that they gave in their adhesion separately.</p>

<p>
<lemma>οἱ Θηβαῖοι</lemma>. Stern (p. 130) supposes that on the first day the Thebans swore as a separate member of the Athenian Confederacy, which they had joined simply as Thebans before they had re-asserted their supremacy over the other Boeotian states (cp. CIA. ii. 17 and v. 4. 60 note); and that then, having reflected that the Peace was practically but a reassertion of the Peace of Antalcidas, under which they had been forced to recognize the autonomy of the Boeotian states (cp. v. i. 33), on the next day they came forward with their new proposal, which amounted to a recognition of the whole of Boeotia as a single state, like Athens with her demes, or Sparta with her Laconian and Messenian towns.</p>

<p>
<lemma>οἱ πρόεβες αὐτῶν</lemma>: for a similar duplication of the subject cp. iv. 4. 1; v. 4. 40. According to Plutarch (Ages. 27, 28) and Pausanias (ix. 13. 2), who wrongly refers his story to the time of the Peace of Antalcidas, Epaminondas was among their number and made a bitter speech against the Spartans. Grote and other modern historians have preferred Plutarch’s version to Xenophon’s; but Stern (p. 126 ff.) shows almost conclusively that his story will not bear serious criticism, and that Xenophon’s account has at least the merit of being logical and self-consistent.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἀντὶ Θηβαίων Βοιωτούς</lemma>. Cp. their similar behaviour in 387-386 Then Agesilaus refused to accept their oath, unless at the same time they swore αὐτονόμους εἶναι καὶ μικρὰν καὶ μεγάλην πόλιν, and after some show of opposition they were obliged to submit— αὐτονόμους ἀφένεταις τὰς Βοιωτίας πόλεις. Now that they had made themselves masters of all or nearly all the other Boeotian towns (vi. 1. 1) this request amounted to a demand for the legal recognition of their actual supremacy in Boeotia.

§§ 1-3. The Athenians scrupulously carried out the conditions of the peace: the Lacedaemonians withdrew their harmosts and garrisons, but notwithstanding the remonstrances of Prothous, ordered Cleombrotus, then in Phocis, to march against the Thebans. The king eluded the Theban army by marching through Thisbe to Creusis, where he captured 12 triremes. §§ 4-8. Then he encamped at Leuctra. The Thebans encamped on the opposite hill. Cleombrotus, urged by friends and foes alike, was eager to fight. The Theban generals had many reasons for wishing for a battle. Omens and fortune favoured the Thebans. §§ 9-12. Battle of Leuctra.—First the Lacedaemonian auxiliaries drove a train of stragglers back to the Boeotian camp. The cavalry on both sides were posted in front, the Theban being much superior. The Lacedaemonians were drawn up 12 deep, the Thebans on the left wing 50 deep. §§ 13-16. Then the cavalry engaged, and the Lacedaemonians, easily worsted, fell back in disorder upon their own infantry. On the right wing Cleombrotus fell, and the troops around him were pressed back by the heavy Theban phalanx. Then the left wing gave way. The Lacedaemonians retreated no further than their original camp. The polemarchs refused to renew the combat, and sent a herald to recover the corpses. The Spartans at home received the news in true Spartan fashion. §§ 17-18. The Lacedaemonians sent out reinforcements under Archidamus, many of their allies showing great zeal. §§ 19-26. The Theban herald of the victory met with a bad reception at Athens; but Jason of Pherae on hearing the news marched hastily into Boeotia. Arrived at Leuctra he dissuaded the Thebans from attacking the Spartan camp, and advised the Lacedaemonians to come to terms. A truce was made; the Lacedaemonian
<pb n="243"/>
army retired by night and fell in with Archidamus in the Megarid. §§ 27-32. Jason returned to Thessaly at the summit of his glory and power. He was engaged in making magnificent preparations to attend the Pythian games, when he was assassinated by seven youths. Such of his assassins as escaped were held in high honour among the Greeks as tyrannicides. §§ 33-37. His brothers Polydorus and Polyphron were appointed Tagoi in his place: Polydorus died suddenly, murdered, it was thought by his brother. Polyphron reigned tyrannically for a year, when he was murdered by Alexander, who ruled with equal ferocity. He too was murdered by his wife’s brothers at the instigation of their sister. Tisiphonus, the elder of them, succeeded him.</p>

It appears from vi. 3. 1 that the Thebans were once more threatening the Phocians, and it follows from this passage that this year also, as in 374, Cleombrotus had been despatched with an army to their assistance. The article with στρατεύμα may be due either to an oversight of Xenophon, who has not mentioned it before, or may simply imply that this was the famous army which fought at Leuctra. Beloch, however (Gr. Gesch. ii. 244 note), supposes that Xenophon has erroneously in vi. 1. I antedated the expedition of Cleombrotus.

<lemma>ταῦτα ἀκούων ... συνάπτειν</lemma>: cp. Cic. de Offic. i. 24. 84 cum Cleombrotus invidiam timens temere cum Epaminonda conflixisset, Lacedaemoniorum opes corruerunt. Diodorus (xv. 50-54) gives an account of the circumstances leading to the battle different in all respects. According to him a whole winter intervened between the negotiations for the Peace and Cleombrotus’ campaign. In the following year after collecting large forces the Lacedaemonians sent ambassadors to Thebes with an ultimatum, which was rejected. Thereupon Cleombrotus advanced as far as Coronea, where he formed a camp and waited for belated contingents from the allies. Meantime Epaminondas with 6,000 Thebans and Boeotians advanced from Thebes and occupied τὰ περὶ τὴν Κορώνειαν στενά. Finding his communications thus cut off Cleombrotus marched round through Phocis and entered Boeotia once more by the sea coast route, taking up his position at Leuctra, where the Thebans advanced to meet him. The six Boeotarchs in command were equally divided on the question of battle or retreat, until Epaminondas, one of the number, persuaded the seventh Boeotarch on his arrival in the camp to vote for battle. At this juncture, however, Jason arrived with 1,000 Thessalian foot and 500 cavalry and persuaded his allies, the Thebans, to make a truce with the Lacedaemonians. Accordingly Cleombrotus left Boeotia, and shortly fell in with large reinforcements under Archidamus, son of Agesilaus. Confident in their numbers the Lacedaemonians now returned to Leuctra in defiance of the truce. Then followed the famous battle. </p>

<p>This account conflicts not only with Xenophon, but with Isocrates, who puts words into the mouth of Archidamus (vi. 9, 10, 111) which are absurd, if he himself were present in the battle. It does not satisfactorily explain Cleombrotus’ circuitous march through Coronea, Phocis, and Creusis to Leuctra. It accuses the Spartans of one of the most flagrant violations of good faith possible, and yet this violation is not even alluded to by any other ancient authority. It represents the Spartans as making the most elaborate preparations for the campaign during a whole winter, and as collecting contingents from their allies in a manner forbidden by the newly-signed peace of 371. In fact Diodorus’ version is so utterly improbable that it has been generally abandoned:

back upon their own centre, so that the infantry were compelled to
advance in μήνοειδὲς σχήμα. Then Cleombrotus, seeing the depth
of the Theban left, attempted to outflank it by deploying a portion
of his own right wing: before, however, this manoeuvre was com-
pleted Pelopidas with his ἱερὸς λόχος was upon them, and threw
them into some disorder. He was closely followed by Epami-
nondas with the main body. Cleombrotus was wounded, and the
Spartans fought so desperately round their wounded king that
ἰσόρροπος ἦν ἡ μάχη, until at last the weight of the Theban phalanx
began to tell. The Lacedaemonians, so long as their king was
living, gave ground but slowly, but after his death ἐγένετο παντελὴς
τροπὴ τοῦ στρατοπέδου, and the Spartans fled back to their camp on
the slope of the southern hills. The whole struggle was fought out
on the Spartan right, and the troops in the rest of the line do not
seem to have been seriously engaged. In fact Epaminondas had
given orders to his right wing φυγομαχεῖν καὶ κατὰ τὴν ἔφοδον τῶν

<p>

§§ 1-3. After Archidamus had disbanded his forces, the Athenians held a
congress at which all the states present, with the exception of Elis, swore anew
to the King's Peace. §§ 4-5. The Mantineans seized the opportunity to
rebuild their city, much to the chagrin of the Spartans. §§ 6-9. At
Tegea the party of Callibius and Proxenus were in favour of a Pan-Arcadian
league, the party of Stasippus against it. In the first encounter Stasippus
slew Proxenus and a few others. Then, the Mantineans coming to the
support of Callibius, Stasippus and his party took refuge in the temple of
Artemis, whence they were driven out and put to death. §§ 10-14. 800
survivors fled to Sparta. The Lacedaemonians sent out Agesilas against
the Mantineans, who waited in Eutaea for Polytropus' mercenaries, whilst
the other Arcadians, except the Orchomenians, were collecting against him at
Asea. The Mantineans were repulsed in an attack upon Orchomenus, but
in their retreat slew Polytropus. §§ 15-22. Thereupon Agesilas marched
into the territory of Mantinea: he was unable to prevent the junction of the
other Arcadians with the Mantineans, but was himself reinforced by some
Orchomenian peltasts and Phliasian horse. For several days Agesilas
offered battle, but the Mantineans refused to engage, in obedience to the advice
of the Eleans to wait the arrival of the Thebans. Agesilas marched hastily
homewards. The Arcadians then ravaged the territory of the Heraeans.
§§ 23-25. When the Thebans arrived at Mantinea, they found no enemy to
meet them, and prepared to return. They were however overpersuaded
to attempt an invasion of Laconia, especially on hearing, that the perioeci were
<pb n="254"/>



likely to revolt. §§ 26-29. Accordingly the Thebans entered Laconia through
Caryae, the Arcadians through Oeum, the latter overpowering the garrison at
Oeum. After sacking Sellasia the two united armies encamped in the
precinct of Apollo, but did not dare to cross the bridge into Sparta. In alarm
the Spartans enrolled 6,000 helots on promise of liberty: reinforcements too
arrived from various allies. §§ 30-32. The invaders crossed the Eurotas
at Amyclae, whence for three or four days they threatened the city. Finally,
however, they marched southwards, burning the unwalled cities, and for three
days they assaulted Gythium, aided by some of the perioeci. §§ 33-36.
The Athenian Assembly now met to consider what should be their attitude
towards Sparta. Certain Lacedaemonians reminded the people of past
occasions, when Athens and Sparta had helped each other. §§ 37-48.
The assembly being divided, Cliteles of Corinth called upon the Athenians to
help punish the aggressions of the Thebans upon Corinthian territory.
Finally Procles of Phlius entreated the Athenians to prevent a Theban
domination and to come to the rescue of Sparta, who had deserved so well of
Greece. §§ 49-50. The Athenians voted to aid Sparta, and appointed
Iphicrates general, who led his forces as far as Corinth. Meanwhile the
Arcadians and other allies in the invading army were melting away and
provisions had become scarce, so that the Thebans were anxious to retire.
§§ 51-52. Xenophon here severely censures Iphicrates’ generalship, because,
when he might have embarrassed their passage across the isthmus, he let the
Thebans pass as they pleased.

to each single state: cp. vi. 3. 18; 4. 10. διεθέσαν probably also

Megalopolis by the concentration in one city of some forty Arcadian
villages. The new city, 50 stadia in circumference, was built in
the SW. of Arcadia to serve as a fortress against Sparta: the date
of the building is variously given between 371 and 368 B.C.,
though probably 371-370 is the right date. Within its walls were
to assemble the Ten Thousand (παν τὸ Ἀρκδικόν, τὸ κοινόν) -
including apparently all Arcadian citizens who chose to attend the
meetings: and a kind of standing army of 5,000 was collected,
known as ἔπάριτοι cp. vii. 4. 22, 34: but the Μεγαλοπολίται,
mentioned in vii. 5. 5, are evidently the ordinary inhabitants of
the new city: cp. Diod. xv. 59 λιχομίδης ὁ Τεγεάτης [a mistake for

<p>
<lemma>εἰ μέν οὖν αὐτὸς ἤρητο</lemma>. Xenophon seems to mean that
Agesilaus found his army formed in column cooped up in a narrow
valley, running north and south, at the entrance of which he stood
himself, while his rear was at the end of it. Then he observed
the enemy passing him on the east slope of the valley and collecting
in order to attack his rear. Accordingly he turned the front or
southern half of his army from column into line (τὰ ὄπλα πρὸς
τοὺς πολεμίους φαίνων) so as to face the enemy passing him on the
east, while at the same time he ordered his rear to turn to the
right ἀναστρέψαντας ... εἰς δόρυ, march a few paces to the west,
then turn into column again to the left, and march on towards the
entrance of the valley ὄπισθεν τῆς φάλαγγος, on the right of which
he himself was standing. Thus, if the rear, as soon as it marched
up in column level with Agesilaus himself on the right (ἥγεισθαι
πρὸς αὐτόν), turned into line again to the left, ἐδεδίπλωτο ἡ φάλαγξ.
Then he ordered his double phalanx once more to turn into
column and οὕτως ἔχοντι τῷ ὁπλιτικῷ advanced into the plain, where
he once more turned his column into line of the usual depth (ἐπ’
ἐννέα ἢ δέκα): cp. Anab. iv. 3. 29.

<lemma>οἱ Ἠλεῖοι </lemma>... οἱ Θηβαῖοι. According to Diod. xv. 62 (cp. § 13
note) the Arcadians first sent ambassadors to Athens to ask for
assistance against the aggressions of Sparta, who, meeting with

<pb n="259"/>


a refusal, at once went on to Thebes, and persuaded the Thebans
συμμαχίαν συνθεῖσθαι κατὰ τῶν Λακεδαιμονίων. Diodorus’ version
agrees with the facts presented by Xenophon, except in the time
of the embassy: if this be put a few weeks earlier, a consistent
story can then be made out. The Arcadians, fearing attacks
from Sparta, we must suppose, looked around for allies. Naturally
they appealed first to their nearest neighbours known to be hostile
to Sparta, Elis and Argos, and then to Athens, who had just taken
upon herself the championship of the King’s Peace against all
aggressors (cp. Dem. xvi. 12). Athens refusing all assistance,
Thebes was next appealed to. The Thebans, having overcome
the last vestiges of resistance to their supremacy in Boeotia by
expelling the Thespians from Ceressus (vi. 3. 1; 4. 9, 10 note;
Paus. ix. 14. 4), and by admitting the Orchomenians as allies
(Diod. xv. 57), and being freed by the death of Jason from all fear
of a Thessalian invasion, readily listened to the Arcadian appeal,
and despatched an army under Epaminondas and Pelopidas,
supported by Phocian and Locrian contingents, into Peloponnesus:
cp. Xen. Ages. 2. 23 ἐπεὶ δ’ αὖ τῆς ἐν Λεύκτροις συμφορᾶς γεγονυίας
κατακαίοντο τοὺς ἐν Τεγέᾳ φίλους καὶ ξένους αὐτοῦ οἱ ἀντίπαλοι σὺν

<lemma>Θηβαῖοι</lemma>. Xenophon’s view that the Thebans entered the
Peloponnesus without any previous intention of invading Sparta
is confirmed by Plutarch’s story (Pel. 24) that they anticipated
being in the country so short a time that they had made no
provision for prolonging the tenure of the Boeotarchs’ command,
which terminated about the time of the winter solstice. Epami-
nondas and Pelopidas, however, Plutarch goes on to say, persuaded
their colleagues (or colleague: Corn. Nep. Ep. 2) to disregard
this law, the penalty for which was death, and accordingly on their
return to Thebes four months after the appointed time they were
both accused by their political enemies on the capital charge and
were only acquitted with some difficulty.</p>

to the east), where they fell in with a Spartan post under Alexander,
whom they defeated and slew; the Arcadians across the Sciritis,
where they fell in with Ischolaus; and the Eleans by other more
open roads: all four divisions united at Sellasia. Xenophon in
this passage speaks of the march of the Thebans and Arcadians
only, but later on (§§ 30-50) he speaks of Eleans and Argives in
Laconia, so that there is no real inconsistency between him and
Diodorus.

thereon he applied to Athens for help, and the Athenians sent an
army which compelled the Thebans to permit the burial.

The Athenians assisted them, defeated Eurystheus, and restored
them to the Peloponnesus: cp. Her. ix. 27; Diod. iv. 57. It is a
curious coincidence, almost too remarkable to be merely accidental,
that Isocrates (iv. 54-60) in supporting the same thesis tells these
two same legendary stories to the credit of the Athenians. Isocrates
wrote this Oration about 380, so that it may very well have been

<p>§§ 1-14. Ambassadors from Sparta and her allies came to Athens to arrange the terms of the new alliance. After many speeches, Procles of Phlius supported the proposal of the Council, that the Athenians should hold the command by sea and Sparta by land. The Assembly preferred Cephisodotus' proposal, that the two powers should exercise the supreme command by turns of five days each. §§ 15-17. The allied forces guarded the Isthmus at Oneum. The Thebans, however, surprised the Lacedaemonian and Pellenean detachments, whereon the Spartan commandant foolishly made a truce, allowing them free passage. §§ 18-22. The Thebans with their Peloponnesian allies attacked Sicyon and Pellene and ravaged the Epidaurian territory: then they fought several skirmishes before Corinth, wherein some reinforcements sent by Dionysius did prodigies of valour against them. The Thebans soon turned homewards. Dionysius' troops after an attack on Sicyon returned to Syracuse. §§ 23-26. So far the Thebans and the revolted allies of Sparta had worked heartily together. Now Lycomedes of Mantinea pointed out to the Arcadians that they were likely to become the tools of the Thebans just as formerly they had been of the Lacedaemonians, whereas the supremacy over the Peloponnesus rightly belonged to them. Just then certain successes won against Chabrias and the Lacedaemonians increased the pride of the Arcadians. Thus distrust arose between them and the Thebans and Eleans. § 27. Ariobarzanes' envoy, Philiscus, summoned the Greeks to Delphi to make a general peace. The attempt failed because the Thebans refused to recognise the dependence of Messene upon Sparta. §§ 28-32. With the help of the second reinforcements from Dionysius, which the Athenians wished to use against the Thebans in Thessaly, Archidamus took Caryae, and ravaged Parrhasia. The Arcadians and Argives attempted to cut off the Sicilian troops on their return to Sparta: but Archidamus coming to their aid, gained a complete victory without the loss of a man. The Thebans were not displeased at the tidings. §§ 33-38. Following the lead of Thebes, who wished thereby to gain the supremacy in Greece, many states sent envoys to the Persian Court. Pelopidas was held in highest honour, and at his proposal the king dictated as terms of peace, that Messene should be independent and that Athens should haul up her ships. On their return the Athenians put Timagoras, one of their envoys, to death: the Eleans

<pb n="270"/>


envoy approved of the terms, but the Arcadian spoke contemptuously of the
king's wealth and power. §§ 39-40. The Thebans summoned deputies to
hear the king's terms: the deputies, however, refused to swear to them. The
Arcadians were the first to leave, the rest followed. Then the Thebans sent
round messengers to the separate states to induce them to swear. The
Corinthians refused, and all the rest copied their example. §§ 41-43.
Epaminondas invaded Achaea, and without introducing any political changes
persuaded the Achaeans to join the Theban Confederacy. His policy was,
however, soon reversed. The Thebans sent out harmosts, who expelled the
aristocrats and set up democracies in the Achaean states. The aristocrats
quickly effected their return, and zealously supported Sparta. §§ 44-46.
At Sicyon Euphron with the help of the Argives and Arcadians effected
a democratical revolution. At first he himself and four others were elected
generals: then he got rid of his colleagues, and by the help of mercenaries
made himself tyrant.</p>

a much larger scale: first the Boeotians drove the Corinthians,

even venturing in the heat of their pursuit within the walls. There
they were met by Chabrias and his Athenians, who slew some
of them and forced back the rest. The whole Boeotian force then
came up to their support, but the Athenians ἐκ τῶπον ὑπερθεζίων

but Grote (x. 19) is probably right in regarding it as a separate
expedition. Indeed, according to Diod. xv. 67, the Arcadians im-
mediately after the first Theban invasion of the Peloponnesus had
in a similar manner under the leadership of Lycomedes stormed
the Lacedaemonian town of Pellene some ten miles north of
Sparta on the river Eurotas; and too § 26 compared with § 22

believe, notwithstanding Xenophon’s encomium, that the Arcadians
would have ventured at this time to penetrate far into the southern-
most peninsula of Laconia. Grote accordingly supposes that the
Messenian Asine is meant (cp. Smith’s Dict. of Geography). If his

Ἑλλάδα, παρακαλῶν τοὺς Ἕλληνας διαλῦσαισθαι μέν τοὺς πολέμους,
εἰρήνην δὲ κοινὴν συνθέσθαι. It is difficult to suppose that the
Persian, whether the king or the satrap, took the initiative: Grote
accordingly (x. 20) conjectures that it was at the instance of the
Athenians: Stern (p. 191) with more probability supposes that
the Spartans, remembering the Peace of Antalcidas and its renewal
in 371, now tried to effect once more by foreign aid what they
could not gain by their own prowess. The latter hypothesis is
to some extent confirmed (1) by the part which Dionysius of
Syracuse, the warm ally of Sparta, seems to have played in the
congress (cp. CIA. ii. 51 and Köhler’s comments on it in Mitth.
d. arch. Instit. i. 15); (2) by Philiscus’ raising mercenaries
apparently to aid the Lacedaemonians; and (3) by the Thebans
sending ambassadors to Susa in the following year to counteract
the influence of the Spartan envoy Euthycles at the Persian Court,
§ 33.</p>

<p>
<lemma>συνήγαγε</lemma>. It is to be supposed, whether Philiscus’ mission
emanated from the king or from Ariobarzanes, that the meeting
of deputies from the various Greek states, including the Lacedae-
monians and their enemies the Thebans, could be convened under
no less authority than that of the Great King himself: cp. v.
1. 30. The general change in the posture of affairs in Greece is
marked by the congress meeting at Delphi instead of Sparta or
Athens.</p>

51 note. Also according to Isocr. vi. 11 the allies in their anxiety
for peace were eager for the Spartans to abandon their claim to
Messenia: but according to Diodorus (xv. 70) the negotiations
failed, as in 371 B.C., because the Thebans once more refused
to recognize the autonomy of the Boeotian cities.</p>

but he too says nothing more about the mercenaries. The motives
therefore, whether of Ariobarzanes or Artaxerxes, remain quite in
the dark: for it is difficult to suppose that Ariobarzanes was
already meditating his revolt from Darius, which did not take
place till 362 B.C. It must have been at the time of the Delphian
Congress that the Athenians honoured Ariobarzanes and Philiscus
with the citizenship: cp. Dem. xxiii. 141. It does, however, appear
from the last words of the sentence that Persia still meant to
support Sparta: cp. § 33.

<p>
<lemma>Ἀθηναίων</lemma>. According to Diodorus it was not till later in the
summer that the Athenians became the allies of Alexander of
Pherae, after that he had seized Pelopidas and Ismenias: but
monumental evidence (CIA. ii. 52 and 52 b c) shows that in
this year Athens formed an alliance with Dionysius of Syracuse,
and tried to strengthen her power in Mytilene and Leucas, while
later on Iphicrates was sent (Aeschin. ii. 29) with a squadron
into Macedonian waters; so that we must suppose, that the
successes of the Thebans in the North in 369 had already roused
the Athenians to make every effort to counteract them.</p>

Thessalian affairs, although in vi. 4 he went out of his way to insert
a digression on Thessalian affairs, describing the death of Jason
and the fortunes of his successors down to the reign of Tisiphonus
in 358 B.C. It appears, however, from Diodorus (xv. 67, 71),
Plutarch (Pel. 26-29), and Pausanias (ix. 15) that the first Theban
expedition into Thessaly under Pelopidas was simultaneous with
the second invasion of the Peloponnesus in 369, and was sent in
response to an invitation of the Thessalians to liberate them from
the tyranny of Alexander of Pherae, who had shortly before
murdered his kinsman Polyphron, the Tagus of Thessaly, and
attempted to succeed him in that office. Pelopidas seized Larisa
and Crannon, limited the powers of Alexander to Pherae only, and
reorganized the whole Thessalian constitution. He also interfered

of the great Theban liberator: cp. § 28 note. In 368 the Thessa-

Pherae, when Pelopidas, relying on the reputation he had gained
in Thessaly the previous year, ventured northwards without an
army to act as mediator: after many adventures he was seized
by Alexander and kept as a prisoner, and only rescued by Epami-
nondas at the head of a powerful Theban army shortly before this

Autocles as sent out in 368 to assist Alexander of Pherae against

§§ 1-9. Though hard pressed by the Argives and Sicyonians, the Phliasians
persisted in their friendship with the Lacedaemonians. They had already
proved their fidelity at the time of the Theban invasion of Laconia; and again,
when the Thebans were once more about to enter Peloponnesus, they delivered
their city from the Argives and their allies, even after a traitorous party had
actually seized the acropolis. §§ 10-16. Next year the Phliasians again
repelled an attack of the Argives and Arcadians. At another time the
Theban governor of Sicyon together with Euphron and the Sicyonians and
Pellenians entered the Phliasian territory on a marauding expedition, but
was speedily driven out with considerable loss. Again the Phliasians
released a Pellenian prisoner without a ransom. §§ 17-23. The
Phliasians were hard pressed for provisions: some they got by forays,
some by purchase from Corinth. Chares acted as escort of their convoys.
On one occasion he was persuaded to join them in an attack upon the
Sicyonians, who were fortifying the outpost of Thyamia. The enemy were
taken by surprise, and the Phliasians made the outpost into a fort of
their own.

§§ 1-5. Aeneas, general of the Arcadians, resolved to put an end to the tyranny of Sicyon. Euphron fled to the harbour, which he delivered over to the Lacedaemonians. With the help of some mercenaries he once more made himself master of the city, though the Theban harmost still retained the acropolis. Then he set out to Thebes to persuade the authorities to recognize his supremacy in Sicyon. His enemies followed him and murdered him there. §§ 6-12. The Theban magistrates brought the assassins before the Council. All denied the charge save one who defended the righteousness of the act. The Thebans acquitted the accused: but the Sicyonian democrats buried Euphron in their market-place and still worship him as their founder.

<p>§ 1. Oropus was seized by some exiles. The Athenians marched to
recover the place, sending for Chares from Thyamia. The Sicyonians
recaptured their harbour. Being unsupported by their allies, the Athenians
retired, leaving Oropus in the hands of the Thebans to await arbitration.
§§ 2-3. Lycomedes persuaded the Arcadian Ten Thousand to allow him to

negotiate an alliance with Athens. He was successful in his mission, but
perished on his return voyage. §§ 4-5. The Athenians planning a
surprise upon Corinth, the Corinthians dismissed their Athenian garrison and
refused to admit Chares and his fleet. §§ 6-11. The Corinthians, weary
of war, asked the Thebans if they would consent to a peace with themselves
and their allies. Receiving a favourable answer, they laid their proposals
before the Spartans; and though the Spartans refused to end the war so
long as Messene remained independent, the Corinthians, Phliasians, and
others made their peace with the Thebans. The Argives, however, failed to
comply with its conditions. §§ 12-14. Some Sicilian troops sent by
Dionysius the Younger helped the Lacedaemonians to recover Sellasia. The
Eleans having seized Lasion, the Arcadians invaded their country, defeated
them in battle, captured many of their cities, garrisoned the Cronion, and
penetrated as far as the market-place of Elis. §§ 15-16. Previous to this
the democrats in Elis had allied themselves with the Arcadians and seized the
acropolis. Being expelled from thence and exiled, they had seized on Pylos.
§§ 17-18. Afterwards the Arcadians made another attempt to capture Elis,
but were prevented by the Achaeans: in revenge they seized Olurus, which,
however, after a long siege was recovered by the Pellenians oligarchs.
§§ 19-25. Once more the Arcadians invaded Elis. To create a diversion
Archidamus and the Lacedaemonians seized Cromnus. The Arcadians
thereupon besieged the Spartan garrison in Cromnus, and foiled all Archi-
damus’ efforts to relieve it, in one skirmish wounding Archidamus and
slaying many of his followers. §§ 26-27. The Eleans captured Pylos,
putting all the democratical exiles to death. The Lacedaemonians succeeded
in rescuing most of their troops besieged at Cromnus. The remainder fell
into the hands of the enemy. §§ 28-32. The Arcadians strengthened
their garrison at Olympia, meaning with the help of the Pisatans to celebrate
the Olympic festival. When the day arrived, the Eleans attempted to
dispossess them, and actually penetrated as far as the Great Altar, having
performed prodigies of valour beyond belief. §§ 33-35. The Mantineans
having refused to handle the sacred treasures were condemned by the Ten
Thousand of breaking up the Arcadian League. Their example spread, and
the Ten Thousand voted to use no more of the treasures. This vote
strengthened the oligarchs, so that their opponents in alarm invited Theban
interference. Then the Arcadians made peace with the Eleans and restored
to them the presidency over the temple of Zeus. §§ 36-40. While the
Arcadians were celebrating the peace at Tegea, the Theban commandant at
the solicitation of certain Arcadians arrested all the oligarchs on whom he
could lay hands. Next day the Mantineans demanded the release of their
fellow citizens and offered to go bail for all the rest, until they should be duly
tried. The Thebans released them all. An accusation was brought against the
commandant at Thebes. Epaminondas threatened to march into Arcadia.

<p>
<lemma>Ὠροπος </lemma>. . . κατελήφθη. Oropus, a sea-port on the Euripus,
near the mouth of the Asopus, as commanding the frontier and the
road across it as well as the passage of the Euripus, had always
been a bone of contention between the Boeotians and Athenians.
At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War it had been held by the
Athenians (Thuc. ii. 23); in 412 it was betrayed to the Boeotians
(Thuc. viii. 60), but shortly afterwards must have become inde-
pendent, for in 402 the Thebans in response to some Oropian
fugitives, who as the result of internal dissensions had been exiled,
made themselves masters of the city, rebuilt the town seven stadia
away from the sea (Diod. xiv. 17), and after an interval incorporated
it with Boeotia. Once more the Oropians seem to have recovered
independence, perhaps in accordance with the Peace of Antalcidas;
for Isocrates about 373 (xiv. 20) speaks of its restoration to Athens
by the voluntary act of the Oropians themselves, probably as the
result of some further internal troubles; and in the same speech
(§ 37) speaks of constant intrigues on the part of the Thebans to
recover the town. Diodorus (xv. 76) gives a different account of
the Athenian loss of Oropus here recorded (which, however, is not
irreconcilable with Xenophon’s) — Θεμισίων Ἐρετριεὺς τύραννος
Ὠρωπὸν κατείληφετο’ ταύτην δὲ τὴν πόλιν οὐσαν Ἀθηναίων παραλόγως
ἀπέβαλε, τῶν γὰρ Ἀθηναίων στρατευσάντων ἐπ’ αὐτὸν καὶ πολλῶ ταῖς
δυνάμεσιν ὑπερεχόντων, οἱ Θηβαῖοι βοηθήσαντες αὐτῷ καὶ παραλαβόντες
ἐν παρακαταθήκη τὴν πόλιν οὐκ ἀπέδοκαν. Probably, therefore, οἱ
φεύγοντες effected their return to Oropus by the aid of the tyrant
Themison: cp. Dem. xviii. 99; Aeschin. iii. 85.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἐπ’ αὐτόν</lemma>, i.e. against Oropus; Hartman, however, supposes
that after κατεληφθη a whole sentence in which the name of
Themison appeared, has fallen out, and accordingly refers the
pronoun to him: cp. Critical Note.
ὁ λῃστή: cp. viii. 3. 2.</p>

<p>
<lemma>μέχρι δίκης</lemma>: whether this arbitration ever took place, and what
share the Athenian general Chabrias and the statesman Callistratus
had in the affair, is a matter of hopeless uncertainty owing to the
confusion of the authorities: cp. Grote, x. 47; Schaefer, Dem. 93 sqq.
Oropus at any rate long remained in the hands of the Thebans.

§§ 1-3. Fearing that Thebes would enslave the Peloponnesus the Mantineans and their allies, who were oligarchically inclined, appealed for aid to Athens and Sparta. It was agreed that each state should hold supreme command in its own territory. §§ 4-7. Meanwhile Epaminondas set out at the head of a large army from Thebes, and waited for a while at Nemea to intercept the Athenian contingent. Hearing that they would go by sea, he went on to Tegea. § 8. Xenophon’s admiration for Epaminondas’ generalship. §§ 9-10. The enemy were strongly posted at Mantinea, and Agesilaus was already on his way to join them, when Epaminondas resolved to march upon Sparta. A Cretan brought the news to Agesilaus, who had just time to turn back and guard the city. §§ 11-17. Repulsed in his attack upon Sparta, Epaminondas returned to Tegea, where he rested his hoplites, sending his cavalry on to Mantinea. That morning the Athenian cavalry had arrived at Mantinea, and, weary as they were, succeeded in repelling the Thebans. §§ 18-22. Thus Epaminondas felt himself forced to draw on a general engagement, for which his troops made zealous preparations. Marching out of Tegea, by a clever maneuver he led the enemy to expect that he would not fight till the morrow. Much to their surprise he suddenly wheeled round and advanced upon them. §§ 23-25. Epaminondas had strengthened one of his wings at the expense of the other. With the stronger he met the enemy, drove them back, and thus threw the whole army into flight. His death, however, utterly paralysed his troops, so that they could make no use of their victory. §§ 26-27. The battle was completely indecisive in its results, and afterwards the confusion and disorder in Greece were worse than before.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4"><p>
<lemma>Ἐπαμινώνδας...Εὐβοίας...Θετταλῶν πολλούς</lemma>. Xenophon has passed over in silence the efforts of Epaminondas to realize the Theban ἡγεμονία τῆς Ἑλλάδος in the north of Greece and to enforce the Persian rescript of 367 (vii. 1. 36) Ἀθηναίους ἀνέλκειν τὰς ναῦς. In the interval the Thebans had in 364 sent two expeditions into Thessaly against Alexander of Pherae, in the first of which Pelopidas had been slain in the moment of victory at Cynoscephalae, and in the second the Theban commanders Malcitas and Diogiton had defeated the tyrant in several battles, and had forced him to liberate all the towns, which he had subjugated, and to become the subject ally of Thebes. In 363 to strike a blow at the naval power of Athens Epaminondas had at the head of a Theban fleet, which he had created by his own efforts, penetrated as far as Byzantium: Byzantium left the Athenian Confederacy, and the important islands of Chios and Rhodes and the town of Ceos followed the example. During Epaminondas’ absence the Thebans at home, as the excuse of an alleged conspiracy, wrecked a their vengeance on Orchomenus, their only possible rival left in the Boeotian Confederacy, razing the town level with the ground, slaying some of the inhabitants and selling the rest into slavery, cp. Diod. xv. 78, 79; Grote, x. 63-73; Stern, 216-225; Introd. p. xxxiii. At this juncture the affairs in the Peloponnesus, just recorded by Xenophon, interrupted Epaminondas’ schemes of Hegemony by sea, and demanded his instant attention in the south.

Euphranor painted a picture in the Ceramicas at Athens (of which there was a copy at Mantinea) apparently representing Gryllus in the act of striking the Theban commander: the Mantineans afterwards set up an equestrian statue in honour of Gryllus. Cp. Paus. i. 3. 4; viii. 9. 8; 11. 5; ix. 15. 5; Plut. Glor. Athen. 346.

To what time then does Xenophon refer? Dodwell believes that it must be the time for which the mercenary troops had been engaged, and compares vii. 1. 28 ἐξῆκει αὐτῷ ὁ χρόνος, ὃς ἦν εἰρημένος. Schaefer believes that the Theban government had fixed a definite time for the length of the campaign.

<lemma>ἐξετάδη</lemma>... ἡ φάλαγξ. This must mean that Epaminondas brought his army from column into line opposite the enemy. ὑπὸ τοῖς ὑψηλοῖς. Epaminondas seems to have marched under the Maenalian mountains from somewhere near the site of the modern Tripolitza to the Pelagian wood.</p>

<p>
<lemma>παραγαγών ... ἔμβολον</lemma>, ‘having brought the regiments which were marching in column into line (εἰς μέτωπον) he thus strengthened the beak-like formation around himself.’ Xenophon’s brevity makes it impossible to follow exactly Epaminondas’ evolutions: he evidently means to describe the manoeuvre by which the Theban general here, as at Leuctra, vastly increased the depth of the phalanx on the left wing; on his arrival at the mountain Epaminondas must have formed his marching column, headed by himself and his Boeotians, into line by making his men face to the right (ἐξέταδη αὐτῷ ἡ φάλαγξ).


<pb n="307"/>


Then to strengthen τὸ περὶ ἑαυτῶν ἔμβολον he must have changed his line (or part of it) once more into column by making the men face to the right (or left) and brought τοὺς ἐπὶ κέρας πορευομένους λόχους one behind the other, so that when the command to front was again given, the phalanx on the left wing would be of the desired depth. According to Diodorus (xv. 85) the Thebans were posted on the left with the Arcadians next them and the Argives on the right; in the centre were the Euboeans, Locrians, Sicyonians, Messenians, Malians, Aenianians, Thessalians, and the other allies. In the opposing army the Mantineans with the other Arcadians held the right wing; next them stood the Lacedaemonians, and further on the Eleans, Achaeans, etc., the Athenians forming the left wing. It is remarkable that no authority mentions the commander-in-chief on the Lacedaemonian side; in all probability he must have been some nameless Mantinean according to the terms of the alliance (§ 3) ὥσπως ἐν τῇ ἑαυτῶν ἔκαστοι ἡγήσοιντο. Neither does it appear who was in command of the Lacedaemonians themselves. Diodorus (xv. 84) puts the numbers of Epaminondas’ army at more than 30,000 foot and not less than 3,000 horse, of the enemy at more than 20,000 foot and about 2,000 horse.

<lemma>τὸ στρατήγημα ἀντίπρωρον ... προσήγει</lemma>: for the simile cp. Rep. Lac. ii. 10 τὸν λόγον ἕκαστον ὥστερ τριήρη ἀντίπρωρον τοῖς ἐναντίοις στρέφουσι: cp. Grote, x. 102 ‘His column (ἔμβολον) would cut through the phalanx of the enemy, like the prow of a trireme impelled in sea-fight against the midship of her antagonist.’ The words ἔμβαλον διακόψειε continue the metaphor.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τῷ ἰσχυροτάτῳ</lemma>... τὸ ἀσθενέστατον. These words prove that the deep formation applied only to the Thebans and Boeotians on the left wing; the Argives occupied the right: cp. Diod. xv. 85.</p>

<p>
<lemma>βάθος ἐφέξῃς</lemma>: cp. CriticalNote. Rüstow and Köchly’s conjecture ἐφ’ ἕξ ἐφέξῃς is almost certain: it explains the comparison ὥσπερ ὑπλῶν φάλαγγα; the commentators explain the MSS. ἐφέξῃς as equivalent to συνεχές, i.e. without intervals for the ἅμπτω, which is very otiose, as it is followed immediately by the more exact expression ἐφήμιον πεξῶν ἅμπτω: cp. iii. 4. 13 ἱππεῖς ὥσπερ φάλαγξ ἐπὶ τεττάρων παρατεταγμένοι.</p>

<lemma>τοῦ ἱππικοῦ ἔμβολον</lemma>: Diodorus (xv. 85) states that in both armies the cavalry were posted on the wings; this is quite consistent with the present passage, although these words seem to refer only to the cavalry on the left wing; for the ἱππᾶς καὶ ὁπλίτας mentioned just below as opposite to the Athenians were on Epaminondas’ right wing.</p>

<p>
<lemma>τῶν ἑαυτῶν</lemma>: ἑαυτῶν is genitive dependent on τῶν: cp. vii. 1. 13 τῶν τεκέων τούτων.

<lemma>ἐκεῖνος ἔπεσεν</lemma>: the honour of striking the blow was claimed by more than one warrior; cp. Paus. viii. 11. 4 Ἐπαμεινώνδα δὲ ἀποθανεῖν Μαντίναιος μέν ὑπὸ Μαχαιρίωνος Μαντινέως φαίν ἀνὴρ ἴσαῦτος δὲ καὶ Λακεδαμόνιον Σπαρτιάτην λέγουσιν εἶναι τὸν ἀποκτείναντα Ἐπαμεινώνδα, τίθεται δὲ Μαχαιρίων ὄνομα καὶ οὗτοι τῷ ἀνδρί. ὁ δὲ Ἀθηναῖοι ἔχει λόγος, ὁμολογοῦσι δὲ αὐτῷ καὶ Θηβαῖοι, τραθῆνα τὸν Ἐπαμεινώνδα ὑπὸ Γρύλλου (Xenophon’s son). Plutarch (Ages. 35) ascribes the death-blow to a Lacedaemonian Anticrates, whose descendants the Spartans honoured under the name of Μαχαιρίωνες, ὡς μαχαίρᾳ πατάξαντος. Pausanias (l.c.) goes on to describe the death of Epaminondas: ὡς δὲ ἕτερος τοῦ Ἐπαμεινώνδα, ἐκκομίσοουν ἐπὶ ζῶντα ἐκ τῆς παρατάξεως αὐτοῦ. ὁ δὲ τέως μὲν τὴν χεῖρα ἔχων ἐπὶ τῷ τραύματι ἐταλανίσετε καὶ τοὺς μαχομένους ἀφείδω, ὅσον δὲ ἀπέβλεπεν ἔς αὐτοὺς ὠρᾶτο Σκοπήν ὁ ἐπετά, λαβώντος δὲ ἴσον τοῦ ἀγῶνος πέρας, οὕτω τὴν χεῖρα ἀπέσειεν ἀπὸ τοῦ τραύματος, καὶ αὐτὸν ἀφίετα τὴν ψυχὴν ἔθλαψαν ἐνὐὰ Φσιόν ἐγένετο ἡ συμβολή; cp. Paus. ix. 15. 5, 6.

αὐτοῖς... αὐτοῖς: datives of the agent: cp. Oec. 2. 14 ἀποφἐγγειν μον πεῖραι; Mem. ii. 10. 1 ἄν τις σοι ἀποδρά.</p>

<p>
<lemma>διέπεσον</lemma>, i.e. slipped away through the broken ranks of the enemy.</p>

<p>
<lemma>ἐπὶ τοῦ εὐωνύμου</lemma>. If the disposition of the forces be correctly described in § 24, the cavalry interspersed with the ἅμπτω must have left them behind, and then the ἅμπτω and πελαται must have wheeled to the left against the centre of the enemy; this seems to be implied in ἀφίκοντο ἐπὶ τοῦ εὐωνύμου.

After the battle a general peace was concluded, in which the Messenians were allowed to share as a separate state. On this account the Spartans refused to consent to it καὶ μόνοι τῶν Ἑλλήνων ὑπήρχον ἔκσπονδοι, Diod. xv. 89; cp. Polyb. iv. 23; Plut. Ages. 35.</p>
