 TITLE. Ἀνάβασις: this title applies strictly only to the first book of the narrative. The word means ‘a going up.’ The Greeks considered any progress away from the coast, whether out to sea (ἀναπλεῖν) or inland, as here (ἀναβαίνειν), to be ‘a going up.’ Conversely, to return from the interior to the coast was to ‘go down’ (καταβαίνειν), just as to put in to shore from the high sea was to ‘sail down’ (καταπλεῖν). The march of the Ten Thousand became therefore a Catabasis (κατάβασις) as soon as they turned their steps coastward, which they did shortly after the battle at Cunaxa.

CHAPTER I. 
51,1. Δαρείου, etc. : genitive of source [GenSep].1 

γίγνονται: historical present,1 here better called the annalistic or notebook present, which is used as in diaries or notebooks to record incidents, especially births, deaths, and accessions. 

παῖδες δύο: a plural noun is often used with δύο. Darius and Parysatis had in all thirteen children, nine of whom died young. Of the surviving four, these two only are of importance for the narrative. See Introd. § 1.

51,2. μὲν ... δέ: here, as often, these particles are to be translated only by stress of voice on the words which they follow. 

Κῦρος: not to be confused with his more famous ancestor, Cyrus the Great. The following amusing lines are quoted by Robert Browning (Works, Riverside edition, IV, p. xi) as the beginning of a young friend’s poetical translation of the Anabasis:

<cit><quote>
<l>Cyrus the Great and Artaxerxes</l>

<l>(Whose temper bloodier than a Turk’s is)</l>
<l>Were children both of the mild, pious,</l>
<l>And happy monarch King Darius.</l>

51,3. ἠσθένει : the imperfect denotes the continuance of the state. Darius was at this time engaged in quelling a revolt in Media.—
ὑπώπτευε: note the augment.1

τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου: the article, as often, is used for a possessive pronoun, — an end of his life; English prefers a Clause, as that his life was drawing to an end.

51,4. τὼ παῖδε: with the dual, cp. παῖδες δύο, l.1; here the number two is emphasized. The accusative is subject of the infinitive[AccSubj].2

ἀμφοτέρω: regularly takes the predicate position. This order of words gives a colloquial effect, his two sons, both of them. 

παρεῖναι: observe the violation of the rule4 that the accent of verbs is recessive. —
οὖν: now. 

51,5. παρών: supplementary participle, best translated by an infinitive, happened to be there.5 

μεταπέμπεται: for the reason of the summons, see Introd. § 1; cp. this genuine historical present with γίγνονται, l. 1.

51,6. ἀρχῆς: for the province of Cyrus, see map (frontispiece) and Introd. § 3.

σατράπην: predicate accusative, accompanying an object accusative[AccSubj].6 

ἐποίησε: translate as pluperfect. Greek simply refers the act to the past without stating (as English does) the completeness of the act in the past. 

καί: too; δέ, and, is the connective. 

στρατηγόν: see on σατράπην, l.6. Cyrus was appointed to this office when only seventeen. He superseded Tissaphernes, in whom he found a rival and a bitter though secret foe; see Introd. § 3.

51,7. ὅσοι: emphasizes the idea of number already suggested in πάντων. --- εἰς: in; the Greek point of view is that of place ¢o which, the English that of place in which. 

Καστωλοῦ πεδίον: without the article, equivalent to a proper name.

51,8. ἁθροίζονται: not historical present.7—

ὁ: the article is frequently used with proper nouns, especially with the names of persons well known or previously mentioned. 

λαβών: the commonest use of the circumstantial participle.8 English uses the present tense, but Greek is more accurate, the aorist participle expressing simple occurrence and usually implying the completion of the action of the participle before the time of the main verb. Cyrus had taken Tissaphernes before he started.9

51,9. ὡς φίλον: as a friend, so he said. By the use of ὡς Xenophon means to imply that Cyrus, the subject of the sentence, believed, or at least pretended to believe, that Tissaphernes was his friend, without implying that Xenophon himself held that opinion. He knew, in fact, that Tissaphernes was no friend to Cyrus, as we see from 1. 13 f. 

τῶν
Ἑλλήνων: of his Greeks, mercenaries in his service. The genitive is partitive [GenPart]. 

ἔχων: wth; a present participle expresses continuance ; cp. λαβών, l.8. The act of taking preceded the going, but the having continued. 

ὁπλίτας: see Introd. §§ 56,58. These soldiers were taken as a bodyguard.

51,10. ἀνέβη: an aorist and a historical present (ἀναβαίνει, l. 8) are often used in close connection. 

ἄρχοντα: as commander, in apposition with Ξενίαν; cp. the construction with that of σατράπην, l. 6.—
δέ: and; cp. l.7.

αὐτῶν: objective genitive [GenObj].2 

Παρράσιον: the Arcadian mountaineers were prized as mercenaries, much as the Swiss, who inhabit a similarly mountainous and isolated country, have been in demand in more modern times.

51,12. ἐτελεύτησε: sc. τὸν βίον; cp. τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου, l.3; for the translation, see on ἐποίησε, l.6. — 

εἰς: see on l.7.

51,12. ἐτελεύτησε . . . αὐτῷ: accused Cyrus to his brother of plotting against him; see Introd. § 2. 

ὡς introduces indirect discourse following the idea of saying implied in διαβάλλει, which is historical present.3 Hence the mood4 of ἐπιβουλεύοι.

51,14. τόν: like τοῦ, l.3, and τῶν, l.9, equivalent to a possessive pronoun. 

αὐτῷ: dative with a compound verb[DatVerb]. — 

ὁ δέ: and he, in Attic usually indicates a change of subject, a survival of the old use of the article as a demonstrative pronoun.

51,15. ὡς ἀποκτενῶν: future participle implying purpose,5 wth the avowed purpose of putting him to death. By using ὡς Xenophon marks this purpose as the one put forward by the king himself, and at the same

 time he disclaims all responsibility for its truth.1 See ὡς in Vocab., and cp. ὡς φίλον, l.9, and note. —
 
 ἡ: not the; cp. τόν, l. 14.

51,16. ἐξαιτησαμένη: observe the force of the preposition (out of his brother's power). The wife of a deceased king held a peculiarly powerful position in the Persian court. She ranked above the king’s chief wife, and often exercised more authority as queen mother than she had wielded as queen consort.

52,2. μήποτε: distinguish from οὕποτε.2

ἔσται: in an object clause (as distinct from a purpose clause) the future is the usual construction with ὅπως3 after a verb denoting striving or caring for.

ἐπί: with dative of person[Dat???], the power of.

52,3. δύνηται: the subjunctive is used in the protasis of both present general4 and future more vivid5 conditions. A clear distinction is always made, however, by the form of the verb used in the apodosis, or by the context. The recessive accent of δύνηται is irregular.6

μέν: correlative with 8, l.5. The measures of Parysatis are set off against those of Cyrus himself.

52,4. Κύρῳ: [DatVerb]cp. αὐτῷ, 51,14.

φιλοῦσα: circumstantial participle of cause, because she loved.7 For the tense, see on ἔχων, 51,9. See Introd. §§ 1, 5.

52,5. βασιλεύοντα: the attributive participle. 

ἀφικνεῖτο : a more usual construction here would be the optative,8 but the idea of indefiniteness denoted by that mood is sometimes felt to be sufficiently expressed by the indefinite relative ὅστις. 

τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως: of those from the king. The article, with or without a substantive, is often followed bya prepositional phrase equivalent to an attributive adjective.

52,6. βασιλέως: without the article (see Vocab.).

πάντας: owing to the distributive meaning of ὅστις, it is easy for a word referring back to it to slip into the plural. πάντας serves as object of the participle as well as of ἀπεπέμπετο. ---- 

ἀπεπέμπετο : note the force of the tense ;9 for the voice of μεταπέμπεται, 51,5 ; contrast ἀποπέμπει, 51,16.

52,7. ὥστε... εἶναι: expresses the result as tending to follow the action of οὕτω διατιθείς, with such treatment as to make them, etc. It implies, but does not definitely state, that they were actually more friendly to him. To emphasize the attainment of a result, Greek uses ὥστε with the indicative.1

αὐτῷ: depends on the adjective; the indirect reflexive αὑτῷ might have been used.2

μᾶλλον: rather (not forming a comparative with φίλους).

52,8. καί: see καί, 51,6.

τῶν βαρβάρων: genitive with a verb of caring for[GenVerb].3 We might expect ἐπεμελεῖτο ὡς οἱ παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ βάρβαροι πολεμεῖν, etc., but the substantive is transferred to the main clause and made to depend on ἐπεμελεῖτο. Any one not a Greek was styled a βάρβαρος, and even now foreigners traveling in Greece are sometimes so called. 

παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ: a prepositional phrase used attributively, like παρὰ βασιλέως, l. 6. ---- 

ὡς ... εἴησαν: an object clause depending on a past tense of a verb of caring for. The regular Attic usage would be ὅπως with the future indicative, as in l.2. ὡς instead of the more usual ὅπως in this construction is peculiar to Xenophon. See Introd. § 43, p. 33.

πολεμεῖν: depends on an adjective of ability.5

52,9. τε. .. καί: not only... but also. 

εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν: not infrequently Greek uses ἔχω intransitively with an adverb instead of εἰμί with an adjective, to hold (keep, stay) in a well-disposed condition, rather than to be well disposed. But translate in the latter way. 


τὴν: see on Τόν, 51,14.

52,10. ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο : as best (lit., most) he could.

52,11. ἐπικρυπτόμενος : circumstantial participle of manner. Note the voice.6 The whole phrase may be translated as secretly as he could. See Introd. § 6.

ὅπως . .. λάβοι: a purpose clause depending on a past tense. 

ὅτι: often used, like ὡς, to strengthen a superlative adjective or adverb; cp. Latin quam in quam plurimi, as many as possible.

52,13. ὧδε: bear in mind the difference between ὧδε and οὕτω. In this instance ὧδε includes everything to the end of the chapter. —

ἐποιεῖτο: the tense indicates that the action was prolonged over a period of time.

52,14. φυλακάς: from φύλαξ οὐ φυλακή? The antecedent is taken into the relative clause.1 Translate as if we had ὁπόσων φυλακῶν, which might have been used, of whatever garrisons he had, etc. —

παρήγγειλε: note the force of the preposition, passed the word along, sent word.

52,15. Πελοποννησίους: the Greek force of Cyrus was largely composed of Peloponnesians, at this time the best soldiers among the Greeks. See Introd. §§ 8, 53.

52,16. ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους: genitive absolute[GenAbs] of cause.2 

ὡς indicates the cause as that assigned by Cyrus, not by Xenophon; see on ὡς φίλον, 51,9, and ὡς ἀποκτενῶν, 51,15. Translate because, as he said, Tissaphernes was plotting.

52,17. πόλεσι : [DatVerb] See on αὐτῷ, 51,14.

52,18. καὶ γάρ: and in fact (γάρ being an adverb), though often it may best be rendered by for. The theory of an ellipsis (as and [thes was so] for), which could easily be supplied from the context, arose from the idea that γάρ was always a conjunction. See γάρ in Vocab. —

ἦσαν: with predicate genitive[Gen???], had belonged to (lit., used to be of ).—
Ἰωνικαί: Ionia (see map, frontispiece) contained some of the wealthiest and most populous cities in Asia Minor, among them Ephesus, Miletus, and Smyrna.

52,19. ἀφειστήκεσαν: predicate genitive of possession[???Where is the genitive in this sentence].2— 

τὸ ἀρχαῖον: adverbial accusative[AccAdv]. — 

ἐκ βασιλέως : ἐκ instead of ὑπό, which is regularly used of the agent, emphasizes the giver as the source of the gift rather than as the agent of the giving. Translate having been a gift from the king.

52,20. ἀφειστήκεσαν : the pluperfect of ἵστημι is found with or without augment.5

52,21. Μιλήτου: it was important for Tissaphernes to hold this, the chief Greek city of Asia Minor, where he had built a fortress. He had pursued a policy of banishment and execution. See Introd. § 4.

52,23. τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα: note the article.1 Where English uses a singular, indicating the whole, Greek often employs a plural, emphasizing the parts. The accusative is cognate[AccCog], forming this same plan. —

βουλευομένους: sc. τινας; the participle is supplementary in indirect discourse,2 the present tense representing the present indicative of direct discourse. 

ἀποστῆναι: in apposition with αὐτά; it may be introduced in translation by namely or that is.

52,24. τοὺς μὲν... τοὺς δ᾽: some... others; note the difference in meaning between the article with μὲν... δέ3 and the article with δέ alone; cp. 51,14. In either case the article has its original demonstrative force.

52,25. φεύγοντας: equivalent to a substantive, exiles.

συλλέξας: since there is no connective (such as καί) codrdinating this participle with ὑπολαβών, we must subordinate the latter to it, and understand that the act expressed in ὑπολαβών was previous to that of συλλέξας, having taken .. ., he collected . . . and besteged, etc.

53,1. τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας: those who had been banished; see on φεύγοντας, 52,25. ἐκπίπτω is used as a passive of ἐκβάλλω4 (cp. ἐξέβαλεν,
52,24).

αὕτη: note the breathing and accent. It agrees in gender with the predicate substantive, otherwise it would be τοῦτο. 

53,2. αὐτῷ: dat. of possessor, and in this again he had, etc. 

τοῦ ἀθροίζειν: for collecting, objective genitive[GenObj] with πρόφασις. The infinitive (as in English, Latin, and other languages) is often used as a noun; at the same time it may take an object, like a verb.

53,3. ἀδελφὸς ὢν: the ground of the demand; see on φιλοῦσα, §2, 4.


αὐτοῦ: with this use 5 of αὐτός cp. τὰ αὐτά, 52,23.

53,4. δοθῆναι, ἄρχειν: objects of a verb of asking. 

οἷ: = sibi, the indirect reflexive6 It is accented because emphatic,7 being opposed to Τισσαφέρνην. --- 

πόλεις : subject of δοθῆναι, that these cities be given.

53,5. αὐτῶν: the genitive[GenVerb] depends on the idea of ruler contained in the verb. 

αὐτῷ: [DatVerb] see on αὐτῷ, 51,14. 

ταῦτα: object of συνέπραττεν, cooperated with him in this.

53,6. ὥστε... ἠσθάνετο: see on ὥστε. .. εἶναι, 52,7. Diphthongs are augmented by lengthening their first vowel. — 

πρὸς ἑαυτόν: see on παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ, 52,8.

53,7. Τισσαφέρνει: stands first in its clause because emphatic in opposition to ἑαυτόν. The dative of association[Dat???] is regular with verbs of fighting1; σὺν Τισσαφέρνει would mean on the side of Tissaphernes.


πολεμοῦντα : see on φιλοῦσα, 52,4.

αὐτῶν πολεμούντων : at their being at war; for the construction, cp. ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους, 52,17. Since many of the Persian satraps possessed power which might be dangerous to the king if directed against him, any conflict between them that kept them busy and lessened their ability to aim at the chief power was not displeasing to Artaxerxes.

53,9. καὶ γάρ: see on 52,18. — 

ἀπέπεμπε: continued to, etc., a common use of the imperfect. — 

γιγνομένους: as they became due.

53,10. βασιλεῖ: the dative with a verb of sending denotes not so much the person to whom, as the one for whom a thing is sent (dative of interest[§DatAdvn???]), but to may be used in translation. 

πόλεων ὧν : for πόλεων ἅς. ὧν serves as object of ἔχων and is attracted into the case of its antecedent.8 — 

Τισσαφέρνους: belonging to Tissaphernes ; see on Τισσαφέρνους, 52,19.

53,11. ἐτύγχανεν ἔχων: happened to have, in consequence of the fortunes of war. For the construction, see on παρών, 51,5.

συνελέγετο: was being collected; cp. ἀπέπεμπε, l.9.

53,19. ἀπὸ. .. χρημάτων: viewed as the source whence sprang his ability to collect an army; the dative of means[§DatInstr] might have been used.

τοῖς ὑπὲρ Ἑλλήσποντον οἰκοῦσι: for the position of this attributive phrase, cp. τῇ . . Ἀβύδου, 1. 13.

53,24. Ἕλληνας: they were Greek colonists of the Chersonese and the Thracian shore of the Propontis, who, being regarded by the natives as intruders, had to wage a continual struggle to maintain their position. 

καί: even, i.e. money as well as supplies and other assistance. Great care should be exercised in the translation of καί. It is often not connective, but intensive, i.e. not a conjunction, but an adverb. —


συνεβάλλοντο: for the mood, see on ὥστε . ... εἶναι, 52,7. The tense shows that they gave not only once but repeatedly. The aorist would indicate that they gave a single lump sum. 

αὐτῷ: not dependent on the preposition of the compound verb (contributed with him, cp. αὐτῷ, l.5), but a dative of interest[§DatAdvn] implying advantage, gave him their contributions. 

εἰς: of purpose, for, towards.

53,25. τῶν στρατιωτῶν: objective genitive[GenObj]; cp. αὐτῶν, 51,10.

53,26. ἑκοῦσαι: usually best translated as an adverb; here it might be rendered and were glad to do it. 

τοῦτο... τὸ στράτευμα: observe how, in a highly inflected language like Greek or Latin, words widely separated (for emphasis or other considerations of style) are shown to belong together by agreement in gender, number, and case. In English, where inflection gives little help in determining the agreement, the order of words is more restricted. 

οὕτω: note how this differs from ὧδε, 52,13. --- 

τρεφόμενον ἐλάνθανεν: was secretly supported ; for grammar reference, see on παρών, 51,5, and observe the different way of translating the participle. 

αὐτῷ: for him, i.e. Cyrus ; see on αὐτῷ, l. 12.

54,1. ξένος: predicate nominative[NomPred].

54,2. ὑπὸ... ἀντιστασιωτῶν: the regular construction of the agent; cp. ἐκ βασιλέως, 52,19, and see note.

54,3. αὐτόν, μισθόν : double accusative[AccDoubl] with a verb of asking1; both are direct objects; cp. σατράπην, 51,6.

εἰς. .. ξένους: since Cyrus would hardly have been willing to send to such a distance as Thessaly troops which he had at hand, already assembled in Asia, it seems best to take closely with μισθόν not only τριῶν μηνῶν but also εἰς . . . ξένους, pay for 2000 mercenaries (and) for three months (cp. εἰς, 53,24) ; that is, Aristippus was to raise the forces himself with money furnished by Cyrus. Later he sent 1500 men under Menon to take part in the expedition of Cyrus; see 56,13.

54,4. μηνῶν: genitive of measure[§GenMeas].2 

ὡς... περιγενόμενος ἄν : because (expressed by the circumstantial participle of cause), as he said, he would thus, etc. For ὡς, see on ὡς ἀποκτενῶν, 51,15. The participle with ἄν 3 is equivalent to the potential optative,4 representing the apodosis of a less vivid future condition, of which the protasis (‘if he should give them to him’) is implied in οὕτως.

54,5. ἀντιστασιωτῶν : genitive of comparison[§GenComp].5 

δίδωσιν: Cyrus may have been the more willing to grant this request because Aristippus belonged to the noble family of the Aleuadae, who had been the first of the Greeks to submit to Xerxes when he invaded Greece in 480 B.c.

54,6. αὐτοῦ: the genitive[GenVerb] serves as one object of  δεῖται,6 

μὴ... καταλῦσαι Being another object; cp. “let him ask of God,” James I. 5.

54,7. μή: the regular negative with the infinitive when it is not in indirect discourse.7

πρόσθεν: anticipates the following πρίν and is not to be translated. 

καταλῦσαι πρός: to come to terms with. 

πρὶν ἂν . .. συμβουλεύσηται: πρίν takes the finite moods chiefly after negatives.8 The subjunctive9 refers vividly to the future (cp. more vivid future conditions) and expresses the thought as it existed in the mind of Cyrus when he made the request (implied indirect discourse 10) ; the aorist subjunctive expresses simple occurrence in the future, and so may

54,11. λαβόντα: circumstantial participle of time, having taken, to come; English says to take and come. 

ὅτι: see on 52,11.

ἐποιεῖτο: see on ἀπέπεμπε, 53,9. 

ὡς. . . βουλόμενος: that he wished; cp. ὡς... βουλόμενος, 1. 11.

συναλλαγέντι πρός : having become reconciled with ; cp. πρός, 54,7

ὃ εἶχε στράτευμα: what he had in the way of an army; the antecedent is taken up into the relative clause.

55,3. αὐτῷ: see on αὐτῷ, 53,12. --- 

προειστήκει: see on ἀφειστήκεσαν, 52,20. When the perfect has a present meaning, the pluperfect is equivalent to the imperfect.1

55,4. ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι: with the position of this attributive phrase cp. παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ, 52,8.

λαβόντα: agrees with the omitted subject of ἥκειν ; it might have been dative agreeing with Ξενίᾳ 2 (cp. συναλλαγέντι, l. 1, and λαβόντι, 54,23).

55,5. ὁπόσοι: with omitted antecedent τοσούτων, depending on πλήν (cp. 52,21), except as many as.

55,9. τοὺς φυγάδας : -- τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας, 53,1.

ἐστρατεύετο: he said στρατεύομαι. Such a change of tense in indirect discourse, while regular in English, is unusual in Greek.

56,3. ὡς: a preposition.5 (sc. ὁδῷ) ἐδύνατο τάχιστα: cρ. ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο, 52,10.

56,4. δή: naturally.

πλέθρα : the pupil should familiarize himself with the English equivalents of the Greek measures.

56,10. ἐζενγμένη πλοίοις: formed of boats joined together (lit., yoked by means of boats). The perfect tense expresses the completed act of joining and implies the permanence of the result. The boats had been joined and still were joined. An aorist participle would have expressed merely the fact that they had been joined.

56,12. οἰκουμένην: in contrast with the many cities deserted on account of scarcity of water, attacks from bandits, oppression by governors, etc. 

56,13. ἡμέρας: for the case, cp. σταθμούς, l.7.

Μένων: sent by Aristippus, who had not come himself in answer to the summons of Cyrus, 55,1 ff.

56,14. Δόλοπας, Αἰνιᾶνας: from the southwestern and southern parts of his own country, while the Olynthians came from Chalcidice, a district in Macedonia.

56,18. Κύρῳ: see on αὐτῷ, 53,2.

ἦν: with a neuter plural subject,! which, however, as not infrequently, has a singular meaning; cp. Lat. castra, camp.

56,19. θηρίων: genitive with an adjective of fullness (GEN???). 

ἐκεῖνος ἐθήρευεν : he used to hunt; see on ἀπεπέμπετο, 52,6. 

ἐκεῖνος (not ‘that one’) is used as a personal pronoun.

56,20. ὁπότε. .. βούλοιτο: a temporal clause depending on a verb which expresses repeated past action, so equivalent to a past general condition.2

56,21. μέσου: in the predicate position means middle of, midst of ; 3 cp. Lat. media aestate, in the middle of summer.

56,22. αὐτοῦ: the genitive of personal pronouns is always in the predicate position.4

56,23. Κελαινῶν: a poetical use, in which the genitive[Gen???] takes the place of a noun in apposition; so regularly in English, as ‘city of London,’ ‘state of Maine.<note>GRC:document this -- we do have the apposition elsewhere in Anab1, I think</note>

ἔστι: observe the accent.1— 

μεγάλον βασιλέως : the adjective is usually omitted, as with βασιλέα, l.3.

57,1. ὑπό: αἱ the foot of. The Marsyas gushes with great force from the base of a rocky cliff. The cave from which it once flowed has now fallen in. 

καὶ οὗτος: this too, as well as the Meander (56,22 f.).

57. 3. ποδῶν: predicate genitive of measure[§GenMeas].2

57,4. λέγεται Ἀπόλλων: the personal construction (Apollo is said) with the passive of verbs which take an infinitive of indirect discourse, and with some other expressions, is more frequent than the impersonal (λέγεται Ἀπόλλωνα, it is said that Apollo).3— The story ran that Athena, after inventing the flute, threw it away in disgust because she found that the act of blowing it distorted her comely features. If was discovered by Marsyas, the god of the river which rises at Celaenae. He was so delighted with his discovery and his musical ability that he had the presumption to challenge Apollo, the leader of the Muses and patron of the fine arts, who was proficient with the far more melodious lyre. The challenger, defeated, was punished for his arrogance in the manner mentioned by Xenophon. The story is given by Ovid, Metamorphoses 6. 382 ff., Hastd 6. 697 ff. 

νικήσας: expresses simple occurrence and implies that the action of the participle is past with reference to éxdeipa, after outdoing him.

57,5. ἐρίζοντα: agrees with αὐτόν, which is to be supplied as object of νικήσας.

οἱ: dative of the indirect reflexive pronoun; cp. οἷ, 53,4, and see note. For the case, see on Τισσαφέρνει, 53,7. --- 

περὶ σοφίας: in a contest of skill, in this instance evidently musical skill.

57,6. ὅθεν: with -θεν cp. -δε; see on οἴκαδε, 55,15.

αἱ πηγαί: sc. εἰσί = ῥέουσι.

57,8. τῇ μάχῃ: the (famous 4) battle of Salamis, 480 B.C.; the dative denotes time when[DatTime], like the Latin ablative.

57,10. ἡμέρας τριάκοντα : there was no other halt of such length. Cyrus was waiting for the contingents of Clearchus and others to overtake him.

58,2. Κρῆτας: Crete was famous for its archers. Nearly three hundred and fifty years later, Caesar employed them; see Gallic War 2. 7.

58,4. Σῶσις: not mentioned again. It is not known what became of him. 

58,7. Σοφαίνετος: undoubtedly a mistake, either of Xenophon or of an early copyist, for Ἀγίας. Sophaenetus has already arrived (55,24), while Agias, an Arcadian, of whose coming no mention is made, was one of the generals entrapped by Tissaphernes at the Zapatas (132, 6).

58,13. οἱ σύμπαντες: the whole body or all taken together; note the attributive position.1

58,15. πελτασταί: here equivalent to γυμνῆτες, as it includes both peltasts proper and archers. See Introd. § 57.

58,16. τοὺς δισχιλίους: the article may be used with a numeral which denotes an approximate round number. The exact figures, according to the previous accounts, were 10,600 and 2300. 

58,19. Πέλτας: see map. From Celaenae Cyrus turned to the northwest. At Ceramon Agora he struck the main highway to the east; see on διὰ τῆς Λυδίας, 56,7.

58,20. Λύκαια: cognate accusative[AccCog].2

58,21. ἀγῶνα : games were a regular part of Greek religious festivals.


ἦσαν: agrees with the predicate nominative[NomPred].3

μηνῶν: genitive of measure [§GenMeas]; cp. ποδῶν, 57,3 .

59,4. θύρας: since it applies to a camp, translate headquarters. —

ἀπήτουν: used here of asking for what was due. Observe the tense, denoting continuous or repeated demands, and cp. ἀπέπεμπε, 53,9. For augment, see on ὥστε . . . ἠσθάνετο, 53,6. --- 

ὁ δέ: see on 51,14.

59,5. λέγων διῆγε: the supplementary participle, not in indirect discourse, here defines the application of a verb which without it has only a general meaning.4 

δῆλος ἦν ἀνιώμενος: supplementary participle in indirect discourse.5 To retain in English the personal construction, translate he was evidently troubled.

ἔχοντα: the participle implies condition ;1 it agrees with the unexpressed subject of the infinitive. 

μή : see on 54,7. --- ἀποδιδόναι: for the force of ἀπο-, see on ἀπήτουν, l.4; translate not to pay his debts, if he had the money.

59,7. Συεννέσιος: used as a proper name (see Vocab.). For the position of the Cilician kings, see Κιλικία in Vocab. It will be seen from the map that the route of Cyrus lay directly through Cilicia. This fact put Syennesis in a trying position. As a dependent of the king, his clear duty was to obstruct and delay the passage of Cyrus by all possible means. Should he do so, however, and should Cyrus after all succeed in his attempt on the throne, the Cilician kingdom would be given to another. So he trimmed between the two rivals, sending one son to: Cyrus, the other to Artaxerxes. He made a pretense of resisting the advance of Cyrus, and sent the king assurances of his fidelity. To Cyrus, on the other hand, he despatched his wife with a large sum of money and the promise that any resistance to his passage through Cilicia should be only perfunctory.

59,8. Κιλίκων: article omitted, as with Midas, 54,12.

59,9. δοῦναι: cp. ἀποδιδόναι, l.6. The queen owed Cyrus nothing. The fact that the subject of δοῦναι is not expressed shows that ἐλέγετο is personal, she was said; cp. λέγεται, 57,4, and see note. 

χρήματα: it seems likely that Syennesis had promised this beforehand, for otherwise Cyrus would hardly have started on such a journey with so little money. 

δ᾽ οὖν: at any rate; a common phrase after the mention of a rumor or an uncertainty.

59,10. εἶχε: note the augment.2

59,11. αὑτήν: observe the breathing.3

59,12. ἐλέγετο: here in the impersonal construction4 (cp. l. 8), its subject being the phrase indirectly quoted. 

τῇ Κιλίσσῃ: for the case, Cp. αὐτῷ, 53. 5.

59,16. παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν: by the roadside; the accusative[Acc???] indicates that the water flowed beside the road. 

κρήνη... καλουμένη : the so-called spring of Midas.

αὐτήν: the spring. The English idiom requires by mixing wine with it.

ἐπιδεῖξαι :  see on δοθῆναι, 53,4.

59,25. στῆναι: Zo take their places. 

ἕκαστον: sc. στρατηγόν.

59,26. ἐπὶ τεττάρων: the line was usually eight deep; the present arrangement consequently made the front of the army extend over twice as much ground as usual, or about one and a half miles. 

εἶχε: see on ἦν, 55,28. 

δεξιόν: the place of honor, because in the conflict it was the post of danger. Since the shield was carried on the left arm, the soldiers on the right wing had their outer side unprotected. 

οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ :  see on τοὺς οἴκοι, 55; 2.

60,2. πρῶτον μέν: see on τὸ ἀρχαῖον, 52,19; the expression is correlative to εἶτα δέ, l.5.

60,4. τεταγμένοι: for the tense, see on ἐζευγμένη, 56,10. --- 

κατά: by, according to.

ἴλας: of cavalry; τάξεις, of infantry. The Persian τάξις regularly contained one hundred men.

60,5. Ἕλληνας : sc. ἐθεώρει.

60,7. πάντες: as with πάντας, 1. 10, only the Greek troops are meant.

60,8. χιτῶνας: usually covered by the breastplate, but on this occasion left uncovered to secure the picturesque effect of the dark red color.

60,10. ἐκκεκαλυμμένας: implies manner; note the tense and see on ἐζευγμένη, 56,10. It was the custom, as in the Roman army, when on the march, to have the shield protected by a leather covering; cp. Caesar, Gallic War 2.21, ad... scutis tegimenta détrahenda, for taking off the coverings from their shields. To relieve the hoplite on the march of some of his seventy-five pounds of equipment, the shields thus covered were sometimes piled upon the baggage wagons. For the outfit of heavy-armed soldiers, see Introd. § 58.

60,21. ἐσάλπιγξε: 6ὁ σαλπικτής is implied as subject.1

60,22. θᾶττον: faster and faster.

60,23. προϊόντων: SC. αὐτῶν, genitive absolute[GenAbs]. 

ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτομάτου : i.e. without orders from Cyrus. They caught his idea and of their own accord made this contribution to the entertainment of the queen.

60,24. δρόμος. .. στρατιώταις: the soldiers broke into a run; στρατιώταις is dative of relation or interest[§DatInstr].2

60,26. φόβος: sc. ἐγένετο.

60,27. καί: connects the following double statement, joined by τε ... καί, not only... but also, with what precedes.

60,28. οἱ ἐκ τῆς ἀγορᾶς: fhe market people, who conducted the market maintained in the barbarian army. See Introd. § 60.

61,2. τὴν λαμπρότητα: of shields and bright tunics.

61,13. διαρπάσαι: the infinitive of purpose, in Greek as in English, is often used in the active, to plunder, where logically the passive, to be plundered, is required. Here Cyrus first leaves his own satrapy and enters the country of the Lycaonians, who, besides being as predatory as the Pisidians, had seized several districts, which they continued to hold independently and in defiance of Persian authority.

61,14. ὡς... οὖσαν: see on ὡς... . βουλόμενος, 54,11.

61,15. τὴν ταχίστην ὁδόν: adverbial accusative[AccAdv]. This route was through a pass of the Taurus range, unsuited for the passage of a large army. Thus, under guise of an escort for the queen, probably with the connivance of Syennesis, Cyrus secured a foothold in Cilicia. Under these circumstances Syennesis could justify himself to Artaxerxes for coming to terms with Cyrus.

61,17. καὶ αὐτόν: and Menon himself. 

διὰ Καππαδοκίας : only its southwestern corner.

62,3. ἐν ᾧ: sc. χρόνῳ.

62. 4. ἀπέκτεινεν : the tense denotes the duration of the proceedings — arrest, trial, and execution. 

62,5. ἕτερόν τινα: another; τις is frequently used as an indefinite article. 

τῶν ὑπάρχων: partitive.

62,6. αἰτιασάμενος... αὐτῷ: accusing (see on λαβών, 51,8) them of plotting against him. Perhaps they were loyal to the king and merely refused to declare for Cyrus, but possibly also they were planning to betray Cyrus into the hands of the king. The temptation to do this must have been great. The betrayer of Cyrus would doubtless be liberally rewarded by the king, and it is a striking indication of his personal popularity that more treachery was not attempted. The infinitive is in indirect discourse.

εἰσβάλλειν : see on παραγενέσθαι, 54,11. ---- 

εἰς τὴν Κιλικίαν : the road to Babylon lay directly through this mountainous country, where the advance of Cyrus could easily have been checked. The pass, 3300 feet above sea level, is so narrow that hardly four men can walk through it abreast. It commands the entrance into Asia Minor on this side.

62,8. ἁμαξιτός, ἀμήχανος : feminine.

εἰ. . . ἐκώλυεν: a simple condition with conative imperfect,3 tried to prevent.

62,10. καί: too, i.e. in addition to the natural difficulties of the pass. Syennesis stayed there, however, only long enough to keep up appearances, and then, probably by agreement made through his wife with Cyrus, withdrew and left the strong position undefended.

62,11. τῇ δ᾽ ὑστεραίᾳ: dative of time when[DatTime].

62,12. ὅτι: commonly used to introduce indirect discourse depending on the active of λέγω.4 

λελοιπὼς εἴη: he said λέλοιπε, has left; note the periphrastic form of the optative.5

62,13. ἐπεὶ ἤσθετο: causal. The aorist indicative in subordinate clauses of direct discourse, the imperfect (see ἤκουε, 1. 14) and pluperfect in both principal and subordinate clauses, tend to remain unchanged in indirect discourse.6

62,14. ἦν: ἐστί or εἴη would be more usual ; see on ἐστρατεύετο, 55,12.


εἴσω: on the Cilician side. 

ὀρῶν: genitive with an adverb[Gen???] ; cp. Ἀβύδου, 53,13. 

ὅτι: because.

62,16. Λακεδαιμονίων: possessive genitive (§GenPos), belonging to the Spartans. See Introd. § 7. To keep the emphasis as expressed by the Greek order, translate, he kept hearing that triremes belonging to the Spartans and to Cyrus himself were sailing round from Ionia to Cilicia under the command of Tamos. See on τοῦτο. .. τὸ στράτευμα, 53,26.

62,17. οὐδενὸς κωλύοντος: without opposition; genitive absolute (GenAbs). —

σκηνάς: camp (see Vocab.) or huts, for tents would have been taken away. Probably, too, a permanent guard was kept there.

62,19. δένδρων: see on θηρίων, 56,19:

πολύ: agrees with the nearest noun.

62,21. πυρούς, κριθάς: plural because of their component grains; for a similar reason many Englishmen speak of coals for coal.

62,22. ὄρος: here used to denote a range of mountains, the Taurus (like mons Jura in Caesar, Gallic War l.6).

αὐτό: the plain.

62,25. Ταρσούς: Tarsus, later the home of St. Paul; see Acts 9. 11. The pl. Ταρσοί and Ἰσσοί (63,5) are not used by other writers.

62,27. μέσον: used as substantive.

63,1. ὄνομα, εὖρος: accusative of specification[AccResp].

οἱ ἐνοικοῦντες: the inhabitants; cp. φεύγοντας, 52,25, and see note. The substantive participle is frequently to be rendered by a relative clause, those who, etc.; as οἱ . . . ἔχοντες, l.3 f.

63,5. Σόλοις: originally a Greek colony, and hence it had nothing to fear. 

Ἰσσοῖς: near the scene of Alexander’s great battle with the Persians in 333 B.c. The inhabitants of these two towns remained to trade with the fleet and army. Such plurals as these and Ταρσούς (62,25) are thought to be the name of the inhabitants applied to the city.

63,6. προτέρα: adjective equivalent to an English adverb; see on ἑκοῦσαι, 53,26.

Κύρου: genitive of comparison[§GenComp] with προτέρα.1

63,7. ἡμέραις: dative of degree of difference[DatMeas].2

63,8. λόχοι: the λόχος consisted normally of one hundred men (Introd. § 56), but it seems here that the two missing λόχοι together contained only that number (see l. 12). Perhaps the λόχοι were not full, or possibly ἕκαστος should be read before ἑκατόν, one hundred each.

63,9. οἱ μὲν... οἱ δέ: see on 52,24. 


ἁρπάζοντάς τι: circumstantial participle of time and cognate accusative[AccCog], while engaged in some act of depredation.

τε: correlative with καί, l. 15.

63,14. διήρπασαν: an act not authorized by Cyrus and probably discontinued on his arrival.

63,16. μετεπέμπετο : the tense denotes repetition.

63,17. πρὸς ἑαυτόν: to his presence. 

οὔτε... ἔφη: the οὐ of οὔτε, though grammatically belonging with ἔφη, goes in sense with the infinitive, said that he had not before up to this time come, etc.; cp. the use of Lat. nego, as negat sé... posse, he says that he cannot, Caesar, Gallic War 1.8. Translate οὔτε... , etc., he said that he had not... and he did not wish either. ἤθελε is in the same construction as ἔφη.

63,18. πρότερον: superfluous with πω. 

οὐδενί: being a compound negative, it does not make an affirmative with οὔτε, but strengthens the negation.4 Translate the dative[DatPoss] 5 as a possessive genitive[§GenPos], of anybody, with εἰς χεῖρας.

63,21. ἔπεισε: for a finite mood with πρίν, see on πρὶν ἂν . . . συμβουλεύσηται, 54,7; the indicative is used of a definite past act.

63,22. ἔλαβε: the context makes it clear that Syennesis is the subject. If there were room for doubt, the new subject would be expressed.

63,25. παρὰ βασιλεῖ: at court; see on βασιλέως, 52,6. :

63,27. χρυσοῦν (with ἀκινάκην): gold-mounted. The first three presents mentioned here could be given only by the king (see Cyropaedia 8. 2. 8). Cyrus was thus playing the king already. 

στολὴν
Περσικήν: probably the κάνδυς, a long silk robe with sleeves. See Fig. 2, p. 18.

64,1. διαρπάζεσθαι : in the same construction as the preceding accusatives (cp. δοθῆναι, 53,4), and the assurance that his country should not again be plundered. He had in mind the looting of Tarsus. 

ἣν . . . ἐντυγχάνωσιν: more vivid future condition1 in indirect discourse ; plural because it refers to Syennesis and any or all of his followers. Cyrus said ἤν που ἐντυγχάνητε, and the subjunctive is retained.

64,2. ἀπολαμβάνειν: forms the apodosis of the condition; in the same construction as διαρπάζεσθαι, l.1, the right to take back. Cyrus favors the Greeks in not giving strict orders that the booty be returned at once.

64,4. CHAPTER 3. οὐκ ἔφασαν: see on οὔτε . . . ἔφη, 63,17. --ἱέναι: with future meaning in indirect discourse (see Vocab., and cp. Eng. “I am going,” “are you going?” etc., which refer to the future more often than to the present). In l.7 and in προϊέναι, l. 9, the infinitive is not in indirect discourse, and so has no idea of time; see on wapayeveoa, 54,11. 

τοῦ πρόσω: genitive of place[GenLoc].2

64,5. ὑπώπτενον: their suspicions were now brought to a head, because to reach Pisidia from Tarsus they would have to retrace their steps and march west. — ἰέναι, μισθωθῆναι: observe that, unlike the usage of Latin, the subject of an infinitive in indirect discourse is omitted if it is the same as the subject of the principal verb.

64,9. μικρόν, ὕστερον: adverbial accusatives[AccAdv].

τὰ... ἄλλα: cognate accusative[AccCog]. English would give the particular example before the more general statement. To preserve the order of the thought we may translate not only in other ways, but also, etc.

64,18. εἰς τὸ ἴδιον... ἐμοί: for my private use; for the dative[§DatInstr], see on οὐδενί, 63,18.

64,20. ἐτιμωρούμην : 56. αὐτούς, 24. the Thracians. The tense points to the various acts of this vengeance.

ἀνθ᾽ ὧν εὖ ἔπαθον: the full form would be ἀντὶ
τούτων ἃ εὖ ἔπαθον ; the antecedent is omitted, while the relative, as often in English, is attached to the preposition and attracted to the case of the omitted word; in return for the benefits which I had received from him. 

64,25. ὑπ᾽ ἐκείνου : εὖ ἔπαθον, as passive of εὖ ἐποίησα,1 takes the genitive of agent[Gen???]. 

ἐπεί : causal. 

ὑμεῖς: emphatic by contrast with ἐμοί, 1. 15, and expressed only for that reason.

65,1. ἀνάγκη: sc. ἐστί. 

προδόντα: goes in sense with μοι, but agrees with the omitted subject of the infinitive; see on λαβόντα, 55,4.

ἐμοί: indirect object of a verb of obeying.

65,8. σὺν... ἕψομαι: well accompany.

65,10. ἄν: not with οἶμαι, —for it is never found with the present indicative, — but with εἶναι, expressing in indirect discourse the apodosis of a less vivid future condition, of which σὺν ὑμῖν represents the protasis. The ἄν of the direct discourse is retained.5

ὑμῶν: genitive of separation[GenSep].

65,11. ὦν: that the participle implies condition is shown by the ἄν of the following clause. The complete condition in direct discourse would be εἰ εἴην ἔρημος, οὐκ ἂν ἱκανὸς εἴην. 

ἂν. .. εἶναι: as in l. 10. Note the repetition of ἄν2 after οὔτ᾽... οὔτ᾽; it still belongs with εἶναι.

ὡς: introduces the genitive absolute[GenAbs], which takes the place of a participle in indirect discourse after οὕτω τὴν γνώμην ἔχετε (equivalent ἰο γιγνώσκετε τοῦτο), make up your minds to this, that, etc. (lit., in the belief (as) that, etc., so make up your minds).

θαρρεῖν: the infinitive is used with λέγω and εἶπον, when they signify tell or bid.

The infinitive is the object of δοκεῖ and in indirect discourse (hence the negatives οὐχ, οὐδέ; see on μή, 54,7)With δοκεῖ meaning it seems best an infinitive is the Subject and not in indirect discourse.

φιλία: predigate adjective,2 implying that the country would be hostile to them unless they were seen to be under the protection of Cyrus. Translate shrough his country, which would thus become friendly.

67,6. μηδέ: not .. . either. 

τὴν ταχίστην: adverbial accusative[AccAdv] ; cp.
61,15.

67,7. προκαταληψομένους (sc. ἄνδρας 45 object of πέμπειν) : denotes purpose. 

ἄκρα: of Mt. Taurus, through which they had entered Cilicia. 

ὅπως μὴ φθάσωσι: purose3; but cp. ὅπως. .. μενοῦμεν, 66,13.

67,8. καταλαβόντες: supplementary participle with φθάσωσι; see on παρών, 51,5.

67,9. ὧν... χρήματα: many of whose men and much of whose property; ὧν is partitive genitive[GenPart] with πολλούς, but possessive genitive[§GenPos] with χρήματα. --- ἔχομεν : with a participle ἔχω is not a mere auxiliary like English ‘have,’ but keeps its full force4; we have in our possession, having gained them by plunder. If Syennesis made any search for his kidnapped Cilicians (64,2), it had evidently not been very successful.

67. 11. τοσοῦτον : (only) so much, merely, an allusion to Laconian brevity. This word ordinarily refers to what precedes. 

ὡς... στρατηγήσοντα: a circumstantial participle with ὡς is sometimes equivalent to a participle in indirect discourse,5 let none of you mention me as (i.e. say that I am) the one who is to hold this command.

μηδείς... λεγέτω: see on μὴ θαυμάζετε, 64,14.

67,13. ἐμοί: the so-called dative of agent[DatAgent]1—really a form of the dative of interest[§DatInstr], denoting the one upon whom rests the necessity of doing the act.

67,14. ποιητέον: sc. ἐστί and see on σκεπτέον, 66,12; it is impossible to determine whether we have here the personal or the impersonal construction. — 

ὡς: sc. λέγετε from λεγέτω; but say rather that. —

ἀνδρὶ... πείσομαι: the dative[DatVerb] is used of the one for whom a person persuades himself, i.e. the one whom he obeys2; cp. ἐπίστευον γὰρ
αὐτῷ, 55,16. --- 

ὃν ἂν ἕλησθε: see on ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ, 65,4. --- 

ἦ δυνατὸν
μάλιστα: sc. ἐστίν, fo the best of my ability.

67,15. ἄρχεσθαι: passive.

67,16. ὥς τις, etc.: as well as anybody else in the world; 

μάλιστα ἀνθρώπων belongs with ἄρχεσθαι ἐπίσταμαι, and while it is of course superfluous after ὥς τις καὶ ἄλλος, yet it adds emphasis. ἀνθρώπων is partitive with the superlative. καὶ is not translatable.

67,17. ἐπιδεικνύς :  see on ἐπιδεικνύντες, 66,24.

67,18. αἰτεῖν: object infinitive with κελεύοντος ; sc. αὐτούς as direct object of κελεύοντος. — 

ὥσπερ... Κύρον ποιουμένον: genitive absolute[GenAbs] with ὥσπερ; just as if Cyrus were making the journey back home again.

67,19. εἴη: impersonal, the subject being αἰτεῖν; indirectly quoted, but the construction changes at once to direct discourse.

67,20. παρὰ τούτου: for a different construction of the person depending on αἰτεῖν, see l. 5.

ᾧ: dative of interest[§DatAdvn] implying disadvantage ; cp. οὐδενί, 63,18, and see note. —

ᾧ .. . πιστεύσομεν : not expressing a future condition, but a present intention4 of doing something in the future; if we are thinking of trusting, if we are going to trust.

67,21. ἡγεμόνι: See on αὐτῷ, 55,16.— 

τί... προκαταλαβεῖν: intensely ironical, amounting to ‘If we make such senseless and unreasonable requests of Cyrus, why not ask him to obviate all the difficulties of our return ?’ Sc. ἡμᾶς as direct object of κωλύει.

67,23. ὀκνοίην. .. ἄν: potential optative,1 the apodosis of a less vivid future condition, the protasis of which is implied in the following conditional relative clause, ἃ ἡμῖν δοίη (i.e. ‘if he should give us any’).2

67,24. μὴ . .. καταδύσῃ: from fear that, etc., subjunctive after ὀκνοίην, a verb implying fear; see on δίκην ἐπιθῇ, 66,9. --- 

ταῖς τριήρεσι: dative of instrument[§DatInstr]. — 

τῷ ἡγεμόνι: indirect object of ἕπεσθαι.

67,25. ὅθεν: to a place from which, the indefinite antecedent of the relative adverb being omitted. — 

οὐκ ἔσται: it will not be possible; ἔστι means be possible when it is used impersonally with an infinitive as subject.

67,26. ἄκοντος. .. Κύρου: ἄκων is used regularly without ὤν. —

ἀπιών: circumstantial participle of condition. 

λαθεῖν... ἀπελθών: to get away without his knowing it; see on τρεφόμενον ἐλάνθανεν, 53,26. The aorist participle expresses simple occurrence; αὐτόν is the object of λαθεῖν.

68,1. δοκεῖ μοι: I move; the infinitive clauses in ll. 2-12 are subjects of δοκεῖ; ἄνδρας is subject of ἐρωτᾶν.

68,2. οἵτινες ἐπιτήδειοι : sc. εἰσί.

68,3. τί: cognate accusative[AccCog], what use he wishes to make of us.—

ἡμῖν : see on φιλίᾳ, δ5, 2.

68,4. ὥσπερ: for the force of -περ, see on οὕτως. .. ὥσπερ, 66,2: just like that for which; the relative is attracted to the case of the omitted antecedent.— 

καὶ πρόσθεν: omit καί in translation. When Cyrus responded to his father’s summons (51,8), he took with him a band of Greek mercenaries, whose high pay for this unusual journey, though they had gone merely as an escort and with practically no peril, furnished a precedent for later demands.

68,5. ἡμᾶς: subject of ἕπεσθαι: and εἶναι, which in turn are subjects of δοκεῖ and with it serve as apodoses of the more vivid future condition.

κακίους: accusative[Acc???]; cp. πλείους, 65,17.

68,6. τῶν... συναναβάντων: for the genitive, cp. Κύρου, 63,6[§GenComp]. —

τούτῳ: with him; cp. πλείους, 53,5.

68,9. ἀφιέναι: distinguish from amévar; sc. ἡμᾶς as object. --- ἑπόμένοι, ἀπιόντες : serve as protases to the following optatives, hence are equivalent to εἰ and the optative in less vivid future conditions.

68,10. φίλοι: agreeing as predicate adjective with the. subject of ἑποίμεθα.

68,11. ἀπαγγεῖλαι δεῦρο: that they report here; the subject is still ἄνδρας, l. 2.

68,13. ἔδοξε ταῦτα: this was resolved upon; cp. τὰ δόξαντα, l. 14, the questions resolved upon.

68,14. στρατιᾷ: see on αὐτῷ, 54,19, but to be rendered by the army.

68,15. dἀκούει : Cyrus said ἀκούω, using present for perfect, as in English ‘I hear you have been away’ for ‘I have heard,’ etc. 

ἐχθρόν: here an adjective (cp. 66,17). An attack on Abrocdmas as a personal enemy would not be equivalent to a declaration of war against Artaxerxes. For the royal policy in such matters, see on αὐτῶν πολεμούντων, 53,8.

68,16. εἶναι : for a different construction with dxovw, see ἔχοντα,
62,15.

ἀπέχοντα: refers to Abrocomas. On this plea Cyrus succeeded in luring the Greeks nineteen stages farther before he declared his real intention.

68,17. κἄν: crasis for καὶ ἐάν.1

68,18. τὴν δίκην: δίκη regularly appears in this phrase without the article, as in 66,9; here the proper punishment, the punishment he deserved.

68,19. φύγῃ : equivalent to the Latin future perfect, Aas (shall have) fied; see on πρὶν ἂν... συμβουλεύσηται, 54,7. --- ἡμεῖς, etc.. : as is intimated in l. 21, the answer was not fully satisfactory, but the soldiers decided that the difficulties of advance were less than those of retreat.

68,20. αἱρετοί: the ἄνδρας of l.2.

68,21. τοῖς δέ: dative of possessor[DatPoss]; see on ὁ δέ, 51,14.

ὅτι ἄγει: indirect discourse, the verb keeping the form which it had in the direct discourse (He is leading); English requires a past tense (he was leading) when the main verb is past.

68,22. προσαιτοῦσι: in translation, combine the force of προσ- with the noun rather than with the verb, asked for more pay.

68,23. πᾶσι: we might expect ἑκάστῳ. --- 

δώσειν: the usual tense after a verb of promising, as in Latin. 

οὗ: as object of ἔφερον the relative would naturally be accusative, but it is attracted to the case of its omitted antecedent, which is genitive depending on the idea of comparison[§GenComp] in ἡμιόλιον. Cp. ἀνθ᾽ ὧν, 64,24, and see note.

68,24. ἔφερον: drew; lit., carried from the paymaster’s tent. See Introd. § §5.

τοῦ μηνός: time within which.1 Note here, and in τῷ, l. 25, the distributive force of the article = a or each; cp. English two cents a mile and, less commonly, a dollar the volume.

68,25. οὐδὲ. . . οὐδείς: a compound negative following another negative strengthens it.2

68,26. ἐν τῷ γε φανερῷ: intimates that some knew well enough what was on foot.

CHAPTER 4. 

69,4. στάδιον: in the plural this word is either neuter or masculine.3

69,7. οἰκουμένην: situated.

69,8. Κύρῳ παρῆσαν: see on παρῆσαν εἰς Σάρδεις, 55,17; Κύρῳ is dative of interest[§DatAdvn] implying advantage.

69,9. ἐπ᾽ αὐταῖς: in command of them.

69,11. Λακεδαιμόνιος : for Sparta’s services to Cyrus in this campaign, see Introd. § 7.

69,12. αὐταῖς : cp. Κύρῳ, l.8; was conducting them (acting as guide for them).

69,15. αἷς: dative of instrument[§DatInstr].

69,16. ἐπολιόρκει: had been besieging; see on ἐφύλαττον, 62,18, where, as here, the imperfect denotes the continuance, and the context implies the completion, of a past action. See Introd. § 4.

69,18. ἐπί: on board; ἐπί to denote mere position on regularly takes the genitive[§GenPos]; cp. ἐπ᾽ αὐταῖς, l.9.

69: 19. μετάπεμπτος : verbal adjective used for a perfect passive participle,4 and so taking the genitive of agent[Gen???].

69,20. ὧν: with a verb of ruling.5

ἐστρατήγει: he remained in command; observe the tense.

παρὰ Κύρῳ:. under Cyrus, who, of course, held supreme command of all the forces engaged in the expedition.

69,21. ᾿Ἁβροκόμα: a Doric form.1 The genitive[Gen???] is used rather than the dative[Dat???] because of the influence of ἀποστάντες. This was the last addition to the Greek force of Cyrus. See Introd. § 8.

69,25. πύλας: the article is omitted because the word is practically a proper name; cp. βασιλέως, 52,6. This pass is south of Issus, between the Amanus range and the sea. It was fortified by two walls.
-- ἦσαν δὲ ταῦτα : Xenophon violates more often than any other Attic writer the rule that a neuter plural subject takes a singular verb.2 ταῦτα agrees with the predicate substantive τείχη; cp. αὕτη, 53,1.

70,1. τὸ μὲν ἔσωθεν: sc. τεῖχος, defined further by the appositive phrase τὸ πρὸ τῆς Κιλικῶς. 

πρό: on the side of.

70,2. εἶχε: agrees with the nearer subject (cp. 7, 55,28), καὶ. ..
φυλακή being added as an afterthought. Syennesis doubtless thought that he must keep up the appearance of defense in the eyes of Abrocomas, the king’s general (1. 13), who, however, was no more sturdy a defender than Syennesis. In fact, the fleet rendered the pass untenable.

70,3. φυλακή: subject of ἐλέγετο. 

διὰ μέσου: detween.

70,4. πλέθρου: predicate genitive of measure[§GenMeas]; cp. πλέθρων, 63,1.

70,5. ἦσαν : agrees with the predicate nominative[NomPred] instead of with its subject.3 

στάδιοι: see on στάδιον, 69,4.

70,6. καθήκοντα: subject of ἦν; see on οὐκ ἔσται, 67,25.

70,7. καθήκοντα: used, like στενή, as a predicate adjective with ἦν; lit., down-reaching. Translate as a verb, extended down (καθῆκε).

70,8. ἀμφοτέροις : see on ἀμφοτέρω, 51,4.

70,9. πύλαι: here in its usual meaning, gates; cp. 69,25. 

παρόδου: genitive[Gen???] with ἕνεκα.

70,10. μετεπέμψατο: translate as pluperfect, for it probably refers to the summoning of the fleet from Ephesus. Cyrus had foreseen the possibility of a blockade at the pass, and had prepared to overcome it.

εἴσω καὶ ἔξω: both between the two walls and on the Syrian side, so as to take the Persian in front and rear.

70,1 βιασομένους : to overpower; for the tense, see on ἀποκτενῶν,
51,15.


εἰ φυλάττοιεν: more vivid future condition in implied indirect discourse after a past tense μετεπέμψατο, representing ἐὰν φυλάττωσι, the thought of Cyrus when he sent for the ships. For a similar change

70,15. ὄντα : cp. εἶναι, 68,16. 

Φοινίκης: the satrapy of Abrocdmas.

ἦν: imperfect of the time described; the present might have been used.

70,21. αὐτόθι: note the force of the suffix.2

70,22. Ξενίας: cp. 51,10.

70,23. τὰ πλείστου ἄξια: their most valuable possessions; for the genitive, see on πολλοῦ, 66,16[GenVal]. 

70,24. ὧς μὲν. .. ἐδόκουν: parenthetical; translate impersonally (see on δοκεῖ, 66,10), as it seemed; μέν implies that some held another view (δέ), which is not mentioned. The reason may well have been simply that Xenias, who had previously made the journey (51,10), knew the dangerous nature of the enterprise. 

τοῖς πλείστοις: most of them.

70,25. φιλοτιμηθέντες : causal, and itself followed by causal ὅτι. —

στρατιώτας: object of ἔχειν, 71,1.

70,26. ἀπελθόντας : of the fact, see 65,16 ff. 

ὡς ἀπιόντας: supposing (see on ὡς φίλον, 51,9) that they were to go back.

70,27. οὐ πρὸς βασιλέα: sc. ἰόντας from the preceding ἀπιόντας, but it may be omitted from the translation as well as from the Greek. —

εἴα: continued to allow, or, transferring to ἔχειν the idea of continuance, allowed to keep. It would have been difficult to induce soldiers to return to a commander whom they had offended by desertion to another. For the independent spirit of the Greek soldiers, see Introd. § 68.

71,1. ὅτι διώκει: was pursuing, not, of course, in person; see on ὅτι ἄγει, 68,21.

71,2. τριήρεσι: dative of means[§DatInstr]. 

ηὔχοντο, ῴκτιρον : the tense indicates the repeated expression of such sentiments; for the augment, see on ὥστε... ἠσθάνετο, 53,6. 

ὡς . .. ὄντας : because, as they said, they were cowards; ὡς shows that the reason implied in the causal participle is that given by οἱ μέν; see on ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος, 52,16.

71,5. ἀλλ᾽ εὖ γε μέντοι ἐπιστάσθων : 4 but let them nevertheless know full well.

71,6. οὔτε: correlative with οὔτε, l.7, the intervening clause being parenthetical.

71,9. ἕως... παρῇ: equivalent to a present general condition.7

71,10. χρῶμαι : sc. αὐτῷ, see on φιλίᾳ, 65,2. 

ἐπειδὰν... βούληται: see on l. 9.

71,11. αὐτούς: after τις we might expect the singular (which is required in translation), but the statement is made more general by the plural (see on πάντας, 52,6); cp. such incorrect English as ‘ Whoever approves of this, let them raise their hands.’ κακῶς takes the place of the accusative of the thing (κακά);8 avrovs is also an object of ἀποσυλῶ.9

71,12. ἴτωσαν: imperative. 

κακίους: predicate nominative[NomPred]. —

πρός: wth regard to.

71,18. ἀκούοντες: the participle of the imperfect,2 upon hearing (repeatedly) of. By his magnanimity on this occasion Cyrus gained much and lost little or nothing. The troops of the deserting generals remained, and Cyrus may well have considered it a gain that they were henceforth to be under Clearchus, the most efficient and experienced of his generals.

72,4. πραέων : this adjective has two stems.3

72,5. θεούς: predicate accusative[Acc???]. There was a legend that in shame for the loss of her chastity, the Syrian goddess Dercéto had thrown herself into the Chalus and had there been changed to a fish. The Chaldaeans and other Orientals worshiped fish gods. Dagon, the god of the Philistines, who was believed by them to have delivered Samson into their hands (Judges 16. 23), was represented with his lower part in the form of a fish.

72,8. εἰς ζώνην: for girdle money, cp. English ‘pin money.’ Girdles were made very expensive, decorated with jewels and other ornaments. It was a Persian custom to meet the personal expenses of royal personages or their favorites by grants to be raised by certain towns. So Artaxerxes had assigned to Themistocles Lampsacus, Magnesia, and Myus, to supply him respectively with wine, bread, and other provisions. See Plato, Alcibiades I, 123 B, “Why, I have been informed

Cyrus had enticed the Greeks to a point whence they could not retreat without his aid and he was now ready to throw off the mask. Undoubtedly their indignation would have been far greater had they not before this more than suspected that they were bound for Babylon (68,21). They had perhaps already made up their minds to follow Cyrus against the king if they should succeed in securing a largess, and their anger may have been more or less feigned to induce their generals to aid them in this.

πέντε
ἀργυρίον μνᾶς: about $112, if, as is likely, not the Attic, but the heavier Persian mina is meant. Note the genitive of material[§GenMat].

73,11. ἐπὰν. ... ἥκωσι: a temporal clause referring vividly to the future, and so equivalent to a more vivid future condition; cp.  ὅ τι ἂν δέῃ, 65,4. The mood of direct discourse is retained. Since the present indicative of ἥκω is equivalent to a perfect (cp. οἴχονται, 71,7, and note), the present subjunctive, with its added idea of futurity, has the force of a future perfect. 

τὸν μισθόν: the pay agreed upon (68,23 f.).

73,12. ἐντελῆ: predicate; the largess is not to be deducted. 

μέχρι ἂν καταστήσῃ: a temporal clause referring vividly to the future, and retaining the mood of direct discourse.1 See Introd. § 11 and footnote.

73,13. τὸ... πολύ: the greater part. 

τοῦ Ἑλληνικοῦ: sc. στρατεύματος, partitive genitive[GenPart].

73,14. δῆλον: predicate; the indirect question is the subject of the infinitive. 

εἶναι: the infinitive is the regular construction with πρίν in Attic prose if the main verb is affirmative.2— 

τί ποιήσουσιν: both the interrogative (cp. ὅ τι χρή, 66,11, and see note) and the mood of the direct discourse are retained. 

οἱ ἄλλοι: the soldiers of the other generals.

οὔτε κινδυνεύσαντες οὔτε πονήσαντες: without danger or toil.

73,18. τῶν ἄλλων... στρατιωτῶν: genitive depending on the idea of comparison[§GenComp] in προτιμήσεσθε ;5 

πλέον is pleonastic, but adds emphasis.

He had been well known to the Greeks as a generous prince since his services to Lysander in the closing years of the Peloponnesian war (see Introd. § 7; cp. § 5). Κῦρον is predicate accusative[Acc???]; μηκέτι is to be taken with νομίζετε, not with the infinitive, in which case it would be οὐκέτι.6

 ship and such greed for individual gain at a time when concerted action was essential were quite in accord with Menon’s selfish character. —
ἐλέγετο : personal construction, as is shown by the lack of a subject for πέμψαι. 
74,14. τὸ ἄλλο στράτευμα: (the Greek contingent, except Menon’s troops, which had already crossed (l. 6).

74,15. τῶν διαβαινόντων: partitive.

74,16. μαστῶν: translate by the singular. 

ὑπὸ τοῦ ποταμοῦ : the use of the agent construction personifies the river; otherwise the dative of means[§DatInstr] would be used.

74,20. ἵνα. .. διαβῇ: the mood of A.'s actual thought is retained after a past tense, where we might have the optative.1 English requires might (not may) cross.—

θεῖον: predicate, a special providence, the implied subject being the low water. A second subject of ἐδόκει is ὑποχωρῆσαι τὸν ποταμόν, and that the river, etc. (see on δοκεῖ, 66,10).

74,21. Κύρῳ ὡς βασιλεύσοντι : dative of interest[§DatAdvn], in honor of Cyrus, because he was destined to be king; ws shows that the idea expressed by the participle was held by the river or by the god who controlled its waters. The statement of the Thapsacenes, as reported by Xenophon, must be regarded as a piece of Oriental flattery, since in the late autumn and early winter the river is often fordable. It is to be remembered, however, that the Greeks crossed between the middle and the end of July, at a time when the river is usually at flood height. From the end of May until towards the middle of July the waters stand about thirteen feet above low water (<bibl n="https://archive.org/details/historyofbabylon01rogeuoft/page/274/mode/2up">Rogers, History of Babylonia and Assyria, I, 274</bibl>). The conduct of Abrocomas, content with burning the boats, although it is likely that when he was there the river was already fordable, since he was not many days ahead of Cyrus, is an indication that he, like Syennesis, was trimming between the rival brothers.

74,27. ἐπεσιτίσαντο: they were entering upon the Arabian desert.

75,2. σταθμούς, εἴς. : making longer marches than usual (see Introd.
§ 64), for in the desert there were no supplies or suitable camping places.

75,4. πεδίον: predicate; ἅπαν (where we might expect ἅπασα) is attracted to the gender of the predicate substantive; see on αὕτη, 53,1.


ὁμαλές: it was really like rolling prairie, but very flat compared with the mountainous scenery common in Greece.

πλεθριαῖον: equivalent to ὄντα. .. πλέθρου, 72,2

ὄνομα δ᾽ αὐτῇ: sc. ἦν, its name was.

76,17. Μάσκα: for the form, see on Ἀβροκόμα, 69,21. The use of ὑπό personifies the river; see on 74,16. The town was on an island formed by the Mascas and the Euphrates, not by the Mascas alone.

77,21. ἔτνχεν... ἑστηκώς : see on παρὼν ἐτύγχανε, 51,5; 4150 Οἢ

78,2. ὁδόν: accusative of extent[AccSpac].

78,3. ὅσῳ... τοσούτῳ, etc.: the quicker ... the more unprepared (lit., by how much quicker... by so much the more unprepared) ; for the dative[DatMeas], see on ἡμέραις, 63,7.

βασιλεῖ: for the case, see on Τισσαφέρνει, 53,7.

78,5. συναγείρεσθαι: for συναγείρεται of Cyrus’ actual thought, the present being used because the army was already collecting. The future completion of the act was in his mind, though not expressed ; the greater (would be) the army that was collecting for the king.

78,6. συνιδεῖν. . . οὖσα: tt was possible for3 one who closely observed the king's realm to see at a glance that it ts strong, etc. After ovvidety (which is subject of impersonal ἦν) the grammatical construction would require ἰσχυρὰν οὖσαν (sc. τὴν ἀρχήν). Possibly Xenophon was interrupted in the middle of the sentence, and when he wrote ἰσχυρὰ οὖσα. he was under the impression that something like δήλη ἣν
ἡ ἀρχή had gone before. 

78,7. πλήθει: dative of respect[DatResp]. English requires two words, extent with χώρας, number with ἀνθρώπων.

τῆς κάρφης: partitive genitive[GenPart] with a verb of touching.2

78,21. ἀπὸ τοῦ φοίνικος: the preposition need not have been used ; it gives the idea of source. The expression defines βαλάνου, which is a word of indefinite meaning (see Vocab.). The Greeks had no specific word for date. The Arabs still make a drink from the juice of dates.

80,1. λέγοι: optative of implied indirect discourse, quoting the reason of the angry man 2; cp. the subjunctive with quod causal in Latin, which is likewise in implied indirect discourse. 

αὑτοῦ: indirect reflexive, referring to the subject of ἐχαλέπαινεν, not of λέγοι.

80,2. ἐν τούτῳ: 56. τῷ χρόνῳ, at this moment.

κατακεκόψεσθαι: represents the suddenness and the certainty of the act, ‘the moment you do it, I shall be (have been) cut to pieces’; i.e. that act will be so sudden that they will see, not its performance, but only its result.4 

ἐμοῦ: see on Κύρου, 63,6.

80,10. κακῶς... ἐχόντων: see on εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν, 52,9; the genitive absolute[GenAbs] implies condition. 

οὗτοι, etc.: Cyrus knew that if he should receive a fatal setback, the barbarians in his army would at once try to curry favor with the king by killing both the invading general and their hereditary enemies, the Greeks.

81,10. ἑπτά: in apposition with ἀρίστους, seven in number. Seven was a sacred number with the Persians as with the Jews; the king had a sort of cabinet of seven nobles; see Ezra 7. 14, Esther 1. 14 (cp. I. 10).

81,12. τούτους: the last mentioned. — 

θέσθαι τὰ ὅπλα: cp. 79,28.

81,13. τρισχιλίους: nearly a fourth of the Greek army. As this was important business and Orontas doubtless had much influence, Cyrus did not dare to trust his native troops.

81,15. ὅς γε: for he; ye emphasizes os, but is best rendered onlv by emphasis on he. The relative clause explains why Clearchus, alone of the Greeks, was invited to the trial.

ἀπήγγειλε. .. κρίσιν: the English idiom requires the translation of κρίσιν (proleptic or anticipatory accusative[Acc???] *) as if it were the subject of ἐγένετο, how the trial was conducted; for the actual construction, cp. “I know thee who thou art,” Luke 4. 34.

λόγου: the discussion; for the genitive, see on τοῦ διαβαίνειν, 73,24.

λόγου: in a purpose clause, hence (aorist) subjunctive. For the future indicative with ὅπως, see on ἔσται, 52,2.

81,24. ὡς ἔφη αὐτός: refers to ταχθεὶς . .. ὑπὸ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ. Cyrus suspects that this statement is not quite true, but that, on the death of Darius, Orontas, military commander of Sardis, seized the citadel without orders, to curry favor with the new king and hold his rival Cyrus in check. αὐτός is intensive, agreeing with the subject of ἔφη, he himself

81,26. αὐτόν: object of ἐποίησα, I made him so (humble) that it seemed best to him; for the translation of the infinitive ὥστε wore, see on ἐκπεπλῆχθαι, 79,24.

81,27. πολέμου: genitive of separation[GenSep]. — 

δεξιάν: a binding pledge to a Persian.

82,1. peta ratra: summing up the preceding clauses, which are introduced by ézret, 81,23. With these words, Cyrus abruptly turns to Orontas.
-- ἔστιν ὅ τι: is there anything in which? ὅ τι is cognate accusative[AccCog].
éorw denotes existence; cp. its meaning in 76,10, and see note.

82,2. ὅτι οὔ: Wo; direct discourse is frequently introduced in Greek by ὅτι, which should be omitted in translation. For accent of οὔ, cp.
73,15, and see note. 

82,3. ἠρώτα: went on asking; cp. ἠρώτησεν, l. 15.— 

Οὐκοῦν: shows that an affirmative reply is expected.2

82,4. οὐδέν: cognate accusative[AccCog], like ὅ τι, l.1. — 

ἀδικούμενος: note the tense, although suffering no wrong.

82,5. ὅ τι: object of implied ποιεῖν and referring to κακόν implied in κακῶς; translate 72 whatever way you could. — 

ἐδύνω: second person singular of the imperfect.2 — 

ἔφη: said (so), said yes.

82,6. ἔγνως: you had learned; see on ἐποίησε, 51,6.

82,7. δύναμιν: 2.6. its inadequacy, the limits of your power (Dakyns). The word is used ironically. —

82,12. οὐδὲν ἀδικηθείς : 55. ἐπιβουλεύων αὐτῷ φανερὸς γέγονε, but translate merely he had not been wronged at all. 

82,13. ἄδικος: for the nominative, see on τίμιος, 65,10. Observe how the idea of repeated offense is emphasized. Theoretically, no Persian might be put to death for a single crime; his whole life had to be considered and a balance struck between his good and his evil deeds.

82,14. ἦ γὰρ ἀνάγκη: sc. ἐστίν, really, there's nothing else to do (lit., it 7s, in fact, certainly necessary).

82,15. ἂν γένοιο: potential optative, with the implied protasis “if I should pardon you.” ,

82,17. ὅτι: see on ὅτι οὔ, l.2.

σοί. .. δόξαιμι: should I ever  again seem so, at least to you. Orontas had at least been consistently faithful to the king, to whom his allegiance primarily belonged, and it is possible that the agreements which he had failed to keep with Cyrus were forced. He stands in favorable contrast with such trimmers as Syennesis. 

82,18. πρὸς ταῦτα: may be rendered in reply fo this, though Cyrus addresses the company, not the culprit.

82,20. ἀπόφηναι: 1 aorist imperative middle. — 

γνώμην ὅ τι σοι δοκεῖ: either the first word or the last three might be omitted, but they can all be translated.

82,23. ἡμῖν: Clearchus identifies himself with the rest of the company.

82,24. τὸ κατὰ τοῦτον εἶναι: a substantive infinitive used absolutely 1;
τοῦτον twice repeated, instead of αὐτόν, lends.a touch of contempt. —
ἐθελοντάς: a noun, not a participle, as the accent shows.

82,28. ἔφη: the subject is Clearchus, giving his account of the trial. 

82,26. ἔλαβον... Ὀρόνταν: seized Orontas by the girdle, the Persian way of sentencing a man to death. ζώνης is partitive genitive[GenPart] with a verb of taking hold of.2 It would have sufficed for Cyrus alone to take hold of the girdle, but he may have extended the ceremony to the rest in order to test their fidelity.

82,27. ἐπὶ θανάτῳ: thus voting for death (lit., on terms of death, i.e. on the understanding that it meant his death).

προσετάχθη: impersonal, the command was given; the subject is τὸ
ἐξάγειν, supplied from ἐξῆγον, but its omission is as natural in Greek as in English.

83,2. προσεκύνουν: expresses customary past action. The act consisted in touching the ground with the forehead and kissing the earth ; see Daniel 2. 46,1 Samuel 20. 41.

83,3. καίπερ: often used with a concessive participle.1 

ἐπὶ θάνατον: accusative with a verb of motion[AccDirec]; cp. ἐπὶ θανάτῳ, 82,27.

83,6. οὔτε... οὐδείς: for the double negative, see on 68,25. 

τεθνηκότα: the perfect participle denotes a state resulting from a completed act; see on ἐζευγμένη, etc., 56,10.

83,7. ὅπως ἀπέθανεν: Herodotus (7. 114) states that it was a Persian custom to execute by burying alive. It is not improbable that this method was adopted here. Possibly the rank and influence of Orontas, which had made it prudent to have a strong Greek guard at his trial, also rendered a secret execution advisable.

83,13. μαχούμενον: implies purpose.

83,14. δεξιοῦ: see on δεξιόν, 59,26. For the battle it is Clearchus who holds this post of danger and distinction, while for a parade (59,22 ff.) it fell to Menon, possibly indicating that in the meantime Clearchus had risen in the estimation of Cyrus and that Menon had fallen. For the position of the Greek hoplite force at the beginning of the battle, see D on the plan, p. 90. For the genitive[Gen???] δεξιοῦ, see on ὧν, 69,20.

83,17. ἡμέρᾳ: dative of association[Dat???] expressing time.3

83,20. λοχαγούς : inasmuch as the captains of the mercenaries assisted in raising their own troops (see Introd. § 56), they had much greater influence, both with their men and with the commanding officer to whom they sold their services, than is normally enjoyed by the modern captain.

83,23. ἀνθρώπων: genitive with a verb of want[GenVerb].1 Observe that ἄνδρες is used of the Greeks, and note the difference in the significance of the two words. 

ἀπορῶν, νομίζων: causal.

83,24. κρείττους: stronger.

83,25. διὰ τοῦτο: sums up νομίζων. .. εἶναι.

84,1. ὅπως. .. ἔσεσθε: the future indicative with ὅπως in an urgent command,2 de sure, therefore, to be men, etc. Although this construction probably arose from the use of ὅπως depending on a verb of striving or caring for (see on ἔσται, 52,2), it is unlikely that in Xenophon’s time any ellipsis was felt. — 

ἐλευθερίας: see on πολλοῦ, 66,16. 

ἧς: attracted from the accusative,3 in which it would naturally stand as object of κέκτησθε.

84,2. ἧς: genitive of cause[GenCause]. According to the Persian notion, Cyrus himself was the slave of the king (100, 1), who alone, of all the Persians, was free. 

τήν: with an abstract noun; cp. 77,20.

84,3. ἀντὶ ὧν, εἰς. : 2.6. ἀντὶ πάντων ἃ ἔχω; the antecedent is taken into the relative clause and attracts the relative to its own case.5—

 for the battle (see l.5), only 900,000 of the king’s forces can have taken part in the fighting. Even this number is probably an exaggeration. Ctesias, a Greek physician in the king’s suite, is said by Plutarch (Life of Artaxerxes, 13) to have given the number as 400,000. See Introd. § 13.

86,3. τῇ μάχῃ: the battle of Cunaxa, which soon followed.

86, ς. ὑστέρησε τῆς μάχης: was too late for (lit., later than1) the battle. This is in harmony with his previous conduct (see on 70,2, 74,

μέσον: see on 56,21.

86,18. ὡς: with εἴκοσι. Why the passage was left is not clear.
 Probably the king had been prevented from completing the trench by the approach of Cyrus.
86,22. παρῆλθε καὶ ἐγένοντο: the author’s thought suddenly changes. With the singular verb, Cyrus and the army are conceived of as a unit ; with the plural, they are taken separately and the soldiers making up the army are in mind.

86,24. ἦσαν: note the number, and see on ἦσαν, etc., 69,25.

87,4. ἔτι: at all.

εἰ... οὐ μαχεῖται: this is perhaps a half-ironical repetition of the seer’s words, retaining the future and the negative οὐ,1 although in a protasis. Translate if he will not fight.— 

ἐν: within. A genitive, as in l. 3, is the usual construction.

87,5. ἐὰν δ᾽ ἀληθεύσῃς: we might expect a simple present condition, but the idea is if it shall turn out (in the future) that you are speaking the truth, if you prove to be telling the truth.

87,6. δέκα τάλαντα: = 60,000 Attic drachmas, or some $10,800 (the drachma being a silver coin = about 18 cents). 3000 gold darics, equivalent to about $16,200, were given in payment. The difference in the values as expressed in our money is due to the change in the proportional values of gold and silver—silver, as used in our coinage, being worth about two thirds as much, with reference to gold, as in ancient Greece. — 

ἀπέδωκεν: cp. ἀποδιδόναι, 59,6, and see note.

87,8. ἐκώλυε : cp. ἐκώλυεν, 62,9. After all, a narrow passage would have been a poor place for the Persians to attempt to resist the Greeks, for they could not have brought into play their only strong point, superiority in numbers. — 

διαβαίνειν: see on κελεύειν, 67,22.— 

ἔδοξε: the subject is personal; see on 66,10.

87,9. ἀπεγνωκέναι: in indirect discourse (see on δοκεῖ, 66,10), the tense denoting completion, that he had definitely given up the idea of fighting. τοῦ μάχεσθαι is the genitive of separation[GenSep].

87,10. ἠμελημένως: an adverb formed from a perfect participle. —


μᾶλλον: here the comparative is weaker than its positive and means rather, somewhat ; see on ἀθυμότερος, 71,17.

87,12. τὸ... πολύ: see ON 73,13.

87,13. αὐτῷ: translate with τὸ. .. πολύ (see on οὐδένι, 63,18), the greater part of his forces. στρατιώταις (l.14) also may be rendered as a possessive genitive[§GenPos] (with ὅπλων), though, like αὐτῷ, it is really a dative of interest[DatResp], αὐτῷ implying disadvantage, στρατιωταις, advantage.
 CHAPTER 8. 


87,16. πλησίον: adverb; translate as a predicate adjective with σταθμός, which here means halting place ; usually it denotes the distance between two halting places. — 

ἔμελλε: he was intending, expectang; with the infinitive μελλω is sometimes used like the Latin first periphrastic in -urus, to denote intention or futurity.2 

καταλύειν: for breakfast.

88,1. τῶν ἀμφὶ Κῦρον: of the staff of Cyrus.

88,3. ἱδροῦντι τῷ ἵππῳ : dative of manner[DatMean]; observe the predicate position of the participle, wth his horse in a sweat. See Introd. § 13.

88,4. οἷς: for the dative[DatVerb], see on αὐτῷ, 51,14.

88,7. ὡς: apparently.

88,9. αὐτίκα: modifies ἐπιπεσεῖσθαι, but is put first because emphatic. — 

ἐδόκουν: cp. ἐδόκει, 83,12.

88,10. καὶ πάντες δέ: and in fact all; see on καί, 51,6.

88,11. σφίσιν : see on 85,5.— émmeretoOar: sc. βασιλέα as subject.

88,14. ἵππον: according to Plutarch-(quoting Ctesias), a fiery, hard-bitted charger, named Pasacas. — 

τὰ παλτά: see on 80,4.

88,16. καθίστασθαι, etc.: 20 take their positions, each in his own line; ἕκαστον is in apposition with the subject of the infinitive.

88,19. κέρατος: the right wing of the whole army, where the Greek troops were stationed ; see plan, p. 90.

88,20. ἐχόμενος : next.

89,1. ὅσον: adverb, about.

89,3. αὐτοί: the men, in contrast to the horses (l.6). See Introd.

89,4. Κύρου: the exception refers only to κράνεσι, and can be made clear in English by translating xpaveor after πάντες πλὴν Κύρου.

89,5. υιλήν: unprotected. Ctesias, according to Plutarch, says he wore a tiara (see Fig. 43, p. 130), probably as an emblem of royal authority. This, however, left head and face open to a wound —a circumstance which proved to be of great importance (94,11).

89,8. μαχαίρας: for the difference between μάχαιρα and ξίφος, see Introd. § 58 end, and Figs. 31,39, pp. 89, III.

89,10. μέσον ἡμέρας: the next division of the day after ἀγορὰ πληθουσα, 87,15.

89,26. ἄλλοι: sc. ἦσαν.

ἀνθρώπων : with an adjective of fullness. We should say ‘solid square.’ For the arrangement of troops by nations in a Persian army, see Introd. § 49.

90,2. ἐπορεύετο : agrees with the appositive, which is nearer than the subject. — 

ἅρματα: sc. ἦν (or ἦσαν, cp. εἶχον, l. 4).

90,3. διαλείποντα συχνόν: at considerable intervals.

τὰ . . . καλούμενα: in apposition with ἅρματα; for καλούμενα, see on κρήνη . ..
καλουμένη, 59,16. These chariots are described briefly by Xenophon in the Cyropaedia (6. 1. 29 f.). They had strong wheels and, to prevent their being easily overturned, long axles. The driver was protected by the high front, back, and sides of the box, or body, of the chariot, and also by armor, only his eyes being exposed. The scythes, which extended outward from the hubs, were about three feet long.

90,4. εἰς πλάγιον ἀποτεταμένα : stretching out sideways; see Fig. 27, p. 85.

90,6. ὡς διακόπτειν : see on ὡς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι, 78,17. ----

90,7. ἐλῶντα, διακόψοντα : future participles of purpose, agreeing with ἅρματα implied, as if εἶχον γνώμην (subject, τὰ ἅρματα) had preceded ; the intention was that they should drive, etc. ὡς represents the purpose as held by the chariots themselves; see on ὡς ἀποκτενῶν, 51, 1ξ.

91,7. ἡμῖν: dative of agent[DatAgent] (which is really a dative of interest 1). —


πεποίηται: the perfect sometimes gains from the context future perfect force; but the perfect may be used in translation.

91,8. Κύρου: see on Τισσαφέρνους, 56,5.

ὄντα: participle in indirect discourse; βασιλέα is its subject.

91,10. μέσον: in its substantive use, but lacking the article. For the king’s superiority in numbers, see Introd. § 13.

91,11. ἀλλ᾽ ὅμως: yet 22 spite of all, notwithstanding all this ; ὅμως stamps the participle as concessive.2

91,12. μὴ κυκλωθείη: object of a verb of fearing, the optative depending on the main verb ἡθελεν.3 The present participle denotes action going on at the time of ἤθελεν.

91,13. αὐτῷ μέλει: he was taking care; μέλει retains the form actually used by Clearchus, but the change to the optative would be as regular as in ἔχοι, 1. 14; see on 81,3. These words were naturally interpreted by Cyrus as a promise to comply with the order. The disobedience of Clearchus left Cyrus and his bodyguard unsupported to contend against overwhelming odds. See Introd. § 14.

91,14. ἔχοι: in indirect discourse for the present subjunctive ἔχῃ of direct discourse,4 that all should be well. If Clearchus had used the future indicative, which is the common construction (see on ἔσται; 52,
2), the future optative would have been required.

91,15. τὸ μὲν βαρβαρικὸν στράτευμα: that of the king.

91. 16. ὁμαλῶς : = ἐν ἴσῳ, l.2.

91,22. ἐπιστήσας: 56. τὸν ἵππον.

91,23. ἱερά, σφάγια: sc. ἐστί. Both words here mean omens; for the dfference, see σφάγιον in Vocab. Omens were drawn especially from the behavior and movements of the sacrificial victims; see p. 45, footnote, also Fig. 38, p. 107.

ἔστι δ᾽
ὅστις : 507,16 0716; we might expect ἦν, but the use of the past, as in

93,4. οὐδὲ τοῦτον : οὐδέ is intensive, not even he; like the preceding οὐδέν, it belongs grammatically with ἔφασαν (see on οὔτε . .. ἔφη, 63,
17), but in sense with παθεῖν. Note the emphatic repetition of negatives in these three lines (see on οὐδενί, 63,18). The scythe chariots, fearful as was their appearance, were seldom more efficient than here. See Introd. § 51.

93,5. οὐδ᾽... δέ: the negative of καὶ. .. δέ (see 51, 6f.), and no one else either, strengthened by οὐδείς, l.6.

93,8. νικῶντας, διώκοντας : in indirect discourse, that the Greeks had conquered and were pursuing; the present of νικάω and some other verbs often refers to a continuous state rather than to an act, and the present may then be translated as the perfect of the corresponding act 2; as ‘I am victorious over’ or ‘I have conquered.’ —

 that they had struck the fatal blow. — 

ὑπὸ τὸν ὀφθαλμόν: the accusative implies motion; cp. εἰς τὰς χεῖρας, 80,4. Plutarch (Life of Artaxerxes,
11), quoting Ctesias, says that after the king had retired from the fighting to recuperate from his wound, Cyrus had great difficulty in managing his restless horse. Finally his tiara (see on 89,5) fell off, and as he was riding through the crowd a young man, named Mithridates, not knowing who he was, struck him with a spear in one of his temples near the eye. He fell from his horse in a swoon. Presently regaining partial consciousness, he was being led away, when he was: hit from behind, and in falling struck his wounded temple on a stone, and so died.

94,21. χρυσοῦν: 45 in 63,27.

95,2. παρὰ. ... γενέσθαι: by all who seem to have been in the intimate acquaintance of Cyrus. παρά with the genitive[GenSep] denotes the source whence the admission came, and may therefore be substituted for the regular agent construction; see on ἐκ βασιλέως, 52,10.

95,11. σωφροσύνην : this quality was highly prized by the Greeks; one of the cardinal points of their philosophy was adherence to the golden mean in all things.

95,12. καταμάθοι ἄν: potential optative; it is clear that no definite protasis is present to the mind; see on 82,15.

95,15. ἔστι: cp. 76,10, and see note. This statement is probably an exaggeration, representing the ideal aimed at by the authorities rather than the actual facts, for excess and corruption were so prevalent at the Persian court that they can: hardly have been kept hidden from the youth.

95,16. καί: correlates with ἢ before ἄλλους, 1. 18.

96,6. τὰ μέν: sc. πάθη, cognate accusative[AccCog], he received some injuries; τέλος δέ correlates with it. 

ὧν καί: omit καί in translation.

96,8. πολλοῖς μακαριστόν : cp. τοῖς οἴκοι ζηλωτόν, 84,10.

96,9. κατεπέμφθη : for the force of the preposition in the compound, see on Title Ἀνάβασις, p. 227. — 

σατράπης: predicate.

96,11. οἷς καθήκει: whose duty it ts.

96,12. πρῶτον μὲν ἐπέδειξεν: correlative with φανερὸς δ᾽ ἦν, l. 25.

96,13. αὑτὸν ὅτι : see on ἀπήγγειλε... κρίσιν, 81,17. --- 

περὶ πλείστον
ποιοῖτο: ἦς considered it of greatest importance. ---- 

τῷ : = τινί. 


σπείσαιτο: is a present general condition in indirect discourse.

96,15. καὶ γὰρ οὖν: and so of course ; so τοιγαροῦν, 1.18. See γάρ in Vocab. 

ἐπίστενον: as the keynote of the passage, this verb occurs three times in this sentence. 

αὐτῷ: with ἐπίστευον and ἐπιτρεπόμεναι, trusted him and put themselves under his protection.— 

αἱ πόλεις: see 52,18-21.

96,17. μηδέν: would be οὐδέν in direct discourse, and is therefore somewhat irregular, but is used perhaps because the main verb is equivalent to a verb of hoping.2

96,18. ἐπολέμησε: see on ἠγάσθη; 53, 16.

96,19. ἑκοῦσαι: see on 53,26.

96,20. οὗτοι. .. αὐτόν: the Milesians’ fear of him is mentioned as creditable to him, because it arose from his unwillingness to abandon their exiles whom he had taken under his protection. See Introd. § 4.

96,22. ἔλεγεν: we might have had λόγῳ corresponding to ἔργῳ. —

προοῖτο : formed as if from a verb in -έω or -όω.2 There was a tendency for verbs in -μι to take on forms of the -ω conjugation. Compare the tendency in English whereby many irregular verbs have become regular, as ‘clomb,’ an old past form of ‘climb,’ has given way, except in poetry, to ‘climbed.’ The potential optative in indirect discourse changes from the form of direct discourse only in person.

ἐπεὶ... ἐγένετο: an aorist indicative in a subordinate clause does not become optative in indirect discourse.4

 change from the form of direct discourse. Contrast the meaning of κακῶς πράττω1 with that of κακῶς ποιῶ, 71,11.

96,25. φανερὸς δ᾽ ἦν... πειρώμενος : cp. δῆλος ἦν... ἀνιώμενος, 59,5, and see note. — 

ποιήσειεν: in a past general condition, a type frequent in this chapter. The apodosis is πειρώμενος, which denotes continuance in the past (at the time of ἦν).

97,1. εὔχοιτο. .. ἔστε νικῴη : in indirect discourse for εὔχεται... ἔστ᾽
ἂν νικᾷ (a temporal clause equivalent to a more vivid future condition).

97,2. ἀλεξόμενος: returning like for like. But Cyrus had ill requited his brother’s forbearance, to which he had owed his life (51,16).

97,3. καὶ γὰρ οὖν: see on 96,15. — 

πλεῖστοι, etc. : translate freely, to him far (δή) more were eager to intrust ... than to any other one man in our time. ἑνί γε ἀνδρί is somewhat parenthetical and modifies πλεῖστοι δή (although grammatically in apposition with αὐτῷ), ‘the number of persons who were eager to intrust their possessions to him was the very (δή) greatest, at least for one man.’ τῶν ἐφ᾽ ἡμῶν is partitive genitive[GenPart] limiting αὐτῷ.

97,5. οὐ... εἴποι: and yet, of course (δή), nobody would say either.
τοῦτ᾽, which is explained by the appositive clause ὡς . .. εἴα καταγελᾶν, may be omitted in translation.

97,8. ἦν: as in 78,6, with an infinitive as subject. — 

ποδῶν: genitive of separation[GenSep].

97,9. στερομένους: the present passive, as in English ‘deprived,’ has the perfect meaning ; otherwise the form required to denote a condition or state would be ἐστερημένους ; see on ἐζευγμένη, 56,10. In Persia severe punishments were in vogue, such as scourging, cutting off the ears and nose, hewing off the hands and feet, and putting out the eyes.

97. 10. ἐγένετο : it became possible; the subject is πορεύεσθαι.

97,11. μηδὲν ἀδικοῦντι: the negative μή shows the conditional force of the participle.2 — 

ἤθελεν: in a conditional relative clause equivalent to a simple past condition. In such a clause the optative is more usual, giving a general meaning, as in l.12, where we have the past general form of conditional relative clause ὅ τι προχωροίη (sc. ἔχειν.), whatever it was to his advantage to have. But such words as ὅστις, ὅπῃ. etc., in themselves convey sufficiently the idea of generality and indefiniteness, and so are sometimes found with the indicative.3

97,13. γε μέντοι : However, γε being rendered only by emphasis on τοὺς ἀγαθούς. ---

97,15. αὐτός: in person.

97,16. οὕς: repeated by τούτους, l. 17, which might have been used as its antecedent, 

τούτους οὓς ἑώρα. For ἑώρα, see on ἤθελεν, l. 11.

ἢ... κέρδος: than their mere monthly pay (sc. εἶναι) ; for κατὰ μῆνα (here used as an attributive adjective), see on κατά, 60,4.

98,3. τίς γε: τίς is emphasized by γε, any one at all.


τι: cognate accusative[AccCog] with ὑπηρετήσειεν ; translate in any way.

98,4. οὐδενί : combine the negative idea with πώποτε, and translate the dative[DatPoss] as a possessive pronoun (see on οὐδενί, 63,18) with προθμίαν, he never allowed his (lit., anybody's) zeal to go unrewarded.

98,6. Κύρῳ: dative of possessor[DatPoss]; translate Cyrus was said to have gained.

98,7. ὄντα: this and the next two participles are in indirect discourse. —

98,8. ἧς χώρας: cp. 97,17. ---

98,15. ὄντας: see on ὄντα, l.7.

98,17. κράτιστος δή : cp. the force of δή, 97,3. —

101, 22. οὐκ ἦγεν: did not advance; cp. ἄγων, 79,28. — 

παρῆλθεν : in his pursuit of the barbarian army of Cyrus (100, 18). Translate as pluperfect. —

103, 1. καὶ δὴ. .. συνῄει: the king had already changed his direction and brought his line of battle opposite into the same position (lit., arrangement) as that in which he had met them for battle the first time; i.e. instead of continuing in the direction in which he was marching when the Greeks first noticed him (101, 18-23), which would have taken him past the Greek line, he seems to have turned obliquely to the right and approached the river, so that his line of battle, when it halted, faced the Greeks, was at right angles to the river, and had one flank protected by it. Of course the greater part of his line extended far beyond the Greek army, since it was more than twice as long as the whole force of Cyrus in the first battle (see 93,19 f. and plan, p. 103).

δή : sometimes, especially with καί, almost equivalent to ἤδη.

103, 18. αἰετόν τινα... ἀνατεταμένον: a sort of golden eagle ona shield (as a background) raised aloft upon a pole. Possibly the object thus vaguely described by the Greeks, who saw the standard only from a distance, was not an eagle at all, but the upper half of a human figure partly inclosed by wings, symbolizing the chief deity of the Persians. See the top of Fig. 2, p. 18 (cp. Fig. 34, p. 95).
